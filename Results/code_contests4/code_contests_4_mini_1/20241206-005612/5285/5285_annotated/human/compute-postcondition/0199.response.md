`newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. Since `newn` is updated to be greater than `newk`, the value of `newk ** st` will be subtracted from `newn`. The specific values of `newk`, `st`, and `newn` are not provided, but it is known that `newn` will remain greater than `newk` after the operation. The variable `izv` is increased by `newizv`, but this does not affect the output statement directly as we do not know the value of `newizv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated based on the calculation, `izv` is increased by `newizv` (unknown value).
Output State: **`newn` is updated based on the calculation, `izv` is increased by `newizv` (unknown value)**
