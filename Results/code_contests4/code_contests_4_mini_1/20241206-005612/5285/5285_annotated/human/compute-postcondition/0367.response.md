The variable `newnewk` is updated by multiplying its current value by `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is equal to `newn` multiplied by `newk`, so after the execution, `newnewk` will hold the value of `(newn * newk) * newk`, which simplifies to `newn * newk^2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newn` multiplied by `newk^2`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and the condition for the loop to execute again is still based on `newnewk` being less than or equal to `newn`.

Output State: **`newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is `newn` multiplied by `newk^2`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`.**
