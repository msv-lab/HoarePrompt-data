`st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables (`i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk`) are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`**
