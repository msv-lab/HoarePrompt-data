According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `newizv` has been updated to `newizv * 2 + 1` in the last iteration.

Since `st` is greater than 0, we can assume it is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 1; `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1.**
