The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` (as stated in the initial state), this means `newnewk` will be updated to `newk * newk`, effectively squaring `newk`. The values of `newk`, `i`, `st`, and `newizv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is `newk * newk`**
