According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is a result of multiplying `newk`, and `newizv` has no direct impact on the loop condition. 

Since `newnewk` is currently less than or equal to `newn`, we need to ensure that it remains so for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we can conclude that `newn` must be at least equal to `newnewk + 1` after the multiplication. 

State: **`st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
