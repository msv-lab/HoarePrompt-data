`izv` is assigned the value of `izv + newizv`, which means that `izv` is increased by `newizv`. The states of the other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**.
