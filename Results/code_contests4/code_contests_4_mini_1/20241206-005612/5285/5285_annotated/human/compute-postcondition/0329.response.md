The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. The initial state indicates that `newk` is greater than `newn`, which suggests that `newk` is a positive value. However, the specific values of `newnewk` and `newk` are not provided. Therefore, after this operation, `newnewk` will be updated to a new value, but its exact value is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`**
