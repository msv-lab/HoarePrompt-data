The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newk` has a specific value, `newnewk` will be updated accordingly, but the exact value of `newnewk` before the operation is not provided in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `st` is 1, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `st` is 1, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`.**
