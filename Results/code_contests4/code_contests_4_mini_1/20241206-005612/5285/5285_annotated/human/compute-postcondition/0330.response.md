The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, but this condition does not change with the increment of `st`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; `st` is increased by 1**
