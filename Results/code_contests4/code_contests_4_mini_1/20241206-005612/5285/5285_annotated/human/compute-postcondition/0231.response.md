The expression `newn = newn - newk ** st` modifies the value of `newn`. The variable `newk` is less than `newnewk`, and `st` is greater than 0, so `newk ** st` will yield a positive result (as raising a positive number to a positive power results in a positive number). Therefore, `newn` will decrease by a positive value.

Since the specific values of `newn` and `newk` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `newn`, but we can conclude that it will be less than its original value.

The output state summarizes the changes that have occurred:
- `newn` is now less than its previous value.
- The specific values of `newnewk`, `st`, `i`, and `izv` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is now less than its previous value.**
