To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while newn > newk ** st:
```

For the loop to execute again, the condition `newn > newk ** st` must be true after the adjustments. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is greater than 0
- `i` is equal to `st`
- `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1)
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`
- `newn` is decreased by `newk`

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we can infer that `newn` must be less than `newnewk`, which is greater than `newk`. 

However, we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk ** st` for the loop to execute again. Given that `st` is greater than 0, `newk ** st` would be a positive value which could potentially exceed `newn` if `newn` is not adjusted properly.

Thus, we need to make sure that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st` after the previous iteration. Therefore, to maintain the loop's condition, we could infer that `newn` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than `newk ** st`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `st`; `newizv` is equal to ((2^st) - 1); `izv` is increased by `newizv`; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`**
