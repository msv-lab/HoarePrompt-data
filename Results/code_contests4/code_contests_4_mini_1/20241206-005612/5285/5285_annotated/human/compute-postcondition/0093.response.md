According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is `newk * newk` and `newn` is equal to `newk`. Thus, `newnewk` will be equal to `newn` since both are derived from `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than `newn`. This means `newk` must be adjusted such that `newk` is less than `newk` (which is a contradiction) or equivalently, `newk` must be strictly less than `newn`, meaning `newk` must be strictly less than `newk`, which is not possible. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` must be strictly less than `newn` which means `newk` must be adjusted to be less than `newk`.**
