Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is the total accumulated value from all iterations, `i` is 10, `newizv` is the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than or equal to `newn`, `mlt` is the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, and `res` is the minimum value among all calculated `mlt` values, or remains as -1 if no valid calculations occurred; and we print `res`.**
