The loop updates `newizv` through the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1` for each iteration, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = st - 1`. 

If `st` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `newizv` remains unchanged. If `st` is greater than 0, the loop will execute exactly `st` times, resulting in `newizv` being updated in each iteration.

After `st` iterations, the value of `newizv` will be calculated as follows:
- For `st = 1`: `newizv` becomes `newizv * 2 + 1` (1 time).
- For `st = 2`: `newizv` becomes `(newizv * 2 + 1) * 2 + 1` (2 times).
- For `st = 3`: `newizv` becomes `(((newizv * 2 + 1) * 2 + 1) * 2 + 1)` (3 times).
- This pattern continues for each increment of `st`.

Thus, at the end of the loop, if `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` will hold the value after all transformations for `st` iterations, while `newnewk` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is unchanged, `newizv` is updated based on the formula for `st` iterations, `i` is equal to `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, otherwise `i` is 0.**
