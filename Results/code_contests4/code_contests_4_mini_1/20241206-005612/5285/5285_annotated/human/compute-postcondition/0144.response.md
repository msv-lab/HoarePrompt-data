The loop iterates `st` times, and on each iteration, it updates `newizv` using the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`. Starting from `newizv = 0`, the values of `newizv` after each iteration are as follows:

- After 1 iteration: `newizv = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`
- After 2 iterations: `newizv = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`
- After 3 iterations: `newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 7`

Continuing this pattern, we can derive that after `st` iterations, the final value of `newizv` will be `2^st - 1`.

If `st` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `st` times, and `i` will be equal to `st - 1` after the last iteration. 

If `st` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `newizv` will remain 0, while `i` will stay at 1.

Thus, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

- If `st` is greater than 0: `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `i` is `st - 1`, and `newk` remains unchanged.
- If `st` is 0: `newizv` is 0, `i` is still 1, and `newk` remains unchanged.

Since the problem statement implies that `st` is greater than 0 (based on the output states), we focus on that case. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and `newk` remains unchanged.**
