`st` is incremented by 1, and since `st` was initially 1, after execution, `st` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`newn`, `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`**.
