`newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3, so the calculation is `3 * 2 + 1`, which equals 7. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
