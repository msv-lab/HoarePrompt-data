The code `d_osn[cur] += 1` increments the count of `cur` in the `d_osn` dictionary by 1. The initial state indicates that `cur` is 2, and `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with a default value of 0. Therefore, before executing this line, `d_osn[2]` is 0, and after executing, it will be 1. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `s`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int with default value 0, `cur` is 2; `d_osn[2]` is 1**
