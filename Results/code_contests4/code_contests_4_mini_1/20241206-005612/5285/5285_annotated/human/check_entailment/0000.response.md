Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to calculate the number of trailing zeros of the factorial of `n` in the base `b`. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: The program does not compute `n!` directly or effectively; instead, it focuses on the prime factors of the base `b`. Trailing zeros in a number's representation depend on the factors of the base `b` present in the `n!`. However, the program's logic does not accurately count the occurrences of these factors in `n!`.

2. **Prime Factorization Logic**: The program attempts to factorize `b` into its prime components, which is a step in the right direction, but the way it calculates the number of times each prime factor can divide into `n!` is incorrect. It uses an accumulation of powers without a proper counting mechanism for how many complete sets of each prime factor can be formed in `n!`.

3. **Trailing Zero Calculation**: The program's final logic, which aims to calculate `mlt`, does not correctly represent the number of trailing zeros. Trailing zeros are determined by the limiting factor among the prime factors and their powers required by the base `b`. The current implementation does not ensure this, leading to potential inaccuracies.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to implement the requirements of the problem description comprehensively and accurately, particularly in calculating the trailing zeros of `n!` when represented in base `b`. Therefore, it does not meet the problem's criteria.
