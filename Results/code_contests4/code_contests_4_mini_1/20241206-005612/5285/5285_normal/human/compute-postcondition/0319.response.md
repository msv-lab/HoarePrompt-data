According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute again as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk * st`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that after this update, `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`. This means that prior to the last iteration, `newn` must have been greater than or equal to `2 * newk * st`. 

Thus, `newn` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it remains greater than `newk * st`. 

State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk * st` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`**
