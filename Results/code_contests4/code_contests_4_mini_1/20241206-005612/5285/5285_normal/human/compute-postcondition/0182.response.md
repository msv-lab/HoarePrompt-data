The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and since `st` was originally 2, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.
