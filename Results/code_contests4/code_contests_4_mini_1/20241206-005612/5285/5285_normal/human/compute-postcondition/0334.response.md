According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, and `newn` is equal to `newk`. For the loop to execute again, since `newk` must be less than or equal to 1, `newnewk` should also be less than or equal to `newn`. 

Given that `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, if `newk` is currently equal to 1, then `newnewk` equals 1 as well, which is less than or equal to `newn`. In this case, the condition is satisfied. However, for the loop to execute again, `newk` must be less than or equal to 1, and it must be ensured that `newnewk` remains less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, we need to maintain that `newk` is less than or equal to 1.

State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, for the loop to execute again `newk` must be less than or equal to 1**.
