The value of `newnewk` is assigned the product of `newnewk` and `newk`. Since `newk` is less than or equal to 1, the multiplication will not increase `newnewk`. The exact value of `newnewk` is not provided, so we only know that it remains unchanged or becomes zero if `newnewk` was initially zero. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` is less than or equal to 1, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv`, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `st` is set to 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` remains the same after multiplication with `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` is less than or equal to 1, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv`, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `st` is set to 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` remains unchanged after multiplication with `newk`.**
