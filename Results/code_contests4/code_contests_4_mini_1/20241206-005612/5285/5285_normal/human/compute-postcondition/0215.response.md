According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`, and `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`. 

Since `newnewk` is `newk^3` and it is stated that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`, which is `newk^3`. Therefore, `newn` must be greater than `newk^3`. 

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the condition of the loop execution.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk^3`**
