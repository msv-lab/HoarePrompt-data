The value of `izv` is increased by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is not provided, so it remains unknown. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * (st + 1) with `izv` being increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * (st + 1), `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
