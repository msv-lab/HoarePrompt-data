The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. The value of `newnewk` is updated based on its previous value, which is equal to `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`. The states of the other variables (`newizv`, `izv`, `st`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is 1; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is 1; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
