According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop can execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Right before the loop, it is stated that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `st` is a non-negative integer. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `newn` must be strictly greater than `newk ** st`. Given that `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk`, we need to ensure that `newn` is adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st`. 

To achieve this, we could adjust `newn` to be greater than `newk`, ensuring that `newk ** st` is less than `newn`. 

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is equal to `(2^st) - 1`, `st` is a non-negative integer**
