The statement `continue` does not alter the values of the variables. It simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `b`, `s`, `d_osn[cur]`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1; `cur` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
