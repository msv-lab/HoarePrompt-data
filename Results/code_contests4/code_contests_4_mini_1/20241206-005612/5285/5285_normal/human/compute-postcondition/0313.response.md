To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop condition: `newn > newk ** st`. 

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - `newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`.
   - `newk` is greater than `newn`.
   - `st` is the number of iterations.
   - `izv` is 0.
   - `newizv` is `2^st - 1`.

2. **Analyzing the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, we need `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`.
   - Since `newk` is greater than `newn`, raising `newk` to the power of `st` (where `st` is non-negative) will only increase its value, making it even more likely that `newk ** st` is greater than `newn`.

3. **Adjustments needed**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the relationship such that `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`. 
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that `newk` is less than `1`, or that `st` is `0`, making the expression `newk ** st` equal to `1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `newk` is less than `1` or `st` is `0`.
   
State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is `st`, `st` is the number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must be less than or equal to `newn` or `st` is 0.**
