`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 0, so the calculation will be `0 * 2 + 1`, which results in `1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 1, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 1, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1**
