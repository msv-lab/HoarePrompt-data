According to the code, the `while` loop is structured as `while True and i < 10`. Since the condition starts with `True`, the execution of the loop will depend solely on the condition `i < 10`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. Since 0 is less than 10, the loop can execute. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, and `i` is 0**
