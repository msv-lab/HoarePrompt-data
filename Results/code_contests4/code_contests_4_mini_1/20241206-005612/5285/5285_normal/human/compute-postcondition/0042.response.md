Postcondition: ***`b` is 1, `s` is the number of prime factors of the original value of `n`, `d_osn` contains the counts of all prime factors of the original value of `n`, and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of the initial value of `b`. If `b` is greater than 2, `d_osn[1]` is increased by 1.***
