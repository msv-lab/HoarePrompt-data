The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not impacted by this assignment. The state of `newn`, `newk`, `i`, and `st` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `newizv` is 0**
