The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, and `st` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
