The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unaffected by other variables except for the newly assigned value of `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `1`.**
