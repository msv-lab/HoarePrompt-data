`izv` is incremented by `newizv`, but the previous value of `izv` is not specified. The other variables, `newn` and `newk`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
