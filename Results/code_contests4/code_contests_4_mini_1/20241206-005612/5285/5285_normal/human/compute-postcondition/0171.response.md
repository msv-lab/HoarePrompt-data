The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 0.
