The code initializes `d_osn` as a defaultdict of integers. This means that `d_osn` can now hold integer values with keys that can be any hashable type, and any key that is accessed but not yet set will automatically have a default value of 0.

The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is initialized as a defaultdict of int.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is initialized as a defaultdict of int.**
