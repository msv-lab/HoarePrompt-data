`st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value was 1, the new value of `st` becomes 2. The other variables `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, and `newnewk` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`.

Output State: **`st` is 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`**.
