`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 2, so after execution, `st` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` to the power of 4, for the loop to execute again `newk` must be less than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 3, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` to the power of 4, for the loop to execute again `newk` must be less than or equal to 1.**
