According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `st`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `newn` is less than or equal to 1, it does not affect the iteration count directly. The variable `st` is greater than 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 2.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 1**
