The variable `st` is initialized to 0. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, and `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0**
