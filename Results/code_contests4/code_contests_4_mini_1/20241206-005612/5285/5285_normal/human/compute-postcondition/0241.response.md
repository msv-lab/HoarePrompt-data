The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `st`, and `izv` remain unaffected. Since `st` is currently 0, and it is less than 10, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is now 0; variable `i` is increased by 1.
