The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is `(2^st - 1) * st`, and `newizv` is `2^st - 1`. Therefore, after execution, `izv` becomes `((2^st - 1) * st) + (2^st - 1)`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is `((2^st - 1) * st) + (2^st - 1)`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`.**
