The code snippet `newnewk *= newk` multiplies the current value of `newnewk` by `newk`. However, the initial state does not specify the current value of `newnewk` or `newk`. Since we don't have those values, we cannot determine the exact impact on the variables. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` remains unchanged as we don't have its value.

Output State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` remains unchanged.**
