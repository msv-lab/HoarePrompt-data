`newnewk` is updated by multiplying it by `newk`. The initial value of `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, and since `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `newnewk` will still be less than or equal to `newn` after the operation, assuming `newk` is not zero. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`.**
