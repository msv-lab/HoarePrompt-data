The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The values of `newn`, `i`, `st`, and `newizv` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk**
