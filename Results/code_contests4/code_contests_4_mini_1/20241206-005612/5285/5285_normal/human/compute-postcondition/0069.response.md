`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which results in `newizv` being 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
