The value of `st` is incremented by 1 from its previous value of 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`; `newn` is less than or equal to 1; `st` is 2; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`; `newn` is less than or equal to 1; `st` is 2; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0**
