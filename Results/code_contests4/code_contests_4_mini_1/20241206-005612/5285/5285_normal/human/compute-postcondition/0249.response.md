`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is 2; variable `i` is increased by 1.
