The variable `newizv` is updated to the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3, so the calculation is as follows: 

`newizv` = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.

The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 7, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, and `st` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
