According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`**
