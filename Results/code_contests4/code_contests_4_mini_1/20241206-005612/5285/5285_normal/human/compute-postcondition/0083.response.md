The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`. The values of `newk` and `st` are not provided directly, so we cannot compute the exact new value of `newn`. Other variables `b`, `s`, `izv`, and `newk` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is updated based on `newizv`, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, and `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`.**
