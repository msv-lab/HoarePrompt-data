The value of `cur` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The values of the other variables (`n` and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `cur` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `cur` is increased by 2**
