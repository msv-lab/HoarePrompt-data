The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3, so after execution, `newizv` becomes `3 * 2 + 1`, which is `6 + 1 = 7`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 3, `st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 3, `st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
