According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `b` for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1**
