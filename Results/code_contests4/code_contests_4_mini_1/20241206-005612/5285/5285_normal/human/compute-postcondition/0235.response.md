According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The loop will execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated to a value that is `newn - newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk`. 

Since `newn` is now `newn - newk`, it would only be greater than `newk` if the original value of `newn` was greater than `2 * newk`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that.

State: **`newn` is updated to a value that is `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must have been greater than `2 * newk`**
