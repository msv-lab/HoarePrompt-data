The value of `i` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `i` was `11`, so now `i` is updated to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, `st` is determined by the next valid computation, `newizv` corresponds to the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.
