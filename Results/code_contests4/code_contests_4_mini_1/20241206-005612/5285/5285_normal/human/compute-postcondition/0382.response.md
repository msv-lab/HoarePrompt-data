After analyzing the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations, we conclude the following:

The loop iterates `st` times, where `st` is a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute. During each iteration, `newizv` is updated according to the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`, which means that `newizv` doubles and adds 1 in each iteration. After `st` iterations, the final value of `newizv` can be calculated as follows:

- After 1 iteration: `newizv` is 1
- After 2 iterations: `newizv` is 3
- After 3 iterations: `newizv` is 7
- ...
- After `st` iterations: `newizv` will be `2^st - 1`.

Therefore, at the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `st - 1`, and `izv` will be increased by `newizv` multiplied by `st`.

If `st` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `newizv` remains at its initial value of 0. 

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished (considering both cases where `st` is 0 or greater than 0), we have:

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `(2^st - 1) * st`, `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, and `st` is a non-negative integer.**
