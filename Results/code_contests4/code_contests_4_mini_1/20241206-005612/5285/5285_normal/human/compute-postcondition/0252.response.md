`st` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `st` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is 3; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
