The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with the value of `newk`. The previous value of `newnewk` is not specified, but after execution, it will be `newnewk * newk`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`**
