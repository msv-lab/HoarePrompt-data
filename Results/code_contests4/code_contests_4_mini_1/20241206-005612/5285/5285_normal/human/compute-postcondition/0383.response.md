To determine if the loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

1. The expression `newnewk` is defined as `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
2. Given that `st` is a non-negative integer, `newk ** st` will always be non-negative as well.
3. The loop condition checks if `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`. For the loop to execute, `newn` must be strictly greater than `newk ** st`.

From the provided state:
- `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, which means `newn >= newk ** st`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once:
- We need to ensure that `newn` is strictly greater than `newk ** st`, which means we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk ** st`).

Thus, we need to adjust the state so that `newn` is strictly greater than `newnewk`. 

State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `(2^st - 1) * st`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`, thus `newn > newk ** st` must hold.**
