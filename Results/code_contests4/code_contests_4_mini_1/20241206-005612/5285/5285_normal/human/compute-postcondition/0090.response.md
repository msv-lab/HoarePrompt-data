To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `newnewk <= newn`. Right before the loop, we have the following states:

- `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`
- `newk` is less than or equal to `n`
- `st` is set to 0
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk`

From the given information, we know that `newk` raised to the power of `st` when `st` is 0 is always 1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, we can conclude:

- `newn` is less than or equal to 1 (because `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, which is `newk^0`, or 1).

For the loop to execute at least once, we require that `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk`) must be less than or equal to `newn`. Given that `newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` must also be less than or equal to 1 for the condition to hold true.

Thus, we need to ensure that both `newn` and `newk` are adjusted to be equal to or less than 1. 

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` is less than or equal to 1, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv` added during all iterations, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `st` is set to 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
