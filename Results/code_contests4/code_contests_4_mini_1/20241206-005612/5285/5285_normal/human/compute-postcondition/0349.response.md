The variable `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, and `newizv` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact effect on `izv`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newk` is greater than 1, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newk` is greater than 1, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
