According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `st` must be greater than 3.

State: **`newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 3, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 3.**
