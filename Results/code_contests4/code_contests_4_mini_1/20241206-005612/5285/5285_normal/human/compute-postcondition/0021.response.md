The variable `b` is assigned the value of `b` divided by `cur`. The initial value of `b` is greater than 1, and `cur` is a positive integer, so the result of the division will still be a positive number. Since `b` is modified and its previous value is not known, we cannot specify an exact numerical output for `b` after the operation. The state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now modified to `b / cur`, and `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now modified to `b / cur`; `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1.**
