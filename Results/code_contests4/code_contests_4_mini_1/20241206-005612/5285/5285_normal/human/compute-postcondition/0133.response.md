`st` is incremented by 1, and since `st` was initially 2, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 1; `st` is 3; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 1; `st` is 3; `i` is 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
