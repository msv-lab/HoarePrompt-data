The loop executes a number of times determined by the value of `st`. In each iteration, `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1`. This results in a series of values for `newizv` that follows the pattern of `2^i - 1` for each iteration `i`, starting from `i = 0`.

Given that, if `st` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `st` times. The value of `newizv` after all iterations will be `2^st - 1`.

At the end of the loop, the values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial state since the loop only modifies `newizv` and `i`. The final value of `i` will be equal to `st` after the loop concludes.

Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `st`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.**
