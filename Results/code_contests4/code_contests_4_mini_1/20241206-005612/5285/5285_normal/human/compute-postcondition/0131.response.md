According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to 1, but we do not know the specific value of `newnewk`. If `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. 

Since `newn` is currently less than or equal to 1, `newnewk` must also be adjusted to be less than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `newn` is less than or equal to 1, `st` is 2, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0 and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` currently must be less than or equal to 1**
