The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The initial value of `izv` is 0, and `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`. Since `st` is greater than or equal to 0, we can evaluate `newizv`. When `st` is 0, `newizv` becomes `2^0 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1`. Therefore, `izv` becomes `0 + (-1) = -1` if `st` is 0. If `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` would be a positive value and `izv` would increase accordingly.

However, since we do not have the specific value of `st`, we can only conclude that `izv` will be updated based on the value of `newizv`. The final state can be expressed as: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is updated based on `newizv`, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `st`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is updated based on `newizv`, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `st`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.**
