The value of `i` is incremented by 1, where `i` was initially equal to `st`, which is 0. Thus, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv` added during all iterations, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1, and `st` is set to 0.
