The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Since `newn` is initially greater than `newk`, the updated value of `newn` will still remain positive, but the exact result is unknown without specific values for `newk` and `st`. The other variable `izv` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated to a value that is `newn - newk ** st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated to a value that is `newn - newk ** st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
