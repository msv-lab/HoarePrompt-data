The value of `st` is assigned the value 0, which remains unchanged as it was already 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `1`.
