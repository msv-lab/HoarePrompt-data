`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared**
