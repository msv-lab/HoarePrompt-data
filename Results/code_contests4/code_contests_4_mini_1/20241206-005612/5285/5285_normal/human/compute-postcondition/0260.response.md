The initial state shows that `newizv` is currently 1. The line of code updates `newizv` by multiplying it by 2 and then adding 1. 

Calculating the new value:
- `newizv = 1 * 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`

The other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, `izv`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is equal to `newizv` multiplied by `st`, and `newizv` is now 3; the final value of `i` is `i_initial + st + 1`.**
