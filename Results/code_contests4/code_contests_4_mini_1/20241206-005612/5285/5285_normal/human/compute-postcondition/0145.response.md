To determine whether the `while` loop will execute, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

1. We know that `newn` is less than or equal to `1`.
2. The term `newk ** st` represents `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `st` is greater than or equal to `0`, `newk ** st` will be `1` if `newk` is `1` or greater. If `newk` is less than `1`, `newk ** st` will be less than or equal to `1` when `st` is `0` and greater than `0` when `st` is greater than `0`.

For the loop to execute at least once, we require the condition `newn > newk ** st` to be true. Given that `newn` is at most `1`, we need to consider the values of `newk` and `st`:

- If `newk` is `1`, then `newk ** st` will also be `1` for any non-negative `st`, and `newn` will not be greater than `newk ** st` since `newn` can be at most `1`.
- If `newk` is less than `1`, `newk ** st` will be less than or equal to `1`, and `newn` can be greater than this value if `newn` is slightly above `1`. Thus, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we could adjust `newn` to be greater than `1`, or we could adjust `newk` to be less than `1` to keep `newk ** st` lower than `newn`.

Since `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, it must be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st` for the loop to execute. 

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st` and `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `1` if `newk` is `1`**.
