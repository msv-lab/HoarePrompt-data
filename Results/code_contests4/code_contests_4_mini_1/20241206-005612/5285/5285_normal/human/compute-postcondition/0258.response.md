The value of `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which results in `newizv` being 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is equal to `newizv` multiplied by `st`, the final value of `i` is the initial value of `i` plus `st`, and `newizv` is now 1.
