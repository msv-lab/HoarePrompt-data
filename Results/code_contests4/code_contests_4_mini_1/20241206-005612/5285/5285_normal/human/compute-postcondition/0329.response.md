The line `newnewk *= newk` results in `newnewk` being multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is currently equal to `newk`, this means that `newnewk` will be squared (multiplied by itself). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared**
