The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is 0, and `newizv` is 0, so after execution, `izv` remains 0 (0 + 0). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be at least 2.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be at least 2.**
