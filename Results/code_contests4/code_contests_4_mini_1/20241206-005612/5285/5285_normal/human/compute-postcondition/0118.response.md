The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The previous state indicates that `newn` is greater than `newk * (st + 1)`, and since `st` is equal to `i`, `newk ** st` will be computed. The exact numerical values of `newk`, `st`, and `newn` are not provided, but we know that `newn` will decrease by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `newn` while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is the number of iterations; `i` is equal to `st`; `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`; `izv` is now increased by `newizv`.**
