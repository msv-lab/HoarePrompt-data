The code assigns a new value to `newizv`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3, so the calculation will be:

`newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 2, `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 2, `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
