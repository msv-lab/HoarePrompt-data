The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the values of other variables, which remain as follows: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv` added during all iterations, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, and `i` is 1, with `st` set to 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv` added during all iterations, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is set to 0, `newizv` is 0**
