The value of `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. Given that `newizv` is initially 1, the calculation becomes `1 * 2 + 1`, which results in `3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1**
