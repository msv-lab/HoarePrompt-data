`st` is incremented by 1, so its new value becomes 3. The other variables `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newnewk`, and `newk` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 3, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`.

Output State: **`st` is 3, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk**
