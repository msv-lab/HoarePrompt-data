`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since `newk` is not specified but is part of the initial state where `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, we cannot determine the exact value of `newnewk`. The values of the other variables (`st`, `i`, and `newizv`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 0; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.**
