`st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 1, after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, and for the loop to execute again, `newk` must be less than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, and for the loop to execute again, `newk` must be less than or equal to 1.**
