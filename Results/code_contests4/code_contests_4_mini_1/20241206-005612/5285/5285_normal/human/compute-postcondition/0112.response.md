The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we know that `newk ** st` will be a positive value, thereby reducing `newn`. The values of `st`, `i`, and `izv` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st.**
