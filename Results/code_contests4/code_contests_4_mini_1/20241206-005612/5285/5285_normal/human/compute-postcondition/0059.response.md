The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`. Since `newnewk` is initially not defined in the provided state, we can conclude that `newnewk` would be assigned the value of `newk` (which is less than or equal to `n`) on its first usage. Therefore, `newnewk` will take the value of `newk` squared. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated to be `newk` squared.**
