The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, after this operation, `newnewk` will be updated to `newnewk * newk`, which is equivalent to `newk^2 * newk` or `newk^3`. The value of `newk` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`newn`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, and for the loop to execute again, `newk` must be less than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed, and for the loop to execute again, `newk` must be less than or equal to 1.**
