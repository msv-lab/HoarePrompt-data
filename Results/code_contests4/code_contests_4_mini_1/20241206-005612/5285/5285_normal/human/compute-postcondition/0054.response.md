The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. Since the value of `newk` is unknown, we cannot determine a specific value for `newnewk`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is an unknown value, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is initialized to 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is an unknown value, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is initialized to 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.**
