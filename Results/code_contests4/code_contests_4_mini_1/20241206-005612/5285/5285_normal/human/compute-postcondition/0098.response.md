The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `st` was increased by 1, so it is now greater than its previous value. Other variables (`newn`, `newnewk`, `newk`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newnewk` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` remains unchanged, and `st` is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newnewk` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` remains unchanged, and `st` is increased by 1.**
