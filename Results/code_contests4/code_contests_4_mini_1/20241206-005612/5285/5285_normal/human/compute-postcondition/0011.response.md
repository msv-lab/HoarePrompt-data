The variable `cur` is assigned the value 3. The previous value of `cur` was 2, but it is now updated to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int; `cur` is 3; `b` is not divisible by `cur` (i.e., `b % 2 ≠ 0`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int; `cur` is 3; `b` is not divisible by `cur` (i.e., `b % 2 ≠ 0`).**
