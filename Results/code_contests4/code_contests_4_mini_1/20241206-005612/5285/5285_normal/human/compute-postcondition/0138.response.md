According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is greater than 0, as `range(st)` generates a sequence from 0 to `st - 1`. Since `st` is equal to 0 in the provided state, the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `st` must be adjusted to a value greater than 0. The values of `newnewk`, `newn`, `i`, and `newizv` do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute in this scenario, but they are part of the overall program state. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to set `st` to be greater than 0.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0**
