The value of `cur` is incremented by 2. However, the initial value of `cur` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `cur`. The previous values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `cur` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `cur` is increased by 2.**
