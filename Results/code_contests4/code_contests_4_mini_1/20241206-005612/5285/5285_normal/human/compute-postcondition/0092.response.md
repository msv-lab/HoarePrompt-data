The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` is less than or equal to 1, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv`, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` remains unchanged after multiplication with `newk`.
