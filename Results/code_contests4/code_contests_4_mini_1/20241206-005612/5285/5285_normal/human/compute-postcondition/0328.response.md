According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` needs to be equal to `newnewk`, which is equal to `newk`. Additionally, because `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk`, it needs to be adjusted so that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.

State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
