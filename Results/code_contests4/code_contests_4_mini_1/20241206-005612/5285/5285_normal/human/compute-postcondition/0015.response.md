Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; if `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is updated to `b / 2`, `s` remains 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1, and `cur` stays 2. If `b` is not divisible by `cur`, then `cur` is updated to 3 if it was originally 2, or increased by 2 otherwise.***
