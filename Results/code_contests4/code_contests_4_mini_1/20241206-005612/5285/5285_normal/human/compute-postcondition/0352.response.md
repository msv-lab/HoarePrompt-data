The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, and `newizv` is also unknown. The state of `newn` and `st` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is `newk - 1`, `st` is 0, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is `newk - 1`, `st` is 0, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
