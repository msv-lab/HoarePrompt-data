The variable `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newk` remains unchanged and the value of `newnewk` must be less than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again, the result of `newnewk *= newk` means that `newnewk` will still remain less than or equal to 1 after the operation. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newnewk` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` remains unchanged, and `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newnewk` is less than or equal to 1, `newk` remains unchanged, and `st` is increased by 1.**
