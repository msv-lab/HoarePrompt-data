The value of `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation becomes `0 * 2 + 1`, which results in `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, and `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
