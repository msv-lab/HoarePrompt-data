`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since the initial value of `newizv` is 0, the calculation results in `newizv` being updated to `0 * 2 + 1`, which equals 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
