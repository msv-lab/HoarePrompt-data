The value of `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value (which is 3) by 2 and then adding 1. Therefore, the new value of `newizv` becomes \(3 \times 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\). The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 7, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`**
