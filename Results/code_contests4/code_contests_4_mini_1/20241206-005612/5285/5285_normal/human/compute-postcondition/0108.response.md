The value of `newizv` is modified by the calculation `newizv * 2 + 1`. However, the initial value of `newizv` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `newizv`. The other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state reflects that `newizv` has been updated based on its previous value.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 3; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
