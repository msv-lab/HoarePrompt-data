The value of `d_osn[b]` is incremented by 1. Given that `b` is 1, the value of `d_osn[1]` will increase by 1. The other variables `s`, `cur`, and the conditions regarding `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is the number of prime factors of the original value of `n`, `d_osn` contains the counts of all prime factors of the original value of `n`, and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of the initial value of `b`; `d_osn[1]` is now increased by 1.
