The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop where the condition `newk <= 1` was being evaluated. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is increased by `st`, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, and `st` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
