`newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `izv` is `0`, and since `newizv` is directly assigned `0`, it does not change any previously defined variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0**
