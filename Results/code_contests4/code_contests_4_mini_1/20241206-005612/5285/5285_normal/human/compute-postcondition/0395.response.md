Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the accumulated sum based on the values of `newizv` calculated during the iterations, `i` is 10, `st` is the last computed value of `st` before termination, `newizv` is the last computed value of `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of the last value of `st`, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, and `res` is equal to -1.***
