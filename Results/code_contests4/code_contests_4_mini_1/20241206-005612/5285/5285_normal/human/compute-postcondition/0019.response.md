According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `b` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is greater than 1, which means the loop can still execute. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the variables to allow the loop to run one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1**
