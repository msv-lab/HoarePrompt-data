The value of `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Given that `newizv` is currently 3, we calculate the new value: 

newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Other variables such as `newnewk`, `st`, `izv`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is equal to `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newizv` is now 7, and the final value of `i` is `i_initial + st + 2`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is equal to `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newizv` is now 7, and the final value of `i` is `i_initial + st + 2`.**
