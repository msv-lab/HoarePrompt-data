The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` corresponds to the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.**
