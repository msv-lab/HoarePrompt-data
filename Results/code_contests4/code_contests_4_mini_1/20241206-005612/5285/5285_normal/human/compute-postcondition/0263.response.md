The loop executes `st` times. In each iteration, `newizv` is updated by multiplying the current value by 2 and then adding 1. 

1. After the first iteration, `newizv` becomes `1`.
2. After the second iteration, `newizv` becomes `3`.
3. After the third iteration, `newizv` becomes `7`.

This pattern indicates that after `st` iterations, `newizv` can be expressed as `2^st - 1`, since it effectively counts the number of binary representations of numbers from `0` to `st-1`.

At the end of the loop, the values of the variables are:
- `newnewk` remains `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
- `st` is greater than 0.
- `izv` is `newizv` multiplied by `st`, which will be `(2^st - 1) * st`.
- The final value of `i` will be `i_initial + st - 1` (since the loop runs `st` times, it will add `st` to the initial value of `i`, but we count from 0).
- `newizv` will be `2^st - 1`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is equal to `(2^st - 1) * st`, the final value of `i` is `i_initial + st - 1`, and `newizv` is `2^st - 1`.**
