The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. Since `st` is 0, `newk ** st` evaluates to `1` (any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, `newn` is updated to `newn - 1`. The values of `newk`, `st`, and `izv` do not change. The output state reflects the updated value of `newn`.

Output State: **`newn` is `newn - 1`, `st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
