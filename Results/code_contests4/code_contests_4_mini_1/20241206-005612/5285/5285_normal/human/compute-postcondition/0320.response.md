The value of `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. Since the previous value of `izv` is unknown, we only know that it is updated. The other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `st`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated to `newn - newk * st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk * st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
