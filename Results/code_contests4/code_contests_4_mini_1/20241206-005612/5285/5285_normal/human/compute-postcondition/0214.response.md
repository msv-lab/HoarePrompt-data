The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and since `st` was initially 1, after execution, `st` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk^3`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk^3**
