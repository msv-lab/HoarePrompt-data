`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1, so after execution, `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 2, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`.
Output State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 2, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
