According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `st` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 3.

State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 3, `st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
