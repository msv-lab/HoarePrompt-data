The value of `b` is divided by `cur`, where `cur` is 2. This means `b` is updated to `b / 2`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `d_osn[cur]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is updated to `b / 2`; `s` is 0; `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1; `cur` is 2.**
