According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `st`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
