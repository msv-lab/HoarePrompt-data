The value of `st` is assigned 0. Since `st` is being reset to 0, the previous value of `st` is overwritten. The other variables `newnewk`, `newn`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is equal to the previous value of `st`, which has now been reset to 0, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is equal to 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^0**
