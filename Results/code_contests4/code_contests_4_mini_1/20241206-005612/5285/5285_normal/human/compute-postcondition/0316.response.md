According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk` after this update.

If `newn` is currently equal to `newk`, then the loop will not execute again. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than `newk`. This could mean ensuring that `newn` is at least `newk + 1`.

State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`**
