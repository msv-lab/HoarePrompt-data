According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `st`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 2, `newizv` is 3, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
