The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `newizv` was already `newizv`, which corresponds to the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`. Since `newizv` is being set to `0`, it overrides whatever value it had before. The other variables (`newn`, `izv`, `i`, `st`, `newk`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.

Output State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.**
