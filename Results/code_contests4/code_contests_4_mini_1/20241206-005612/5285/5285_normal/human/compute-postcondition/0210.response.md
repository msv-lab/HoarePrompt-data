The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, the operation effectively computes `newnewk = newk * newk`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk * newk`**
