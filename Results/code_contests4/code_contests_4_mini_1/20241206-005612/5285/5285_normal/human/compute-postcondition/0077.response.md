The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. The previous value of `newn` is equal to `n`, and `newk` is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `st` is known to be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `newn` after the operation.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is updated based on `newizv`, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value, `i` is equal to `st`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.**
