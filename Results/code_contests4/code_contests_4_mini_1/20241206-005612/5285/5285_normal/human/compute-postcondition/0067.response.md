Postcondition: ***`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is equal to 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`. If `st` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
