The code increments the value of `d_osn[cur]` by 1. The value of `cur` is 2, and `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int, which means that if `cur` is not already a key in `d_osn`, it will be initialized to 0 before the increment. Therefore, `d_osn[2]` will be increased by 1.

Since `s`, `n`, and `b` are not directly affected by this operation, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn[cur]` has been incremented by 1; `cur` is 2.**
