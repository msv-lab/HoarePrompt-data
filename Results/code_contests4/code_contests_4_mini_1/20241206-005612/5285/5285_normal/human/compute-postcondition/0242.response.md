The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not change any other variables, but it does define `newizv` as `0`. The previous states of `newn`, `newk`, `st`, `izv`, and `i` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is now 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0.**
