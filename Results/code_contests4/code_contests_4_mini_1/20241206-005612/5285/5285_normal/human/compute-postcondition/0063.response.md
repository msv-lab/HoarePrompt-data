`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2, so after execution, `st` is 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`.**
