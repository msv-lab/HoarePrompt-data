The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk`, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of (`st + 1`), and `st` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
