The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and since `newnewk` is initially equal to `newk` raised to the power of `1`, it remains equal to `newk`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
