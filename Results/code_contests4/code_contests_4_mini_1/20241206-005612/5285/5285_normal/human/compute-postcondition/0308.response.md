According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 2, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
