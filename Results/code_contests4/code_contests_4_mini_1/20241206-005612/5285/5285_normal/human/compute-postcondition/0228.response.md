To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we first analyze the loop structure and how the variables interact.

1. The loop iterates `st` times. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, stopping once it reaches `st - 1`.
2. In each iteration, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.
3. The initial value of `newizv` is 0.

We can derive the value of `newizv` after each iteration:
- After the 1st iteration (i=0): `newizv = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`
- After the 2nd iteration (i=1): `newizv = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`
- After the 3rd iteration (i=2): `newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 7`

This pattern continues such that, after `st` iterations, the value of `newizv` can be expressed as:
- `newizv = (2^st) - 1`

Now, considering the conditions:
- If `st` is equal to 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `newizv` as 0.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- If `st > 0`, `newizv` will be `(2^st) - 1`.
- If `st = 0`, `newizv` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is equal to `(2^st) - 1`, `st` is a non-negative integer.**
