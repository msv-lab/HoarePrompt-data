The value of `newizv` is updated to be `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since the initial state indicates that `newizv` is 1, the calculation will be: `newizv = 1 * 2 + 1`, which results in `newizv` becoming 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, and `st` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
