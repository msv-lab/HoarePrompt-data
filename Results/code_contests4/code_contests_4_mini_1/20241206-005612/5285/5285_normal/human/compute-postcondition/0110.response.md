According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop can execute if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `i` is equal to `st`
- `newizv` is equal to (2^st - 1)

Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this means that `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk ** st` for the loop to execute. 

Since `st` is equal to `i`, we can express this condition as:
- For the loop to execute, we need `newn` to be greater than `newk ** i`.

Thus, we need to ensure:
- `newk` should also be adjusted if necessary, depending on the relationship between `newk`, `newn`, and `st`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`**
