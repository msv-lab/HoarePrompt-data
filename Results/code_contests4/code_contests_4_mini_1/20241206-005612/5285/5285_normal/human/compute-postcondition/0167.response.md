The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of other variables (`izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `newk`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.**
