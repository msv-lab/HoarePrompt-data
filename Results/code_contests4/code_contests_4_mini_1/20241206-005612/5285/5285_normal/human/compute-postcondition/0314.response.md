The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is 0, and `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1`. Since `st` represents the number of iterations, `newizv` will have a specific value based on that. The other variables (`newn`, `i`, and `newk`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is equal to `0 + newizv`, `i` is `st`, and `newizv` is `2^st - 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is equal to `0 + newizv`, `i` is `st`, and `newizv` is `2^st - 1**
