The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous state of `izv` is unknown, and the state of `newizv` is also not provided. However, since `izv` is updated, it will now hold the new value after adding `newizv`. The values of `newn` and `newk` are not directly affected, but it is noted that for the loop to execute again, `newn` must still be greater than `newk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated based on the subtraction of `newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` must be greater than `newk` for the loop to continue.

Output State: **`newn` is updated based on the subtraction of `newk`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` must be greater than `newk` for the loop to continue.**
