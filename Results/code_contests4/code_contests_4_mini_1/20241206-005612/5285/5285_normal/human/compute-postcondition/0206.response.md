The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is known to be less than 10. Therefore, after execution, `i` will be at least 1 and less than or equal to 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0, and `i` is incremented by 1**
