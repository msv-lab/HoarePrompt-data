Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the accumulated sum based on the values of `newizv` calculated during the iterations, `i` is 10, `st` is the last computed value of `st` before termination, `newizv` is the last computed value of `2^st - 1`, and `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of the last value of `st`. If `res` is equal to -1, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`, which is `izv // d_osn[k]`. If `res` is not -1, and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to equal `mlt`.***
