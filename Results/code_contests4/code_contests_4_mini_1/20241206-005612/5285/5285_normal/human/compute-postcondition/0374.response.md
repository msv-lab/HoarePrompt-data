The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, and `st` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
