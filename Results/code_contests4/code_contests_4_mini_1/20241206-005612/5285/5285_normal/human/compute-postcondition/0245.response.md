Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is now 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` multiplied by `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk` since it was initialized to `newk`).**
