The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `st` is 1, after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying with `newk`.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying with `newk`.**
