According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is greater than 0. Given that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, we know that `newk` will always be non-negative, which means `st` must also be non-negative. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `st` must be adjusted to be at least 1. 

Since the loop index `i` starts at 0 and increments up to `st - 1`, it is set to 0 for the first iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `st` is at least 1, and that `i` starts at 0.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `st` is greater than 0**
