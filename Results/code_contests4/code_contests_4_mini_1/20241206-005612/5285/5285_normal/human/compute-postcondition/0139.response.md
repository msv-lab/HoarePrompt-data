The value of `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation yields `0 * 2 + 1`, which results in 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1**.
