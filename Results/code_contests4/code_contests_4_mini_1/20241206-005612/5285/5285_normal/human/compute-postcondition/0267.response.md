To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition specified in the `while` statement: `newn > newk ** st`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`
- `st` is greater than 0
- `izv` is `((2^st - 1) * st) + (2^st - 1)`
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `newn` is decreased by `newk`

For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`.

Since `newn` is decreased by `newk`, we can conclude:
1. If the previous value of `newn` (before reduction) was greater than `newk ** st`, then after decreasing it by `newk`, it may or may not still be greater than `newk ** st`.
2. Therefore, we need to ensure that the value of `newn` before the decrease was greater than `newk ** st` and that the resulting value after the decrease is also greater than `newk ** st`.

To ensure this, we can adjust the state of `newn` to reflect that it needs to be greater than `newk ** st` after the decrement. Thus, we can say that `newn` must be at least `newk ** st + newk` before the next iteration.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is `((2^st - 1) * st) + (2^st - 1)`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st + newk`**
