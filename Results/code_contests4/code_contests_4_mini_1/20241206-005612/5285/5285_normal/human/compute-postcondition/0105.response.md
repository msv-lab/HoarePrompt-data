According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is at least 1. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented to 2. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2**
