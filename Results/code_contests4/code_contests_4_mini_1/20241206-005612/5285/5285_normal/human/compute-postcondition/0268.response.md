`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, where `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1`. Therefore, the new value of `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, but the specific previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are not provided. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is updated, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`.
