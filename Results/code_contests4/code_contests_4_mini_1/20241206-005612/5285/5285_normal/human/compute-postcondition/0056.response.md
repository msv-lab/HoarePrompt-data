The value of `newnewk` is assigned the product of its current value and the value of `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, after this operation, `newnewk` will be equal to `newk` squared. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is initialized to 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared.
