The variable `izv` is updated by adding `newizv` to its previous value. The values of other variables (`newnewk`, `newk`, `newn`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `newk`, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, and `newn` must be greater than `newk` after `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk`, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, and `newn` must be greater than `newk` after `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`.**
