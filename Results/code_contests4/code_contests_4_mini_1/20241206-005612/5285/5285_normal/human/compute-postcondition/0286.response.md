`newn` is assigned the value of `n`. The previous state indicates that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`. The values of `izv`, `i`, `st`, `newizv`, `res`, and `mlt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 11, `st` is determined by the next valid computation, `newizv` corresponds to the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.
