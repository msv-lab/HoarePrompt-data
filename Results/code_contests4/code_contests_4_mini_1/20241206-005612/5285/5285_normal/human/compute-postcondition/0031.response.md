The value of `b` is divided by `cur`. Since `b` is greater than 1 and `cur` is a positive integer, the value of `b` will decrease but remain positive. The state of `n` and `d_osn[cur]` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now less than its previous value; `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now less than its previous value; `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1.**
