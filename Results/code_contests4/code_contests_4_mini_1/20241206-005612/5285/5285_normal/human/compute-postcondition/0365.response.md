The value of `st` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by itself.

Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by itself**.
