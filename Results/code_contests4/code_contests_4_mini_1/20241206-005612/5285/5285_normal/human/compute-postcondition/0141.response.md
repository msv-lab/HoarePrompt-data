In the provided code, `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The initial value of `newizv` is 1. So, we calculate the new value as follows:

1. Multiply the current value of `newizv` (which is 1) by 2: `1 * 2 = 2`.
2. Add 1 to the result: `2 + 1 = 3`.

The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 3**.
