The variable `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and the value of `newnewk` has not been defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its current value; however, it will be updated based on the multiplication. Therefore, the output state reflects the multiplication operation without a specific value for `newnewk`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is updated by multiplying with `newk`.**
