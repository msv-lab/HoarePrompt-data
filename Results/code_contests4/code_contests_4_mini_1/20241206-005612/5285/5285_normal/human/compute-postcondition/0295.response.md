The value of `st` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `st` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `st` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` resulting in an undefined value.**
