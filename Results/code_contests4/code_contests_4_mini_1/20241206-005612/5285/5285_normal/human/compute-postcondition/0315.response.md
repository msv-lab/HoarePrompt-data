To analyze the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`
- `izv` is equal to `0 + newizv`
- `i` is `st`
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`

The code executes the following line:

```
newn = newn - newk ** st
```

1. The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value.
2. The other variables `izv`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Since we do not have specific values for `newn`, `newk`, or `st`, we can only state the changes generically.

The output state reflects that `newn` has been updated based on the operation performed.

Output State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`, `izv` is equal to `0 + newizv`, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`**
