According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to 1, and `newnewk` remains unchanged after multiplication with `newk`, which is also less than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. Since both `newnewk` and `newn` are currently less than or equal to 1, and to ensure the loop can execute again, at least one of them must be adjusted. 

To ensure `newnewk` can still be less than or equal to `newn`, we can set `newnewk` to be equal to or less than `newn`. Since the current state indicates that both are at their maximum limit (1), we could adjust `newn` to be greater than 1.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 1 and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than 1**
