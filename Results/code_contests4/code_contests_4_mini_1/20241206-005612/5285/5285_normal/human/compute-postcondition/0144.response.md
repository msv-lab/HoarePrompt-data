The loop iterates `st` times, and during each iteration, `newizv` is updated as `newizv * 2 + 1`. Starting from `newizv` being 0, after each iteration, `newizv` follows the sequence: 

- After 1 iteration: `newizv` becomes `0 * 2 + 1 = 1`
- After 2 iterations: `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`
- After 3 iterations: `newizv` becomes `3 * 2 + 1 = 7`

This pattern indicates that after `st` iterations, `newizv` will be equal to `2^st - 1`. Since we also know that `st` is greater than 0 but can be less than or equal to 3 based on the output states given, we can summarize the variable states after all iterations. 

If `st` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `newizv` remains 0. If `st` is greater than 0 and based on the provided output states, `newizv` will be `2^st - 1`, where `st` determines the final value of `newizv`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`.**
