The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is equal to 0, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
