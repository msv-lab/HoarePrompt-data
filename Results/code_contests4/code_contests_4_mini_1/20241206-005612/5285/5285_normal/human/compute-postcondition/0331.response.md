According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, and `newn` is equal to `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared and `newn` is equal to `newk`, it follows that for the loop to execute again, `newk` must be less than or equal to 1 (because if `newk` is greater than 1, `newnewk` will be greater than `newn`).

State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared and for the loop to execute again `newk` must be less than or equal to 1**
