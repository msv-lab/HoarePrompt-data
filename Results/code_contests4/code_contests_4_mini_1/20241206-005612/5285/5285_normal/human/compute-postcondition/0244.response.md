To determine whether the `while` loop can execute based on the given state right before the loop, we need to analyze the condition of the loop:

```
while newnewk <= newn:
```

The loop will execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. 

Looking at the provided state:
- `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
- `st` is 0, which means `newk` raised to the power of `st` equals 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1).
- Therefore, `newn` is less than or equal to 1.
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `newnewk <= newn` holds true. 

Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, we must ensure that `newk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Given that `newn` can be at most 1, for the loop to execute, `newk` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one time are as follows:
- `newk` must be less than or equal to 1.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is now 0; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must be less than or equal to 1**
