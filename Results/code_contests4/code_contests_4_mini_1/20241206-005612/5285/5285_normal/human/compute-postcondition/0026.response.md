Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1. If `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is modified to `b / cur` and `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1. If `b` is not divisible by `cur` and `cur` is 2, then `cur` is set to 3. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 2.***
