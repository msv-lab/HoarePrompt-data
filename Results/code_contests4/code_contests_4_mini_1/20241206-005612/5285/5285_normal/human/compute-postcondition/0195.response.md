`izv` is incremented by `newizv`, and since `newizv` is 0, the value of `izv` remains unchanged at 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than 1 if `newk` is 1.
Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` must be greater than 1 if `newk` is 1.**
