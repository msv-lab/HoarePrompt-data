According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk` after this update.

Thus, we need to ensure that the condition `newn > newk` holds true after the last update. This means we need to adjust the value of `newn` to be greater than `newk` after the update.

State: **`newnewk` is `newk`, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk` after `newn` is updated to newn - newk**
