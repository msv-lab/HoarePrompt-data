The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is equal to 0, `izv` is equal to `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `final value of i` is the initial value of `i` plus `st`, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop.
