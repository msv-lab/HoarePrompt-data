To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition:

The loop can execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `newn` is now equal to `n` (the value of `n` is currently unspecified but is a variable),
- `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` (the value of `newk` is also unspecified).

For the loop to execute:
- `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. 

Currently, the values are:
- `newnewk` (which is `newk`) is unspecified.
- `newn` is equal to `n`, which is also unspecified.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need the condition `newnewk <= newn` to be true. 

1. If `newnewk` (which is `newk`) is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop will run.
2. If `newnewk` equals `newn`, the loop will also run because of the equality.

To guarantee that this condition holds true, we could set `newnewk` to be less than or equal to `newn`. 

Since `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and we have not been given specific values for these variables, we can state that to ensure the loop executes:
- If `newk` (which is `newnewk`) is less than or equal to `n`, then the loop will execute.

Therefore, we can conclude:
State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must be less than or equal to `n`**.
