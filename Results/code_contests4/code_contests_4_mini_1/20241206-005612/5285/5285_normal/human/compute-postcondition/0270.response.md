To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- We know `st` is greater than 0.
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
- `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1`.
- `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`.

For the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`. 

Given that `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, we can conclude that for the loop to run once more, we must ensure that after this update, `newn` still exceeds `newk ** st`. We can express this requirement as:

- The condition `newn - newk > newk ** st` must hold true, which means `newn` must be at least `newk + newk ** st`.

The adjustment needed therefore is to increase `newn` such that it satisfies this condition.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is updated, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be at least `newk + newk ** st`**
