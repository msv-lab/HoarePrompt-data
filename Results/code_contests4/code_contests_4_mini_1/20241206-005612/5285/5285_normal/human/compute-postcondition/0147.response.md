The value of `newn` is assigned a new value calculated by subtracting `newk ** st` from its previous value. The variable `newn` must be greater than `newk`, so the value of `newn` will decrease but should remain positive or maintain its state as long as `newk ** st` is less than `newn`. The values of `newnewk`, `newk`, `st`, and `izv` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` must remain greater than `newk`.**
