The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is 0, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
