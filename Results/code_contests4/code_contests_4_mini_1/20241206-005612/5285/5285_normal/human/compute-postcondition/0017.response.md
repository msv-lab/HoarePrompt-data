The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`; `b` is unchanged; `s` remains 0; `d_osn[cur]` is unchanged; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
