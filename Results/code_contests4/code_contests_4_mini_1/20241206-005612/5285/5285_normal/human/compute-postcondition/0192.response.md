`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 3, so the new value will be calculated as follows: 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 7, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 3.

Output State: **`newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 7, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 3.**
