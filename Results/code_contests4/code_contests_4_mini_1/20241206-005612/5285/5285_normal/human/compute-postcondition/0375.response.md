Postcondition: ***`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, and if `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
