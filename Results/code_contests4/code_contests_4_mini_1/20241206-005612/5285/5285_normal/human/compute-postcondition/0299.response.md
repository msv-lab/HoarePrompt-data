According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `newn` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must still be less than or equal to `newn`.

Since we do not know the values of `newk` and `n`, we cannot guarantee that `newnewk` will be less than or equal to `newn` without additional information. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `newnewk` is still less than or equal to `newn`.

State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
