The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are not stated, but `izv` will now be equal to its previous value plus `newizv`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * (st + 1)`; `izv` is now increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * (st + 1)`; `izv` is now increased by `newizv`.**
