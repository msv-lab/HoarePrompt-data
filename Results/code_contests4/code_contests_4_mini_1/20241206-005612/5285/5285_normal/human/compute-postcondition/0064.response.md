Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` (i.e., `newnewk` is `newk^st`).**
