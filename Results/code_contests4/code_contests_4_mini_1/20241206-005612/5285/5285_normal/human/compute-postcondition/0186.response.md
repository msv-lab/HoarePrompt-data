Postcondition: ***`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, which is 0. `izv`, `mlt`, and `newizv` remain 0. `res` is updated based on `mlt`. `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, and `i` is 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
