The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, we can express this operation as `newn = newn - newnewk`. The other variables, `st` and `izv`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newnewk`, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv` (which is `2^st - 1`), and `newn` must be at least `newk + newk` for the loop to execute again.
