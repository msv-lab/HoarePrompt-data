The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, which means `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`. The value of `newnewk` was previously assigned as `newk * newk`, so after this operation, it becomes `(newk * newk) * newk`, which simplifies to `newk^3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk^3`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk^3`**
