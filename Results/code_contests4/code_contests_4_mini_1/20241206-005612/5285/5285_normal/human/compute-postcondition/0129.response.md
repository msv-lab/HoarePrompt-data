The variable `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. However, the values of `newnewk` and `newk` are not provided in the initial state. Since `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `newn`, it implies that its value is currently not provided, nor is `newk`. The other variables (`newn`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state indicates that the operation occurs without specific values for `newnewk` and `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`; `newn` is less than or equal to 1, `st` is 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0**
