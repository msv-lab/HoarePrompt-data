`st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newk * newk`**
