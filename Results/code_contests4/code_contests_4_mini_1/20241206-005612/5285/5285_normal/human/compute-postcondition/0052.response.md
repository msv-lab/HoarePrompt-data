The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` will be 1. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is an unknown value, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, and `st` is initialized to 0**.
