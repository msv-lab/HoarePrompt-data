The statement `newnewk *= newk` updates the value of `newnewk` by multiplying it with `newk`. However, the values of `newnewk` and `newk` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `newnewk` after execution. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`.

Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is updated based on the multiplication with `newk`.**
