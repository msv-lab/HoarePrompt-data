According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, which implies that `newk` must also be less than `newn` since `newnewk` is a new value that is greater than `newn`. 

Since `i` is equal to `st`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `newn` to be greater than `newk * st`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `newn` is greater than `newk * st` after it has already been decreased by `newk`.

Thus, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk * (st + 1)` to ensure that the loop can execute again.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk * (st + 1)`**.
