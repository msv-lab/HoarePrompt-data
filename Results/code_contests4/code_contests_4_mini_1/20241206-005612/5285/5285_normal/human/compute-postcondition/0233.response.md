The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, but the previous value of `izv` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `izv` after the increment. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated to a value that is `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute again, the initial value of `newn` must be greater than `2 * newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated to a value that is `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute again, the initial value of `newn` must be greater than `2 * newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
