According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, resulting in an undefined value. This means `newnewk` cannot be compared to `newn`, and therefore the loop cannot execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be defined and less than or equal to `newn`. 

State: **`newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be defined and less than or equal to `newn`**
