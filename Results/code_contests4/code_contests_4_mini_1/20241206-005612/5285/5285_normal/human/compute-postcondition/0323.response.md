According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop combined with a condition `i < 10`. This means that the loop will always execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, but since `newn` and `newk` do not affect the execution of the loop based on the provided condition, we focus on the variable `i`. 

Since the loop can execute indefinitely as long as `i` is less than 10, we do not need to adjust any states because, at the end of the previous iteration, there is no information given about the current value of `i`. Hence, we cannot determine if `i` is less than 10. 

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`**
