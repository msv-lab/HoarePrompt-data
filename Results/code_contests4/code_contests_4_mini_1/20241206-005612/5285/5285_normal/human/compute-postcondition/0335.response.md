The variable `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk` cubed prior to this operation, the new value of `newnewk` will be `newk` cubed multiplied by `newk`, which results in `newk` raised to the fourth power. The value of `newk`, however, is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `newnewk` after this operation. The other variables (`newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` to the power of 4, for the loop to execute again `newk` must be less than or equal to 1**
