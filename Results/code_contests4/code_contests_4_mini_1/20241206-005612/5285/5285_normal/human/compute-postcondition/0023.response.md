`cur` is assigned the value 3. The values of the other variables (`n` and `b`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `cur` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is greater than 1; `cur` is 3**
