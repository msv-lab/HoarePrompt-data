Postcondition: ***`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk`, `izv` is updated to reflect the sum of `newizv`, `b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and since `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
