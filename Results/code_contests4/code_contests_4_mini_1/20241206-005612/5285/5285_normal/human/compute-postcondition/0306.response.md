According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute at least once, `st` must be greater than 0. Since `st` is currently noted as the number of iterations where `newnewk` was less than or equal to `newn`, if `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, then `st` could potentially be 0, which would prevent the loop from executing.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `st` is greater than 0. Additionally, since `i` starts at 1 and is the loop counter, it will begin from that value.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we can summarize the necessary adjustments as follows:

State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**.
