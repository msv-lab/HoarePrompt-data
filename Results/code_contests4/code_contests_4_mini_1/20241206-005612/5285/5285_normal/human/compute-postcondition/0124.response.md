The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The initial state indicates that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, but since the value of `newk` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the specific values. However, it is clear that `newnewk` will now hold the value of `newk`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^0`, `st` is 0, and `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^0`, `st` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 0**
