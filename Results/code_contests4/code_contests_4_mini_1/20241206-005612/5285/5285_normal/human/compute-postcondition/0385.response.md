To analyze the impact of the code on the program, we will consider the initial state of the variables:

- `newnewk` is `newk ** st`
- `i` is `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`

Now, the code snippet:
```
newn = newn - newk ** st
```

The code assigns the value of `newn` to be decreased by `newk ** st`. 

Given that `newnewk` is defined as `newk ** st`, we can substitute this into the equation:
```
newn = newn - newnewk
```

This means `newn` is decreased by the value of `newnewk`. The other variables (`i`, `newizv`, `izv`) remain unchanged based on the provided information.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `newn` as well as the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk ** st`, `i` is `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newnewk`**
