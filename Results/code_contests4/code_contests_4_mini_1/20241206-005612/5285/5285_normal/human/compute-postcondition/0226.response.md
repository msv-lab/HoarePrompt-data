According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than `1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be greater than `1`. Since the loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become `2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than `2`.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `st` must be greater than 2**
