The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now modified to `b / cur`; `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
