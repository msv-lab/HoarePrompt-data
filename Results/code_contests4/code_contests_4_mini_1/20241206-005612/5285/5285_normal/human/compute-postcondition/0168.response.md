The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `newk`, and `newn` remain unchanged as `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, and `i` is 0.**
