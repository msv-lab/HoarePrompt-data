According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute a second time if `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by `st`, `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, and `st` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
