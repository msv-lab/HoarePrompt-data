The loop multiplies `newizv` by 2 and adds 1 for each iteration, starting from its initial value of 0. Given that `st` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, the loop will execute `st` times.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will equal `st`, and `newizv` will be updated according to the formula applied `st` times. 

If `st` is 0, the loop does not execute and `newizv` remains 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to (2^st - 1).**
