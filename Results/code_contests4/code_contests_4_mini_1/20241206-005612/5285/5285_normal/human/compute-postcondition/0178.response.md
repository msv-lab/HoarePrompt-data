The variable `newnewk` is updated by multiplying its current value with `newk`. The initial value of `newnewk` is not specified but is updated based on previous calculations, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, which is also not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `newnewk` is updated but does not provide specific numerical values.

Output State: **`izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated by multiplying with `newk`.**
