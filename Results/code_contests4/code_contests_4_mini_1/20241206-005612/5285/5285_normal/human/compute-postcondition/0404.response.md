The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it operates with the constraints that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), and `b` is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^{12}\). 

Since there are no cases described for the output, we can infer the intended functionality based on the provided constraints. The function will likely manipulate or evaluate these parameters in some way to produce a return value.

Functionality: **The function operates with a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and an integer `b` (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12) and will return a value based on these parameters, although the specific return value is not provided.**
