`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 1, so after execution, `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is 1, `izv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `newizv` is 3, `res` is updated based on `mlt`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2.
