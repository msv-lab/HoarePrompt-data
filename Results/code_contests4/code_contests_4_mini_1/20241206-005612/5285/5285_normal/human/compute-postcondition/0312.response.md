The loop is iterating `st` times, and during each iteration, `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. 

From the output states provided:
- After 1 iteration, `newizv` is 1.
- After 2 iterations, `newizv` is 3.
- After 3 iterations, `newizv` is 7.

Following the pattern, we can observe that `newizv` doubles its value and adds 1 during each iteration. Specifically, the results can be summarized as follows:
- After 1 iteration: `newizv` = `1` (which is `2^1 - 1`)
- After 2 iterations: `newizv` = `3` (which is `2^2 - 1`)
- After 3 iterations: `newizv` = `7` (which is `2^3 - 1`)

Thus, after `st` iterations, `newizv` will be `2^st - 1`. 

If `st` is equal to 0, the loop won't execute, and `newizv` will remain at its initial value of 0.

Summarizing the final output state:
- If `st` = 0, `newizv` = 0.
- If `st` > 0, `newizv` = `2^st - 1`.

The other variables (`newn`, `izv`, `i`, and `newnewk`) remain unchanged from their initial states throughout the loop execution.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is `st`, `st` is the number of iterations, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`.**
