According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The loop will continue executing as long as `newn` is greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated to a value of `newn - newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must still be greater than `newk`. 

Since `newn` has been updated to a value that is `newn - newk`, we need to ensure that this updated value is still greater than `newk`. This means that the initial value of `newn` must have been greater than `2 * newk` before the update.

State: **`newn` is updated to a value that is `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute again, the initial value of `newn` must be greater than `2 * newk`**
