Postcondition: ***`newn` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `st` is the number of iterations where `newnewk` was less than or equal to `newn`, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and if `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
