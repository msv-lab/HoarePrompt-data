Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is updated based on the total contributions from each iteration, `i` is 10, `st` is determined by the last valid computation before breaking, `newizv` corresponds to the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`. If `res` is equal to -1, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`.***
