The variable `s` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables `n` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0**
