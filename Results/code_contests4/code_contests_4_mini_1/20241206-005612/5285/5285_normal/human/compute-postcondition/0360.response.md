The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `1`.
