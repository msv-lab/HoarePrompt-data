The value of `newizv` is updated by the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Given that `newizv` is initially 3, we calculate the new value: 

`newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`.

The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `newizv` is 7.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is less than or equal to `1`, `st` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `newizv` is 7**.
