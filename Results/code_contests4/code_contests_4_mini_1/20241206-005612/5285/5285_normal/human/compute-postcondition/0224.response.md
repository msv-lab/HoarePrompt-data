According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1. For the loop to continue executing, `st` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 0 and increments).

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
