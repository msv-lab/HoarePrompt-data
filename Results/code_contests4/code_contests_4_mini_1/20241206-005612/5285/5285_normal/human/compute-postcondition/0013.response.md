The value of `cur` is incremented by 2. Since `cur` is not equal to 2 initially and the condition `b % 2 ≠ 0` indicates that `b` is an odd integer, there are no constraints on the new value of `cur` related to `b`. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, but it will be increased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int; `cur` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^12; `s` is 0; `d_osn` is a defaultdict of int; `cur` is increased by 2.**
