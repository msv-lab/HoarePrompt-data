The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The value of `newk ** st` represents `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `newn` is initially greater than `newk * (st + 1)`, the calculation will result in a new value for `newn`. The other variables, `st`, `i`, and `izv`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `st`, `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
