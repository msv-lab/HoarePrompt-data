The line of code `newnewk *= newk` updates the value of `newnewk` by multiplying it with `newk`. The initial state indicates that `newnewk` is being updated, but does not specify its initial value. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `newnewk` without knowing `newk`. The other variables (`newizv`, `izv`, `st`, and `i`) remain unchanged after this operation. 

The output state reflects that `newnewk` is updated, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is 2; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
