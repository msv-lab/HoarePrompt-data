The variable `st` is assigned the value `0`, which sets its value without affecting any other variables. The previous values of the affected variables (`newn`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newk`) remain unchanged as they are not influenced by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is now equal to `n`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, `st` is 0, `newizv` corresponds to the last calculated value of `2^st - 1`, and `newk` is assigned the value of `k`.
