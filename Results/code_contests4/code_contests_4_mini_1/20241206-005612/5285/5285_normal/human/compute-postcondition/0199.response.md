The code assigns a new value to `newn` by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its previous value. The initial value of `newk` is 1, but we do not have the initial value of `newn` or `st`. Therefore, the specific impact on `newn` cannot be quantified without knowing `newn` and `st`. 

The output state will indicate that `newn` has been modified, but without specific values, we cannot determine the exact new value. Therefore, the output state is: 

Output State: **`newn` is updated based on the subtraction of `newk ** st`, where `newk` is 1 and `st` is an unknown value.**
