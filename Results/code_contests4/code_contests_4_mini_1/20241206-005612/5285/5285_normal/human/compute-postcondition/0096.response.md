According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`, which means `newnewk` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to 1 as well, since `newn` is less than or equal to 1.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to 1, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again; `newk` remains unchanged; `st` is increased by 1**
