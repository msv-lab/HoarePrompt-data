The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` multiplied by `st` from its current value. The variable `izv` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `newn`, while `izv` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk * st`, `izv` remains unchanged**
