The variable `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after the execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is equal to the initial value of `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed; `st` is now 1; variable `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`.
