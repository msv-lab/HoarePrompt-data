The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables; it simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, while `n`, `b`, and `d_osn[cur]` retain their previous states, the execution flow is altered by skipping the rest of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `b` is now less than its previous value; `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
