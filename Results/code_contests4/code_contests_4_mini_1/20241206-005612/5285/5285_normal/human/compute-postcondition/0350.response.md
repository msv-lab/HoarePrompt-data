The value of `newn` is decremented by `newk ** st`. The value of `st` can be either 0 or 1. If `st` is 0, then `newk ** st` is 1, so `newn` will be decreased by 1. If `st` is 1, then `newk ** st` is `newk`, so `newn` will be decreased by `newk`. The initial state indicates that `newn` is equal to `newk`, which means in the case of `st` being 0, `newn` will be `newk - 1`, and in the case of `st` being 1, `newn` will be `0`. Therefore, the Output State will reflect both possibilities for `st`.

Output State: **`newn` is either `newk - 1` or `0`; `st` is 0 or 1; `i` is equal to `st - 1`; `newk` is greater than 1; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
