The value of `newizv` is updated with the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation results in `0 * 2 + 1`, which equals 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `newizv` is 1; `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1**
