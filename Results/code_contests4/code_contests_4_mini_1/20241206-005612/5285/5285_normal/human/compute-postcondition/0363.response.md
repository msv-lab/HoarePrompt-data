According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`. For the loop to execute for the first time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`, which implies that `newk` must be less than or equal to the value of `newn`. 

Since `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk^st`, we need to ensure that `newnewk` (which is equal to `newk`) is also less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `newk` must be adjusted such that it is less than or equal to `newn`.

State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, for the loop to execute the first time then `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn` (where `newnewk` is equal to `newk`)**
