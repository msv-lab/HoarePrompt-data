Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `b` is greater than 1. If `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is decreased, `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `b` is not divisible by `cur`, then `cur` is set to 3 if it equals 2, otherwise, `cur` is increased by 2.***
