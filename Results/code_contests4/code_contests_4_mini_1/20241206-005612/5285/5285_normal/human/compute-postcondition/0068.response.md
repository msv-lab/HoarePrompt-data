According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will only execute if `st` is greater than 0. Currently, `st` is equal to 0, which means the loop will not run, and the execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

To ensure that the loop can execute, `st` must be greater than 0. Additionally, since `i` is initialized to 1, it will be adjusted to 0 at the start of the loop for the first iteration.

State: **`b` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `izv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` for the loop to execute the first time**
