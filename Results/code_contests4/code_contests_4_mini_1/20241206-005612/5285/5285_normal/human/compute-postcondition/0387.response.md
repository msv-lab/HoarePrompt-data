The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are not specified, but `izv` will now hold a new value that is the sum of its previous value and `newizv`. Since the condition for the loop to execute again is that `newn` must be greater than `newk`, and the states of `newk` and `newn` are not affected, the output state reflects the updated value of `izv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk`, `izv` is updated by adding `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`.**
