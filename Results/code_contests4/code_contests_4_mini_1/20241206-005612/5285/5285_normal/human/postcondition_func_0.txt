The function accepts two integers, `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), and calculates the minimum value of `mlt`, which is derived from the prime factorization of `b` and the powers of these factors that fit into `n`. It does this by counting the occurrences of each prime factor of `b`, determining how many times each factor can contribute to the powers of `n`, and outputs this minimum value. If `b` ends up being greater than 2 after factorization, it also counts that factor. The function does not return a value explicitly; instead, it prints the result.
