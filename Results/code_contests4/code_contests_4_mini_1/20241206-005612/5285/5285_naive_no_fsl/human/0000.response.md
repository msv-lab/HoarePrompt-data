Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of trailing zeros in the base `b` representation of `n!` for all potential cases. 

One specific case that illustrates the problem is when `n` is a prime number and `b` is a multiple of that prime number. The program's logic for counting trailing zeros is flawed, particularly in how it breaks down the base `b` into its prime factors and subsequently calculates the trailing zeros. 

For example, consider the input:

```
n = 13
b = 39
```

In this case, the prime factorization of `39` is `3 * 13`. The program should determine how many times `13!` can be divided by `39` (or `3` and `13` separately) to find the minimum count of trailing zeros. However, the implementation does not correctly handle this case, specifically when `b` is a product of primes that includes `n` itself, leading to an incorrect count of trailing zeros.

Since the program does not provide the correct result for this case, it is deemed incorrect overall.
