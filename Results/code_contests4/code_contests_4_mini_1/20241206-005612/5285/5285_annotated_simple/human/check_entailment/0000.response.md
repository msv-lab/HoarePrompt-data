Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The task is to calculate the number of trailing zeros in the base `b` representation of `n!` (the factorial of `n`). 

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This means it won't run correctly in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Factorial Calculation**: The program does not compute `n!` efficiently. Given that `n` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), directly computing the factorial is not feasible due to its massive size.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: The calculation of trailing zeros in base `b` representation of `n!` should involve finding how many times the prime factors of `b` divide into `n!`. The method used for counting powers of the primes is incorrect and overly complicated. Typically, we need to consider the contributions of each prime factor of `b` to count how many complete sets of those factors can be formed from the factors of `n!`.

4. **Logic Errors**: The loops and logic inside the function do not correctly follow the mathematical principles needed to determine the trailing zeros based on the prime factorization of `b` and the contributions from `n!`. 

For example, to find the trailing zeros, you would typically:
- Factor `b` into its prime factors.
- For each prime factor, count how many times it can be obtained from the multiples of that factor in `n!` using Legendre's formula.
- The number of trailing zeros in base `b` would be the minimum of the counts divided by their respective powers in the factorization of `b`.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description and would fail for various inputs.
