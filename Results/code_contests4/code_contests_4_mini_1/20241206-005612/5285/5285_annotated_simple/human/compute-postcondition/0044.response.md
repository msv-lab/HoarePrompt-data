The variable `res` is assigned the value of -1. No other variables are affected by this operation, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is 1, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of the initial value of `b`, `d_osn` contains the prime factorization counts of the original value of `b` with respect to its prime factors, `izv` is a defaultdict of int, and `res` is -1.
