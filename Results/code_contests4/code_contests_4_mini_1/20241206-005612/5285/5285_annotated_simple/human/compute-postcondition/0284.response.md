The variable `izv` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `izv` is not specified, but since it is being explicitly set to `0`, we can conclude that `izv` now holds the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is 0; `i` is the total number of iterations executed plus 1; `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than or equal to 0; `mlt` is assigned the updated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is 0; `i` is the total number of iterations executed plus 1; `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than or equal to 0; `mlt` is assigned the updated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`.**
