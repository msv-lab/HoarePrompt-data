The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is less than 10, so it can be any value from 0 to 9. Therefore, after execution, `i` will be between 1 and 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0**
