The value of `newizv` is updated by multiplying it by 2 and then adding 1. Since `newizv` is initially 0, the calculation results in `newizv = 0 * 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `newizv = 0 + 1`. Thus, after execution, `newizv` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1**
