The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, and it must be less than 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `st` is now 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `st` is now 0.**
