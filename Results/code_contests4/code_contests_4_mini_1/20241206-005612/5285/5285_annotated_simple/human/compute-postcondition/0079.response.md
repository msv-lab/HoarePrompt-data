`izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The values of `newn`, `n`, and `newk` are not directly affected by this operation, but we know that `newn` is `n - k` and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `newk + k`. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the previous values of the variables while indicating the increment of `izv`. 

Output State: **`newn` is `n - k`, `n` must be greater than `newk + k`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
