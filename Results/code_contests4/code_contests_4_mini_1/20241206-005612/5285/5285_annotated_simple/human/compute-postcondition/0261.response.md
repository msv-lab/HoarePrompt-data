According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2**
