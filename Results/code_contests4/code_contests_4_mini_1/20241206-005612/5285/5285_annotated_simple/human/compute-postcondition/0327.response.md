The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, but the values of `newk` and `newnewk` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` without changing any other variables.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.**
