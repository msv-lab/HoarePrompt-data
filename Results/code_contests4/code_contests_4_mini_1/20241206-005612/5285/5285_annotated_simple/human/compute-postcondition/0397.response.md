Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values calculated during each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` is 10, `st` is at least 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, otherwise `newizv` is 0; `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, and `res` is not equal to -1.***
