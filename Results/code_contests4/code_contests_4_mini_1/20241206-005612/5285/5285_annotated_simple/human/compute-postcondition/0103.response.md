According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is greater than 0. The provided state indicates that `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by itself `st` times, which allows for the condition to potentially be met, but it does not directly affect the execution of the loop.

At the start of the loop, if `st` is equal to 0, then the loop will not execute, and `i` would be increased by `st` (which would not change `i`), `newizv` would remain 0, and `newnewk` would be equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `st` needs to be greater than 0. If `st` is greater than 0, `i` would start at 0, and the loop could iterate up to `st - 1`.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute the first time `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
