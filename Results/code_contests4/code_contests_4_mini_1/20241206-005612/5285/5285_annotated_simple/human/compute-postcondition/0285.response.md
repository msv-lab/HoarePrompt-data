The line `newk = k` assigns the value of `k` to `newk`. However, since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `newk`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is 0; `i` is the total number of iterations executed plus 1; `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than or equal to 0; `mlt` is assigned the updated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`; `newk` is equal to `k`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`; `izv` is 0; `i` is the total number of iterations executed plus 1; `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than or equal to 0; `mlt` is assigned the updated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`; `newk` is equal to `k`.**
