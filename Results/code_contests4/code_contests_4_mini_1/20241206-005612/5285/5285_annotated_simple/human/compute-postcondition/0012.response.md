Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cur` is 2, and `cur` is not equal to 2 (i.e., `cur` is any value other than 2). Additionally, `b` is not divisible by `cur` (i.e., `b % cur != 0`).***
