`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The value of `newk` is not explicitly stated, but it remains unchanged. The other variables (`newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
