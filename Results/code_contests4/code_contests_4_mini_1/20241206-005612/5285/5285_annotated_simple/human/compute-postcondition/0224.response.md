According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `st - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
