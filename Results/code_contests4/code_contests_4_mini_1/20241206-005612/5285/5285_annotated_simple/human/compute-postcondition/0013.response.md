`cur` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `cur` is not specified but is known to be any value other than 2. Since `cur` is being updated, it will take on a new value, which is the previous value plus 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cur` is the previous value plus 2, and `cur` is not equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cur` is the previous value plus 2, and `cur` is not equal to 2.**
