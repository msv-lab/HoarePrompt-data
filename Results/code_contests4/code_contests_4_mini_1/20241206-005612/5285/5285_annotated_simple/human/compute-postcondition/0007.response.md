The variable `b` is divided by `cur`, which is 2. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be `b / 2`. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `b`, while `n` and `s` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is now b / 2, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is now incremented by 1, `cur` is 2**
