According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. For the loop to execute, `st` must be greater than 0. If `st` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `newnewk` will not exceed `newn`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed at least once, `st` needs to be greater than 0. Additionally, before the first execution of the loop, `i` is 0, which is correct since it represents the starting index of the loop.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` remains 0**
