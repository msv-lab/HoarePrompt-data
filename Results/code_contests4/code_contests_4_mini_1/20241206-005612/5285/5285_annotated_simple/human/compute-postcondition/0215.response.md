According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, and the loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be at least equal to `newnewk`, which is `newk` squared.

State: **`newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 2, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk` squared**
