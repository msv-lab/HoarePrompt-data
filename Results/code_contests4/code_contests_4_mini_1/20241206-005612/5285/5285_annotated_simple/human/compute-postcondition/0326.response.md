The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `i`, and `st`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `i` is increased by 1.**
