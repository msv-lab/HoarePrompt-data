According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. Since `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `st`, which it will be as long as `st` is greater than 1.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by itself `st` times, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
