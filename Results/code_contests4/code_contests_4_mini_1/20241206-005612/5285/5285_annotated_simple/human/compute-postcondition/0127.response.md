The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newnewk * newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newnewk * newk`**
