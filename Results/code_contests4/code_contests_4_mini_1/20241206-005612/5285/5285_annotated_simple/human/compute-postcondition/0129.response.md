The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, the multiplication of `newnewk` by `newk` will affect its value, but without specific values for `newnewk` and `newk`, we can only express the relationship. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
