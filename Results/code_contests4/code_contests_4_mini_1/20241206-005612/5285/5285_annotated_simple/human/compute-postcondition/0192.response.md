The variable `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `newizv`, but it implies that it will be modified based on its previous value. The output state reflects that `newizv` is updated according to the formula provided, while other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1.**
