The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is now b / 2, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is now incremented by 1, `cur` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
