The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`, `st` is 0, and `newizv` is 0. 

Output State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0**
