According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop can execute if `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `newn` is equal to `n`
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is 0
- `newizv` remains unchanged from its initial value

Since `st` is 0, the condition `newk * st` evaluates to 0, which means the loop condition simplifies to `newn > 0`. 

Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, `newn` must be greater than 0.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `newn` must be greater than 0**
