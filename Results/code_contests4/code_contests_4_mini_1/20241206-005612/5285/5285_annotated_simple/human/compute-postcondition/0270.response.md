According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk`. 

Since `newn` is decreased by `newk`, for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be adjusted such that `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. Therefore, `newn` needs to be adjusted to ensure that after decreasing by `newk`, it still remains greater than `newk * st`.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk * st` after being decreased by `newk`**
