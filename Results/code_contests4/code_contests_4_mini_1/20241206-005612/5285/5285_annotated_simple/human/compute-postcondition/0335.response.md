The variable `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, which means that the value of `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`. The values of `newn` and `newk` are not directly affected by this operation, but it's important to note that `newn` is still greater than `newk^2` and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk^3`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `newnewk`. 

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^2`; for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk^3`; `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`.**
