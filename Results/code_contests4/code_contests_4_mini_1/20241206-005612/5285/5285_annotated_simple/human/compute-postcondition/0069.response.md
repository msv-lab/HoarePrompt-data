The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not specified, but it is initialized to 0. Therefore, calculating the new value results in `newizv` being updated to `0 * 2 + 1`, which equals 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `k` raised to the power of `st`, `b` is greater than 1, `d_osn` contains at least one prime factor, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `izv` is initialized to 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 0, `newnewk` exceeds `newn` at the end of the loop, and `newizv` is 1**.
