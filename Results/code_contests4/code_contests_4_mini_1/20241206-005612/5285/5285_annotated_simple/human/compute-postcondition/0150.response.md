The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Given that `newk` is `1`, the calculation simplifies since `1 ** st` is always `1` regardless of the value of `st`. Therefore, `newn` will be decreased by `1`. The variable `newn` is initially greater than `1`, and it is updated to be less than its previous value. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than 1 and is decreased by 1; `i` is between 1 and 10; `st` is greater than or equal to 0; `newizv` is `2^st - 1`; `newnewk` is equal to 1; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than 1 and is decreased by 1; `i` is between 1 and 10; `st` is greater than or equal to 0; `newizv` is `2^st - 1`; `newnewk` is equal to 1; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
