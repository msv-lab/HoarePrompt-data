The value of `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. Given that `st` is 0, the expression `newk ** st` evaluates to 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, `newn` is updated to `newn - 1`. The value of `newk` is greater than `newn`, but that does not affect the calculation of `newn` in this case. The other variables (`newizv` and `izv`) are not affected by this operation. 

The Output State reflects the updated value of `newn`. Thus, we state that `newn` has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**.
