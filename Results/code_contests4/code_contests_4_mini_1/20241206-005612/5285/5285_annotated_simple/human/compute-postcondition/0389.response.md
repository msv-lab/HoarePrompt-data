To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` condition: `newn > newk ** st`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is 0
- `i` is -1
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`
- `newn` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again
- `newn` is unchanged as `newn - newk`

Given that `st` is 0, the expression `newk ** st` evaluates to 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, the condition simplifies to checking if `newn > 1`.

Currently, since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and knowing that `newn` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be adjusted to ensure that `newn` is greater than 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` should be at least 2 or greater, which is already implied since it must also be at least 3 based on the conditions provided.

Thus, the required adjustment is that `newn` must be at least 3.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be at least 3**
