The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `b`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), and the parameter `b` is a positive integer representing the base, constrained to (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12). After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is not specified in detail, but it is implied that the function will process `n` and `b` in some manner related to their mathematical properties. However, based on the provided information, we can summarize the functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and b, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and b is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12).**
