The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, but the value of `newk` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, `newnewk` becomes `newnewk * newk`, which means the value of `newnewk` is now dependent on the value of `newk`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `newnewk * newk`**
