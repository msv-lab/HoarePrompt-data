The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Given that `st` is the number of iterations executed and `newk` is less than `newn`, `newk ** st` will be a positive value. Therefore, after execution, `newn` will be decreased by this amount. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is the number of iterations executed; `i` is `st - 1`; `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is the number of iterations executed; `i` is `st - 1`; `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
