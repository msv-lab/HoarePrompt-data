The variable `newizv` is updated to the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not specified, but it is affected by the operation. The other variables `newn`, `newk`, `i`, and `st` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`; `i` is 1; `st` is at least 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`; `i` is 1; `st` is at least 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1.**
