The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk^2` before this operation, the new value of `newnewk` will be `newk^2 * newk`, which simplifies to `newk^3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `newn` is greater than `newk^2`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^2`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`**
