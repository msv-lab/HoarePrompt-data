`st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, the new value of `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk`**.
