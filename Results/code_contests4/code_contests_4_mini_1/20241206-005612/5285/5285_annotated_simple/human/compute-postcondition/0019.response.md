According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is still greater than 1, so the loop can execute again without any adjustments. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`**
