The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown, so the output state is: `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and `st` is increased by 1**
