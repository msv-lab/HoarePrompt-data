The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Since `newn` is greater than `newk`, the result after this operation will still be a positive value, but the exact value of `newn` after the operation is not specified. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`, `newk` remains unchanged, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk ** st`, `newk` remains unchanged, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
