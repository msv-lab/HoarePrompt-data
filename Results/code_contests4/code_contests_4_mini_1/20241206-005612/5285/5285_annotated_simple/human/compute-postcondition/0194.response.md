To determine whether the `while` loop can execute at least once, we must analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

Given:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is the number of iterations executed
- `i` is `st - 1`
- `newizv` is updated `st` times according to the formula `newizv * 2 + 1`

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, we can infer that `newk` must also be adjusted. 

The condition for the loop to execute is:
1. `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`.

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this means `newk` must be adjusted such that `newk ** st` becomes less than `newn`, allowing the loop to proceed.

Thus, we could consider the following adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `newk` is sufficiently small or `st` is decreased, so that `newk ** st` is less than `newn`.

Since `newk` is currently not specified but is implied to be less than `newnewk`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute:
- `newk` should be adjusted such that `newk ** st < newn`. 

Therefore, the adjusted state must reflect this requirement.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `i` is `st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must satisfy `newk ** st < newn`**
