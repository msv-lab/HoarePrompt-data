The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Since `st` is 0, `newk ** st` equals 1 (any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, `newn` is decreased by 1. The values of `newnewk`, `st`, and `izv` remain unchanged, and `izv` has already been increased by `newizv`. 

Thus, the output state is: `newn` is equal to `n - 2`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n - 2`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**.
