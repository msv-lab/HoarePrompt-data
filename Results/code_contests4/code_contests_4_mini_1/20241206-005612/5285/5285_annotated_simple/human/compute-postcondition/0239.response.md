According to the code, the loop will continue executing indefinitely due to the `while True` condition. The additional condition `i < 10` means that as long as `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute one more time. However, since we're not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we cannot determine if `i` is currently less than 10.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than 10. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` is less than 10. 

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 10**
