The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Given that the initial value of `newizv` is 3, we can calculate the new value as follows:

newizv = 3 * 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7.

The states of the other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 7.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 7**.
