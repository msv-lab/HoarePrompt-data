According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `st` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 2. Additionally, since `st` is greater than 1, it must also be true that `st` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`**
