The value of `izv` is assigned to 0, which means it is reset to zero. The previous value of `izv` (which was accumulated based on the prime factorization involving `newk`) is replaced by 0. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `i`, and `mlt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`, where `d_osn` must have at least `j + 2` elements.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`, where `d_osn` must have at least `j + 2` elements.**
