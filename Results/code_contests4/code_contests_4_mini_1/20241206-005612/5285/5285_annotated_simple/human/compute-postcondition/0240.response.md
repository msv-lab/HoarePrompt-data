The variable `st` is assigned the value 0. The values of `newn`, `newk`, `izv`, and `newizv` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The condition for the loop to execute again is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, `i` must be less than 10, and `st` is now 0.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, `i` must be less than 10, and `st` is now 0.**
