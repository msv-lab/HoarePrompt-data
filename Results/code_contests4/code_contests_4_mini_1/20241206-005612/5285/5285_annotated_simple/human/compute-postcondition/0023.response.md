The value of `cur` is assigned the value `3`. The previous value of `cur` is not specified, but it is stated that it was greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. The values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `cur` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `cur` is 3**
