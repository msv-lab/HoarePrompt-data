The loop executes `st` times, updating `newizv` each time with the expression `newizv * 2 + 1`. The variable `newnewk` remains greater than `newn`, and `st` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. 

After all iterations of the loop have finished executing, `newizv` will have been updated `st` times according to the rule of doubling and adding one. 

If `st` is greater than 0, `i` will be `st - 1` after the final iteration, as it starts from 0 and counts up to `st - 1`. 

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations completed, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2^st + (2^st - 1)`**.
