`newn` is assigned the value of `n`. The variable `newn` is affected, but the previous value of `n` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 10, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`.**
