Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. If `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes occur.***
