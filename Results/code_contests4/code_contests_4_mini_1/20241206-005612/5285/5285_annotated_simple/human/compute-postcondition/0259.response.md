According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1.

Thus, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `newizv` is assigned the value `newizv * 2 + 1`**
