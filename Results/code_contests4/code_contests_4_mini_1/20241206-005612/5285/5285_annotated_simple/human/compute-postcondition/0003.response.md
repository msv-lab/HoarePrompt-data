`cur` is assigned the value 2, and this does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, and `cur` is 2. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cur` is 2**
