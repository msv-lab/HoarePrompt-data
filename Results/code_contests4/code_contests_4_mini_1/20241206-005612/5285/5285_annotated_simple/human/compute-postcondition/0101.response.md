The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk` multiplied by `newk` multiplied by ... (st times), `st` is equal to 0, `i` is increased by `st`, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
