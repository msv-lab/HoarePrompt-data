To analyze the output state after all iterations of the while loop have executed, let's summarize the behavior based on the code and the initial state provided.

**Initial State:** 
- `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`
- `i` is between 1 and 10
- `st` is greater than or equal to 0
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1`
- `newnewk` is equal to 1

**Code of the loop:**
```
while newn > newk ** st:
    izv += newizv
    newn = newn - newk ** st
```

1. **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`. 
2. **Loop Execution:** Each iteration decreases `newn` by the value of `newk ** st` and increases `izv` by `newizv`.

The loop will execute as long as the condition is met. We need to consider what happens after it has finished executing:

- Once the loop condition fails, we know `newn` is no longer greater than `newk ** st`, meaning `newn` has been decreased to a value that is less than or equal to `newk ** st`.
- `izv` has accumulated the value of `newizv` for each iteration executed, which can be expressed as `izv` being increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed.

Given that `newn` starts greater than or equal to `newnewk` and the loop decreases `newn` in steps of `newk ** st`, once the loop finishes:

- If `newn` was initially greater than `newk ** st`, it will be decreased to a value less than or equal to `newk ** st`.
- The final value of `newn` will be `newn - x * (newk ** st)` for some integer `x`, where `x` is the number of times the loop executed until the condition was no longer satisfied.
- `izv` will be increased by `newizv` for each of those iterations.

**Output State:** 
After all iterations have executed, we have:
- `newn` is less than or equal to `newk ** st` (the exact value depends on initial conditions).
- `i` remains between 1 and 10.
- `st` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- `newizv` is still `2^st - 1`.
- `newnewk` is still equal to 1.
- `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of iterations executed.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk ** st`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is equal to 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of loop executions.**
