According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the loop control variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 1. After the next execution of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`newnewk` is `k` raised to the power of `st`, `b` is greater than 1, `d_osn` contains at least one prime factor, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `izv` is initialized to 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 1**
