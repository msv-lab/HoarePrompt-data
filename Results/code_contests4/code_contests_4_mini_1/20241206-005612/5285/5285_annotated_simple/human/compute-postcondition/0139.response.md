`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is 0, so after execution, `newizv` becomes 0 * 2 + 1 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, and `newnewk` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to 1**
