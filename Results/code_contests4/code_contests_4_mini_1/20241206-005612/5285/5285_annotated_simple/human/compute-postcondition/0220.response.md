The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is 0, `i` remains 0, `newizv` remains 0, and `newnewk` does not exceed `newn` since `st` is the maximum number of iterations until it does so, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
