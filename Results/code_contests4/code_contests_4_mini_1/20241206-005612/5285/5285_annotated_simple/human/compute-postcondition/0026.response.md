Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. If `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is less than or equal to `sqrt(b)` and `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1. If `b` is not divisible by `cur` and `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is set to 3; otherwise, `cur` is increased by 2.***
