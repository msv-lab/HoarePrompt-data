According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 3**
