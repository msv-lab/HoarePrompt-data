The value of `newn` is decreased by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` is greater than or equal to 0, the result of `newk ** st` will be a non-negative value, and `newn` will be reduced accordingly. The exact new value of `newn` cannot be determined without specific values for `newn`, `newk`, and `st`, but it will be less than the original value of `newn`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
