`st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value was 1, the new value of `st` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is greater than 1, `d_osn` must contain at least one prime factor for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `izv` is initialized to 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is now `k * k * k`.
