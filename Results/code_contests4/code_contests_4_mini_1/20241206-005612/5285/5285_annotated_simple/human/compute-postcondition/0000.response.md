The code assigns values to `n` and `b` from a space-separated input string. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), after execution `n` and `b` will hold the values provided from the input, but we do not know their specific values since they are taken from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `b` are now defined based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12)**
