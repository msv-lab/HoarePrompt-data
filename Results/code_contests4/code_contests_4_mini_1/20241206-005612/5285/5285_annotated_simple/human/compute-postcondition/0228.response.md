The loop increments `newizv` by multiplying it by 2 and adding 1 in each iteration. Given that the loop executes `st` times, the pattern of `newizv` indicates that it follows the formula \(newizv = 2^i - 1\) after `i` iterations, starting from 0. 

If `st` is greater than 0, after all iterations are completed, `i` will equal `st - 1`, and `newizv` will be \(2^{st} - 1\). If `st` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `newizv` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0 or -1 if `st` is 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0 or 0 if `st` is 0.**
