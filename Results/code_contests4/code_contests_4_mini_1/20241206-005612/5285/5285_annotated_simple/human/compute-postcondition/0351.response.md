According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. For the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been decreased by `newk`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `newk`. 

Since `newn` has already been decreased, it must currently be greater than `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, we can state that `newn` must have been originally greater than `newk + newk`. 

State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`**
