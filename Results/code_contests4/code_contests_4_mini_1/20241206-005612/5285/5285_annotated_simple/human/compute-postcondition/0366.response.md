According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `newnewk` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn` after being increased by 1. This means that `newn` must be at least equal to the current value of `newnewk` after the increment. 

Assuming `newnewk` was `k` before the increment, for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be at least `k + 1`.

State: **variable `st` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again, newn must be greater than or equal to newnewk after the increment**
