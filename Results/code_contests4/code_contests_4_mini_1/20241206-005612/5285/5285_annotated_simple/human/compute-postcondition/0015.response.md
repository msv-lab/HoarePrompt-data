Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12). If `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is halved, `s` remains 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1, and `cur` remains 2. If `b` is not divisible by `cur`, `cur` is updated to 3 if it was 2, or incremented by 2 if it was greater than 2, while `b` remains unchanged.***
