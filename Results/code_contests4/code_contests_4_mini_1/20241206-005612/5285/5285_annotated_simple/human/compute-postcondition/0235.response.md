According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. For the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk ** st`**
