To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, we note that `newn` is being decremented by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The value of `newk` is not provided, and we do not know the previous value of `newn`. 

Since `st` is involved in the calculation:
- If `st > 0`, then `newn` will be decreased by `newk` raised to a positive power, which will affect `newn`.
- If `st = 0`, then `newn` will not be affected as `newk ** 0` equals 1, making the operation effectively `newn = newn - newk ** 0` which simplifies to `newn = newn - 1`.

However, we cannot determine the exact values of `newn` or `newk`, so we cannot specify the exact changes. Therefore, the output state will reflect the conditions under which the changes happen but not specify exact values.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`, where `st` can be either greater than 0 or equal to 0 affecting the decrement of `newn`.**
