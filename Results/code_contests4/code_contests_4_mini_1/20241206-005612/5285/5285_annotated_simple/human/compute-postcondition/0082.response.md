The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The values of `newn` and `newk` are not directly affected by this operation, but it's noted that `newn` must still be greater than `newk` for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is decreased by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
