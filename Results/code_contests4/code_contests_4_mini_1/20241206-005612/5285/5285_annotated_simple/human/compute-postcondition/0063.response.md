The value of `st` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `st` is 2, after execution, `st` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is greater than 1, `d_osn` must contain at least one prime factor for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `izv` is initialized to 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.
