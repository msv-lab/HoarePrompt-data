The code assigns a new value to `newn`, calculated as `newn - newk ** st`. Since `st` is 0, `newk ** st` equals 1 (any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). The impact of this code is that `newn` will be decreased by 1. The values of `newnewk`, `i`, and `izv` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1, `newn` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1, `newn` is decreased by 1.**
