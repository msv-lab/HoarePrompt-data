According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both conditions in the `while` statement are satisfied: `True` (which is always true) and `i < 10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `st - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 10. This means that `st` must be at least 10; therefore, `st` must be adjusted to ensure that `i` becomes 9 or less.

Currently, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, but these values do not directly influence the ability of the loop to execute again since the loop's execution relies solely on the value of `i`.

To summarize, `st` is currently less than 10, and needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is at least 10, `i` is `st - 1`**.
