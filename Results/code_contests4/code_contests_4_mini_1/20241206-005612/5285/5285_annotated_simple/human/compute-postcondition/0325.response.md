The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is less than 10, so after execution, `i` will be at least 1 and less than or equal to 10. The values of `newn` and `st` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, and `i` is increased by 1**.
