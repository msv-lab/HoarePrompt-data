The value of `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is initially equal to `newk multiplied by newk`, the new value of `newnewk` after this operation will be `newk multiplied by newk multiplied by newk`. The previous values of `newn`, `st`, `i`, and `newizv` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 2; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk multiplied by newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 2; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk multiplied by newk.**
