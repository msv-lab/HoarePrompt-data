According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as the condition `True and i < 10` is satisfied. The `True` part of the condition will always be true, so the only condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute is `i < 10`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which is less than 10. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to any of the states for the loop to execute at least once. 

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`; `izv` is 0; `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is greater than or equal to 0; `mlt` is assigned the updated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`; `newk` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0**
