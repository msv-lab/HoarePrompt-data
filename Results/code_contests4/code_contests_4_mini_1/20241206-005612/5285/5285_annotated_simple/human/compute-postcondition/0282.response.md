Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is equal to the initial `izv` plus the product of `newizv` and the total number of iterations executed, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations executed (which is at most 10), `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`, and `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res` while retaining the existing conditions.***
