To analyze the given code snippet, we consider the initial states of `newn`, `newk`, and `st`, and how they impact the execution of the code.

1. The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting the product of `newk` and `st` from it. 
2. The values of `newk` and `st` are needed to determine how much `newn` decreases.
3. The variable `izv` is not affected by this operation.

Since we do not have the specific values for `newn`, `newk`, and `st`, we cannot compute an exact numerical result. However, we can describe the changes in terms of their relationships.

Thus, the Output State will reflect the change in `newn` and the fact that `izv` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk` ** `st`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
