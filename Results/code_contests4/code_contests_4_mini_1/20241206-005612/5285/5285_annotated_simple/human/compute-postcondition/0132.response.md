Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` which affects its value, allowing the loop to potentially execute again if `newn` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `newnewk` after multiplication.**
