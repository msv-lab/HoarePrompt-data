`st` is incremented by 1, so its previous value of 1 becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 2, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 2; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk`; and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`.**
