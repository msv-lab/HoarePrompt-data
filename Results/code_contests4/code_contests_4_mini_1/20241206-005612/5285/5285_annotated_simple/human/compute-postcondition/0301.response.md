The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is not specified, but it is known that it is increased. Other variables (`newn`, `newnewk`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk * newk`, and `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk * newk`, and `st` is increased by 1**
