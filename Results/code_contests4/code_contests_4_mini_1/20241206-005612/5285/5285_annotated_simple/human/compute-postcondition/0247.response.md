According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is updated to a value that is still less than or equal to `newn`, and `st` is incremented by 1, which does not affect the loop condition.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newnewk` must remain less than or equal to `newn`. No adjustments are necessary for `newn` since the condition requires `newnewk` to be less than or equal to it.

State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and the value of `newnewk` is updated accordingly; `st` is incremented by 1**
