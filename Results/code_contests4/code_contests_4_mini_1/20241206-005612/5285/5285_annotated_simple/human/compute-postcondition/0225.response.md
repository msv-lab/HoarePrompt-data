`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Initially, `newizv` is 1, so after executing the code, `newizv` becomes `1 * 2 + 1`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 3**
