`izv` is increased by `newizv`, but the values of `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, and `st` are not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is decreased by `newk`, with the condition for the loop to execute again being that `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is decreased by `newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than `newk * st`.**
