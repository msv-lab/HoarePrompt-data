`d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `d_osn[cur]` is not specified, but it will now hold its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is now incremented by 1, and `cur` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is now incremented by 1, `cur` is 2**
