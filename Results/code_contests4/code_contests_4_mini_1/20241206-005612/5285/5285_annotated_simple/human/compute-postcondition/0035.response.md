Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. If `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 2 while remaining greater than or equal to the square root of `b`.***
