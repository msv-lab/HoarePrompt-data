Postcondition: ***`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk` multiplied by `newk` multiplied by ... (st times), `st` is equal to 0, `i` is increased by `st`, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` (newnewk = newk^0), which means `newnewk` is equal to 1.***
