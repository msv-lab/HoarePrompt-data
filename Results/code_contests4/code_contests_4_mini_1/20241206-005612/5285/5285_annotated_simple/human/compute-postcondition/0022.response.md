The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is now less than or equal to `sqrt(b)`, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
