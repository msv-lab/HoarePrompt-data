The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the largest integer such that `newk` raised to the power of `st` is less than or equal to `newn`, and `st` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop.
