According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop can execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by itself `st` times (which means `newn >= newk ** st`).
- `st` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is equal to `st`.
- `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need `newn` to be strictly greater than `newk ** st`. Since `newn` is currently equal to or greater than `newk ** st`, we need to adjust `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`.

Therefore, we can state that for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` must be strictly greater than `newk ** st`.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`**
