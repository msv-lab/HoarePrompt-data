The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, which is equal to `2^st - 1`. Since the previous value of `izv` is initialized to 0, after execution, `izv` will be equal to `newizv`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `k` raised to the power of `st`, `b` is greater than 1, `d_osn` contains at least one prime factor, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and `izv` is now equal to `newizv`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is `k` raised to the power of `st`, `b` is greater than 1, `d_osn` contains at least one prime factor, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `izv` is now equal to `newizv`.**
