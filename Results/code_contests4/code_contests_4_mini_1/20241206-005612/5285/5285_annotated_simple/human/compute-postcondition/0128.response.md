According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `newnewk` is equal to `newnewk * newk` (which means `newnewk` has been updated) and `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must remain less than or equal to `newn`.

Since `newnewk` has been updated to `newnewk * newk`, we need to ensure that this value is still less than or equal to `newn`. Thus, we require that `newn` is greater than `newnewk * newk`.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than newnewk * newk**
