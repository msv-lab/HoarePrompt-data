Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` remains `st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), `st` is at least 0, and `newizv` remains `2^st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), otherwise `newizv` is 0.**
