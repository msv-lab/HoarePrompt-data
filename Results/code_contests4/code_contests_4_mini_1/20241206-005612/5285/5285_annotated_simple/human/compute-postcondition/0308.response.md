According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, thus `i` will be 1. Additionally, `st` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
