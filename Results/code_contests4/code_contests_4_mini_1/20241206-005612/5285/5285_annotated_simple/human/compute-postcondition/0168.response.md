The value of `i` is assigned 0, which overwrites its previous value of 10. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`.

Output State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`**.
