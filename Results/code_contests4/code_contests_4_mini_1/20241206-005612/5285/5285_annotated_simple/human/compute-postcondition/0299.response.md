According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `newnewk` equal to `newk * newk` and `newn` is equal to `n`. The condition for the loop to execute again states that `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. To ensure the loop can run one more time, we need to adjust `newnewk` so that it is less than or equal to `newn`.

Since `newnewk` is currently equal to `newk * newk`, and we need `newnewk` to be less than or equal to `newn`, we can deduce that `newn` should be greater than `newnewk` to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newnewk`**
