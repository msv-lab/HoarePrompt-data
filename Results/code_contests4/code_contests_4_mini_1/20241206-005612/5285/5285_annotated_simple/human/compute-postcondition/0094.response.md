The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. The value of `newnewk` was equal to `newk` before this operation, so after execution, `newnewk` becomes `newk * newk`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`.**
