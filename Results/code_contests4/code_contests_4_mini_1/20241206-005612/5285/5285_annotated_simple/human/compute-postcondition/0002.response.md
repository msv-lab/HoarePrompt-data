The code `d_osn = defaultdict(int)` initializes a new variable `d_osn` as a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `int`. This means that any key accessed in `d_osn` that does not exist will automatically be created with a default value of `0`. The values of `n`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged, as this line only affects the new variable `d_osn`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, and `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, and `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
