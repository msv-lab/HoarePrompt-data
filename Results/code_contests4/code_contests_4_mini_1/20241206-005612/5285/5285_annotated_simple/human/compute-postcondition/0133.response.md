`st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 3, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, which affects its value, allowing the loop to potentially execute again if `newn` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `newnewk` after multiplication.
