The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables `newnewk`, `i`, and `newk` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk`**.
