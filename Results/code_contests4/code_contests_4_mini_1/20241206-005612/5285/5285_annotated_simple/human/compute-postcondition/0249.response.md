The value of `st` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `st` is unknown. The other variable `newnewk` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is updated to be the product of its previous value and `newk`; `st` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`newnewk` is updated to be the product of its previous value and `newk`; `st` is incremented by 1.**
