According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been decreased by `newk`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the relationship between `newn` and `newk * st`. Specifically, we need `newn` to be greater than `newk * st`. Since `newn` is currently decreased, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`. 

Thus, if we denote the previous value of `newn` before the decrease as `newn_prev`, it must hold that:

`newn_prev - newk > newk * st`

Rearranging gives:

`newn_prev > newk * (st + 1)`

Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, we must adjust the state to show that `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`.

State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`**
