`newizv` is assigned the value 0, which is already its current value. Therefore, there is no change in the value of `newizv`, and the states of the other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects that `newizv` remains 0. 

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` is 0, `st` is 0, and `newizv` remains 0.**
