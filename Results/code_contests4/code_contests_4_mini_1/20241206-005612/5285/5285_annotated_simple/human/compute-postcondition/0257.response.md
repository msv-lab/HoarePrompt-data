According to the code, the loop will execute if `st` is greater than 0 because the `range(st)` function generates a sequence from 0 to `st - 1`. If `st` is equal to 0, the loop will not execute, as it would not have any iterations. Given that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this implies that `st` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `st` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and `i` will start from 0 on the first execution of the loop.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
