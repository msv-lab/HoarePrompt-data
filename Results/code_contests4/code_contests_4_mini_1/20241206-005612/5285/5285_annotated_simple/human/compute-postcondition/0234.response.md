The line of code `newn = newn - newk ** st` updates the value of `newn` by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value. Given that `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk ** st`, the result of this operation will ensure that `newn` becomes less than or equal to its previous value, which is already less than or equal to `newk ** st`. Thus, `newn` will remain less than or equal to `newk ** st` after the operation. The states of `newnewk`, `izv`, and `newk` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` after the operation.**
