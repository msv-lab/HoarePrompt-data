According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `d_osn` variable, which contains the prime factorization counts of the original value of `b`. For the loop to execute, `d_osn` must contain at least one prime factor. Given that `b` is 1, the prime factorization would yield an empty result, meaning `d_osn` would be empty as well.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `d_osn` has at least one entry for the loop to execute. This means `b` should be greater than 1 to have a non-empty prime factorization. Furthermore, the variable `k` should be set to the first key in `d_osn` when it is populated.

State: **`b` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time `d_osn` must contain at least one prime factor, and `k` is the first key in `d_osn`**
