According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `st` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Since `st` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `st` must be at least 2.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`; `i` is 1; `st` is at least 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
