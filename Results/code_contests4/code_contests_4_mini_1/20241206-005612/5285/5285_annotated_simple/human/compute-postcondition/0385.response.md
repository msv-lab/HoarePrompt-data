The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Since `st` is 0, `newk ** st` equals 1 (any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, `newn` is decreased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is 0; `i` is -1; `izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is decreased by 1.**
