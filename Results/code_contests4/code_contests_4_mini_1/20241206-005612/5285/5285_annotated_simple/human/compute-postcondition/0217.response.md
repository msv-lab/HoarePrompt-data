The code increments the value of `st` by 1. The previous value of `st` is 2, so after execution, `st` will be 3. The values of the other variables (`newnewk` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared; `st` is 3; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared; `st` is 3; `i` is 0**
