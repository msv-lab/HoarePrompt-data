The value of `b` is divided by `cur`. Since `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, the new value of `b` will be less than or equal to `b / sqrt(b)`, which is `sqrt(b)`. The value of `n` and the increment of `d_osn[cur]` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is now less than or equal to `sqrt(b)`, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is now less than or equal to `sqrt(b)`, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and `d_osn[cur]` is increased by 1.**
