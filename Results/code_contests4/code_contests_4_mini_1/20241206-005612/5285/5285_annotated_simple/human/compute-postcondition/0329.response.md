The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, the operation results in `newnewk` being equal to `newk * newk`, which is `newk^2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `newk` or greater than `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `newk` or greater than `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`**
