To determine if the `while` loop will execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition in the loop: `newn > newk ** st`. 

1. **Given State Analysis**:
   - `newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`, which implies:
     - `newn > newk^st + newk` 
   - `i` is `st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), which we don't need to adjust for the loop execution.
   - `st` is at least 0, which is acceptable for the loop condition.
   - `newizv` is defined based on the value of `st`, which does not affect the loop execution condition directly.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, we need `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`. 
   - Since we know `newn > newk^(st + 1)`, it follows that `newn` will also be greater than `newk^st` because `newk^(st + 1)` is greater than `newk^st` if `newk` is positive.

Thus, based on the provided information, the current state fulfills the condition required for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, since the loop can execute without any adjustments, we will simply repeat the state.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`; `i` is `st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0); `st` is at least 0; `newizv` is `2^st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), otherwise `newizv` is 0.**
