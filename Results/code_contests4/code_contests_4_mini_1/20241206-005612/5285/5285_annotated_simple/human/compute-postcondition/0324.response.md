The code initializes the variable `st` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables, as no other variables are mentioned in the initial state or the code. Therefore, `st` now holds the value of 0, while the conditions regarding `newn`, `newk`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `st` is 0**
