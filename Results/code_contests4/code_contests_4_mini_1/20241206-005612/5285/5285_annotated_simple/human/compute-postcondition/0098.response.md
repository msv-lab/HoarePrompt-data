`st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 2, the new value of `st` becomes 3. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 3; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk multiplied by newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 3; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk multiplied by newk.**
