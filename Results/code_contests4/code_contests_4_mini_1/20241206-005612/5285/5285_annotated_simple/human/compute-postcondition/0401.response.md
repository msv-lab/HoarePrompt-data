Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values calculated during each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` is 10, `st` is at least 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0, otherwise `newizv` is 0. If `res` is equal to -1, then `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`, which is `izv // d_osn[k]`. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to `mlt`.***
