The variable `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, but it will be increased by the current value of `newizv`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is decreased by `newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk * (st + 1)`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
