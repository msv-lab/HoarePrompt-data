The value of `cur` is incremented by 2. The initial state indicates that `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, but the exact values of `n`, `b`, and `cur` are not specified. Therefore, after the execution, only the increment of `cur` can be noted. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `cur` is increased by 2**
