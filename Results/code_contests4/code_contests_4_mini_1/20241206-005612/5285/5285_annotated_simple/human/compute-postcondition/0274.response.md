Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is equal to the initial `izv` plus the product of `newizv` and the total number of iterations executed, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations executed (which is at most 10), `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` is greater than or equal to 0.**
