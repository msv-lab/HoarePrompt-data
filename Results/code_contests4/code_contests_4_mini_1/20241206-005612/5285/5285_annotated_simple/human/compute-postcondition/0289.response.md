The variable `st` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state indicates that `st` was greater than or equal to `0`, which means it could have been any non-negative value. However, after the execution of the code, `st` is now explicitly `0`. The other variables (`newn`, `izv`, `newnewk`, `mlt`, `res`, `newk`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`; `izv` is 0; `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is 0; `mlt` is assigned the updated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`; `newk` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`; `izv` is 0; `newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is 0; `mlt` is assigned the updated value of `izv // d_osn[k]`; `res` is equal to `mlt` if `res` was -1; otherwise, `res` is updated to the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`; `newk` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0**.
