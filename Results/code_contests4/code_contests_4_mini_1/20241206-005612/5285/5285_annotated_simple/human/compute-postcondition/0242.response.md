The variable `newizv` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is reset to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `st` is now 0; `newizv` is 0.
