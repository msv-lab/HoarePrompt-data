To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`.

Given the state before the loop:
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
- `st` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0 or -1 if `st` is 0.
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0 or 0 if `st` is 0.

The loop will execute as long as `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`. Since `newnewk` is defined as `newk ** st`, we can rewrite the condition as `newn > newnewk`.

Now, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `newnewk`, which equals `newk ** st`. 

1. If `st` is 0, `newnewk` becomes `newk ** 0`, which equals 1 (assuming `newk` is not 0). Therefore, `newn` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
2. If `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` will depend on the value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Thus, `newn` must be greater than whatever value `newk ** st` computes to.

Since we don't have specific values for `newn` and `newk`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute, we need `newn` to be greater than `newnewk`.

Thus, we need to ensure that:
- If `st` is 0, then `newn` must be greater than 1.
- If `st` is greater than 0, we need to ensure `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute the first time newn must be greater than newnewk (which is newk raised to the power of st)**
