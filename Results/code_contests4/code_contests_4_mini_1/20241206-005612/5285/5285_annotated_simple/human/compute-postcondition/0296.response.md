According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is equal to `n`. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, `newnewk` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `newn`. Since `st` has been increased by 1, it does not affect the conditions for the loop to execute again.

State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
