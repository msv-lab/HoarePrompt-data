Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory. If `cur` is 2, then `cur` is updated to 3, and `b` is not divisible by `cur`. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 2 from its previous value and is not equal to 2.***
