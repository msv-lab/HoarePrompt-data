The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`, `st` is 0.

Output State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`, `st` is 0**
