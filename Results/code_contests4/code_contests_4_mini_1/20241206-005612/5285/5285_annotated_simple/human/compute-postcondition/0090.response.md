According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop can execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. For the loop to execute one time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, for the loop to run the first time, `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk` (which is currently equal to `newnewk`). 

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
