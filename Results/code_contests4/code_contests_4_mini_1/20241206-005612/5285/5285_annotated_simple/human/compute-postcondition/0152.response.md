The value of `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The variable `newn` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, ensuring that the loop will execute again with `newn` at least 2. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, and `newizv` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1; `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
