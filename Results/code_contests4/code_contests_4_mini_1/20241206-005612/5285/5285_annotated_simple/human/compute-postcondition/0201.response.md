`izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The values of `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `izv` due to the addition of `newizv`. 

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is the number of iterations executed; `i` is `st - 1`; `izv` is increased by `newizv`.**
