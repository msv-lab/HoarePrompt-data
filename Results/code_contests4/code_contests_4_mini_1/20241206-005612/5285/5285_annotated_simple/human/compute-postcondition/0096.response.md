According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will continue as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk`, and for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`. Since `newn` is already greater than or equal to `newk`, it can be adjusted to ensure that `newnewk` does not exceed `newn` for the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `newn` is at least equal to `newnewk`, which is `newk multiplied by newk`. So, the condition for `newn` needs to be adjusted to ensure it remains greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`; `st` is 2; `i` is increased by 1; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk multiplied by newk`; for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`.**
