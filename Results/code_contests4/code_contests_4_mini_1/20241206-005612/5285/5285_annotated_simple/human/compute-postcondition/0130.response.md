`st` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value was 1, it will now be 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
