According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is greater than 0, which allows for more iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by itself `st` times; `st` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 2.**
