According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`, and `newn` is greater than `newk^2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must remain less than or equal to `newn`. 

Since `newnewk` is `newk^3` and `newk^3` is greater than `newk^2`, `newn` must be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than or equal to `newk^3`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `newn` must be at least `newk^3`.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^2` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk^3`**.
