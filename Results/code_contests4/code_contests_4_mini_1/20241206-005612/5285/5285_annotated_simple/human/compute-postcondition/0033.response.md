The value of `cur` is assigned the value 3. The initial state indicates that `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, but we do not have information about the previous value of `cur`. The variables `n` and `b` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `cur` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `cur` is 3**
