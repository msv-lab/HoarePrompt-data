`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The values of `newnewk`, `i`, and the loop conditions are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 2, `i` is 0, and the loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 2, `i` is 0, and the loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`.**
