The variable `newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is not specified, but its value will be changed based on the current execution. Other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `st`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by itself `st` times, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk` multiplied by itself `st` times, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1**.
