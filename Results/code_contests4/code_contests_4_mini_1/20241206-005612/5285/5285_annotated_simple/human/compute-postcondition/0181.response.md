The code `newnewk *= newk` multiplies the value of `newnewk` by `newk`. The previous values of `newnewk` and `newk` affect the outcome. The other variables (`newn`, `newk`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**.
