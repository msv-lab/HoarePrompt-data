To analyze the output state after the while loop has executed, we start from the initial state and consider how the variables change during each iteration.

**Initial State:** 
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk`
- `st` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `newizv` is 0

**Loop Execution:**
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk` (which is `newk * newk`)
   - `st` increments to 1

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk` (which is now `newk` cubed)
   - `st` increments to 2

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `newnewk` is updated to `newnewk * newk` (which is now `newk` raised to the fourth power)
   - `st` increments to 3

This process continues until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. 

After all iterations:
- `newnewk` will be equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` (the number of iterations).
- The loop continues until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`, meaning that `st` will contain the maximum number of times `newk` could be multiplied before exceeding `newn`.

**Output State:**
At the end of the loop:
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`
- `st` is the maximum number of iterations until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`
- `i` remains 0
- `newizv` remains 0

Output State: **`newnewk` is `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is the number of iterations before `newnewk` exceeds `newn`, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0.**
