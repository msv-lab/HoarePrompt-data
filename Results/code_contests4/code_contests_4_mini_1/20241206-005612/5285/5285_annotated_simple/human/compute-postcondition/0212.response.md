According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`**
