Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is the maximum number of iterations until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`, `i` remains 0, `newizv` remains 0. If `st` is 0, then `newnewk` does not exceed `newn` and the loop has been exited without further iterations.***
