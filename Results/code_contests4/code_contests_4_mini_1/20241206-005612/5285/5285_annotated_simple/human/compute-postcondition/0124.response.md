`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`. The value of `newk` is not specified, but `newnewk` will take on that value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `i` is between 1 and 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
