The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, but since there is no specific value provided for `newk`, we cannot determine the exact value of `newnewk`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `st` is now 0; `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`.
