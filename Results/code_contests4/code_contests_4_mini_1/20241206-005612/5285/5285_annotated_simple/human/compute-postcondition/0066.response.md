The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is `k` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is 0, `b` is greater than 1, `d_osn` contains at least one prime factor for the loop to execute, `k` is the first key in `d_osn`, `izv` is initialized to 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` exceeds `newn` at the end of the loop; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
