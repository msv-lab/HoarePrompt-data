According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `st`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `st` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`; `i` is 2; `st` must be greater than 2; `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`**.
