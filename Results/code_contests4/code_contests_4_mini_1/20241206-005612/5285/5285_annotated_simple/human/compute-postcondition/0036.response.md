Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. If `b` is divisible by `cur`, then `b` is divided by `cur`, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1, and we skip to the next iteration. If `b` is not divisible by `cur`, and `cur` is equal to 2, then `cur` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 2 while remaining greater than or equal to the square root of `b`.***
