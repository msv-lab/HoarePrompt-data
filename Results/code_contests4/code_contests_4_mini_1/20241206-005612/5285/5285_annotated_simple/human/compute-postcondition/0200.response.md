According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop continues as long as `newn` is greater than `newk * st`. At the end of the last iteration, we have:

- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is the number of iterations executed
- `i` is `st - 1`
- `newn` has been decreased by `newk`

Since `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, this implies that the condition `newn > newk * st` will not hold true unless `st` is adjusted. In order for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `newn` is still greater than `newk * st`. 

Given that `newn` has already been decreased by `newk`, for the loop to execute again, `st` needs to be less than the value that would make `newn` equal to or greater than `newk * st`. Specifically, we need:

- `newn` must be adjusted to be at least equal to `newk * st + 1` (to ensure the condition continues to hold).

Thus, we need to specify that `newn` must be increased such that it is greater than `newk * st`. 

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`; `st` is the number of iterations executed; `i` is `st - 1`; and for the loop to execute again, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk * st`**.
