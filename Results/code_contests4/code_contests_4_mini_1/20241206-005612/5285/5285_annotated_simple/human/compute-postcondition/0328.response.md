According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `newnewk` and `newn`. The loop will execute if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, it is necessary that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Since `newnewk` equals `newk`, it is also necessary for `newn` to be equal to `newk` or greater than `newk`.

State: **`newn` is equal to `newk` or greater than `newk`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0; `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
