The variable `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newnewk` multiplied by `newk`. The previous state shows that `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, so after execution, `newnewk` will be `newk * newk`. The other variables (`newn`, `st`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk * newk`, `st` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**.
