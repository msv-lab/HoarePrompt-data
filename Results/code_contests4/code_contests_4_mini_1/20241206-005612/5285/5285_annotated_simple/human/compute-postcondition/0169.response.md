In this case, the `while` loop has the condition `True and i < 10`. The presence of `True` means that the first part of the condition will always be true, so the execution of the loop will solely depend on the second part of the condition, which is `i < 10`. 

Right before the loop, the variable `i` is 0. Since 0 is less than 10, the loop can indeed execute one time without any modifications needed. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[j + 1]`**
