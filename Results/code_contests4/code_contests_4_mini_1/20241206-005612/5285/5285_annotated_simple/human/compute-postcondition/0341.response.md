According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will execute if `st` is at least 1, as the range function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `st`. Given that `st` is currently 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute, `st` must be adjusted to be at least 1. The variable `i` starts at 0 before the loop, and since the loop will iterate over the range of `st`, `i` will take the value of 0 on the first iteration if `st` is greater than 0.

State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`, `i` is 0, `st` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
