The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was previously `st - 1`, and `st` is 0, `i` becomes `0 - 1 + 1`, which is `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` is 0, `st` is 0, and `newizv` remains 0.
