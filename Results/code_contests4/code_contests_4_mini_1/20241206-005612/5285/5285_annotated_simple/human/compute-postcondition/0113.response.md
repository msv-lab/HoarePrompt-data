According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn` and `newk`. The loop will execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` has been updated to `newn - newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must still be greater than `newk`. 

Since `newn` is now `newn - newk`, we can express the condition for the next iteration as follows: 

For the loop to execute again, we need `newn - newk > newk`, which simplifies to `newn > 2 * newk`.

State: **`newn` is updated to `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `2 * newk`**
