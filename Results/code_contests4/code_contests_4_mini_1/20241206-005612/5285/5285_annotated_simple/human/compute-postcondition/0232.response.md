According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is currently less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st` and for the loop to execute again `newn` needs to be greater than `newk ** st`**
