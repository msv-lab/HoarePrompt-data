The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. Since `newk` is less than `newn` and `st` is the number of iterations executed, `newk ** st` represents a significant reduction in the value of `newn`. The other variables (`newnewk`, `st`, `i`, `izv`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `i` is `st - 1`, `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of iterations executed, `i` is `st - 1`, `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.**
