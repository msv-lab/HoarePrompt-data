The expression `newn = newn - newk ** st` updates the value of `newn` by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value. The previous values of `newn` and `newk` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, after executing the code, we know that `newn` has been updated, but we cannot determine its exact new value without the specific values of `newk` and `st`. The state of `izv` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`; `newn` is updated but its exact value cannot be determined without specific values for `newk` and `st`.**
