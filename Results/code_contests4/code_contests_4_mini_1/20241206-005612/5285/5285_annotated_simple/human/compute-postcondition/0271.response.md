`izv` is assigned the value of `izv + newizv`, which increases `izv` by the value of `newizv`. The other variables (`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, and `newk`) remain unaffected by this operation, so their previous states do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk * st` after being decreased by `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be adjusted to be greater than `newk * st` after being decreased by `newk`.**
