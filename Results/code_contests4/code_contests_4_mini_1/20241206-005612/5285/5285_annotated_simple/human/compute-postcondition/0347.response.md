The loop iterates `st` times, updating `newizv` during each iteration. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `st - 1`, and `newizv` will be equal to the result of the expression `((2^st) - 1)` if `st` is greater than 0. If `st` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `newizv` will remain 0. 

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `newizv` is equal to `2^st - 1`, `i` is `st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), and `st` remains as initially defined.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^(st + 1)`; `i` is `st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0); `st` is at least 0; `newizv` is `2^st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), otherwise `newizv` is 0.**
