`st` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk^2`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`.

Output State: **`newn` is greater than `newk^2`, `i` is less than or equal to 10, `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`**
