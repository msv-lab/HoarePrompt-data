The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `b`, `cur`, and `d_osn[cur]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12) divided by `cur`, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
