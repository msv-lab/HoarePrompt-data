To analyze the loop, we will observe the changes in the variables after each iteration based on the provided initial state and loop code.

Initial State: 
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`
- `st` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0 or -1 if `st` is 0
- `newizv` is `2^st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0 or 0 if `st` is 0

Loop Behavior:
- The loop continues while `newn > newk ** st`
- Each iteration will add `newizv` to `izv` and decrease `newn` by `newk ** st`

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can conclude the following:

1. After 1 iteration, `newn` is reduced by `newk ** st` and `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
2. After 2 iterations, `newn` is further reduced, and will continue to be reduced until it is less than or equal to `newk ** st`.
3. The loop will terminate when `newn` becomes less than or equal to `newk ** st`.

Final State:
- After all iterations of the loop have executed, `newn` will be less than or equal to `newk ** st`.
- The value of `izv` will be incremented by `newizv` for each successful iteration of the loop.
- The loop control variable `newn` can be zero or a positive value less than `newk ** st` depending on the initial values.

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv` for each iteration until the loop's condition fails.**
