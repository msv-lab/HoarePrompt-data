According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, which indicates that `newk` is likely less than `newn` when `st` is not 0.
- `st` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning it can be 0 or positive.
- `newizv` is equal to `(2^st) - 1`, and `i` is equal to `st - 1` if `st` is greater than 0. If `st` is 0, `newizv` remains unchanged.

To ensure that the loop can execute:
1. Since `newn > newk ** st` must hold true for the loop to run, if `st` is 0, then `newk` must be less than `newn`, since `newk ** 0` is 1 (and thus `newn` needs to be greater than 1).
2. If `st` is greater than 0, `newk` raised to `st` should still be less than `newn`.

Given that `newnewk` is already greater than `newn`, we need to ensure that `newk` is adjusted accordingly to satisfy the loop condition.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to adjust `newk` to be less than `newn`, while ensuring that `st` remains non-negative.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `newk` must be less than `newn`**.
