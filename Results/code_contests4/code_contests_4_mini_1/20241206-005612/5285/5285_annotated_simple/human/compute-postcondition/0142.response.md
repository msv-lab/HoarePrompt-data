According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11 and for the loop to execute again, `st` must be greater than 11. Additionally, `newizv` has been updated, but that does not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newnewk`, `i` is 11, for the loop to execute a second time `st` must be greater than 11, `newizv` is updated to `newizv * 2 + 1`**
