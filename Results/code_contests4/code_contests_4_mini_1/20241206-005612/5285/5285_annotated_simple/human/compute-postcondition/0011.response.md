The variable `cur` is assigned the value `3`, replacing its previous value of `2`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cur` is 3, and `b` is not divisible by `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cur` is 3, and `b` is not divisible by `cur`.**
