The variable `newn` is assigned the value `newn - newk ** st`. Since `newn` is greater than 1 and has been decreased by 1, its previous value is still more than 1. The variables `newk` and `st` are involved in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, `newn` will be decreased by the result of `newk ** st`. The output state reflects the change in `newn`, while the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`, and `izv` is increased by `newizv`**
