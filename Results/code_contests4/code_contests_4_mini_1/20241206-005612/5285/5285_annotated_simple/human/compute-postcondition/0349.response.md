`izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The value of `newizv` is determined by the condition of `st`: if `st` is greater than 0, then `newizv` is `2^st - 1`; otherwise, it is 0. Since we know that `st` is at least 0, `newizv` will either be `2^st - 1` (if `st > 0`) or 0 (if `st = 0`). The previous value of `izv` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `izv` based on the value of `newizv`.

Output State: **`izv` is increased by `newizv`, where `newizv` is either `2^st - 1` (if `st > 0`) or 0 (if `st = 0)**.
