According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` multiplied by `newk` and `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `newn`. 

Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk * newk`, it will execute again if `newk * newk` is less than or equal to `newn`. This means that for the loop to continue, we can state that `newn` needs to be greater than or equal to `newk * newk`. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is that `newn` must be greater than or equal to `newk * newk`.

State: **`newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`, `st` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk multiplied by newk`**
