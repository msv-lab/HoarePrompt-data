According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10, and since it is a `while True` loop, it can always execute if the condition allows it. At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` remains `st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0) and `st` is at least 0. This means that the value of `i` depends on the value of `st`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than 10. If `st` is greater than 0, then `i` is `st - 1`, which implies that for `i` to be less than 10, `st` must be at most 10. So, we need to adjust the condition to ensure `st` is less than or equal to 10.

Since `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, we do not need to adjust it for the loop to execute again, as it does not directly affect the loop condition.

State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` remains `st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), `st` is at least 0, and for the loop to execute again `st` must be less than or equal to 10, `newizv` remains `2^st - 1` (if `st` is greater than 0), otherwise `newizv` is 0**
