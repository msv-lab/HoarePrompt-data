The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. Given that `newn` is `n - k` and `newk` is a variable, `st` is an exponent, the exact value of `newn` will depend on the values of `newk` and `st`. The value of `newn` will decrease based on the result of `newk ** st`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`.

Output State: **`newn` is decreased by `newk ** st`**
