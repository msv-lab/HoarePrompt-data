The value of `st` is assigned 0. Since `st` is at least 0, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` remains `st - 1`, `st` is 0, and `newizv` remains `2^st - 1` (which is `2^0 - 1 = 0`).

Output State: **`newn` is less than or equal to `newk^st`, `izv` is the sum of `newizv` added for each iteration until the loop condition was no longer met, `i` remains `st - 1`, `st` is 0, and `newizv` remains 0.**
