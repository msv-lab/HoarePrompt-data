To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `newn > newk ** st`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `newnewk` is greater than `newn`
- `st` is 0
- `i` is -1
- `izv` is increased by `newizv`
- `newn` is decreased by 1

Given that `st` is 0, the expression `newk ** st` evaluates to `1` (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, the condition `newn > newk ** st` simplifies to `newn > 1`.

Since `newn` has been decreased by 1 in the last iteration, we need to adjust `newn` to ensure it is greater than `1` for the loop to execute again. This means that before the last decrement, `newn` must have been at least `3` (greater than `1` after decrementing).

Thus, we need to modify the state as follows: we can state that `newn` must be at least `3` currently for the loop to execute again.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and for the loop to execute again `newn` must be at least 3**.
