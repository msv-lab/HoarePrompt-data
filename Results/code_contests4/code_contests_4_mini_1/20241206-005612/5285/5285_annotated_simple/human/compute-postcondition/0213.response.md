The value of `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. Since `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, the result of the operation will be `newnewk *= newk`, which is equivalent to `newnewk = newnewk * newk = newk * newk`. The exact value of `newnewk` after the operation will depend on the value of `newk`, but it is known that `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared.

The other variables `st`, `i`, and the condition for the loop remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and the loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`.

Output State: **`newnewk` is now equal to `newk` squared, `st` is 1, `i` is 0, and the loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than or equal to `newk`.**
