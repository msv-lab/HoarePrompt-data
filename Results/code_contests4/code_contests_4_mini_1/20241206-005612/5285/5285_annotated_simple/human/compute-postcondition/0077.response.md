The variable `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The previous value of `newn` is `n`, and `newk` is equal to `k`. So, `newk ** st` calculates to `k ** st`. Therefore, the new value of `newn` will be `n - k ** st`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newn` is `n - k ** st`, `newk` is `k`, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, and `izv` is now equal to `newizv`.**
