According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. The loop will only execute if `st` is greater than 0. Since the state before the loop starts indicates that `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk` until it exceeded `newn`, if `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, meaning the loop cannot execute.

For the loop to be executed, `st` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `st` is at least 1.

State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
