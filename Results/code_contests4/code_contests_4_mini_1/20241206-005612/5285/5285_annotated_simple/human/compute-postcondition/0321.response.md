The variable `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk ** st` from it. Since `st` is 0, `newk ** st` evaluates to 1 (any number to the power of 0 is 1). Thus, `newn` is decreased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is equal to `n - 2 - 1`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv`.

Output State: **`newn` is equal to `n - 3`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `izv` is increased by `newizv`**.
