Postcondition: ***`newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is the accumulated value based on the prime factorization involving `newk`, `i` is 10, and `mlt` is assigned the value of `izv // d_osn[k]`. If `res` was initially -1, then `res` is updated to be equal to `mlt`. Otherwise, if `mlt` is less than the previous value of `res`, then `res` is updated to be equal to `mlt`.***
