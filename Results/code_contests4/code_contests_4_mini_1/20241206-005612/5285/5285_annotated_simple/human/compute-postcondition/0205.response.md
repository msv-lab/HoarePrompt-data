The variable `st` is assigned the value `0`, which directly changes its previous value of at least `10`. The values of `newnewk` and `newn` remain unaffected, as does `i`, which was previously `st - 1` and will now be `-1` because `st` is now `0`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `st` and `i`, while noting that the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `i` is -1**
