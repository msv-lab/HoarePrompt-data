According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `b` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `b` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 10^12, which means that `b` can be 2 or greater. As long as `b` is greater than 1, the loop will execute. 

Given that `b` is already a positive integer (which means it is at least 2), it meets the condition to enter the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are required to the state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `cur` is 2**
