According to the code, the loop continues executing as long as `b` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is a positive integer and is currently greater than 1, so the loop can execute again without any modifications to `b`. Therefore, the states of `n`, `b`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12), and `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`**
