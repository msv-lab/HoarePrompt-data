The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `b` (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12). It calculates the prime factorization of `b`, counts the factors, and uses these counts to derive a result based on the powers of the prime factors compared to `n`. The function outputs the minimum value of a calculated variable derived from these factors or -1 if no valid calculations were made. Edge cases include the possibility of `b` being reduced to 1 and the handling of the prime factors in relation to `n`.
