Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the handling of the output when determining if there is certainty about the shared number is flawed.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Output Logic**: The requirements specify three possible outputs:
   - The common number if it can be deduced with certainty.
   - `0` if both participants know the number but the observer cannot deduce it.
   - `-1` if there is ambiguity and neither participant can deduce the number with certainty.

   In the provided program, the checks for determining if exactly one successful match was found are incorrect. The code only prints `ans` if `sum(A[i][0] for i in range(n)) == 1 or sum(B[i][0] for i in range(m)) == 1`. This could lead to situations where the output does not reflect the correct state as per the problem description.

2. **Handling of Ambiguity**: The program checks for conflicts by exiting with `-1` if `A[i][1]` or `B[i][1]` does not match expected conditions. However, it does not correctly track the scenarios where both participants might have knowledge of the common number but the observer does not. This logic is essential in determining when to print `0`.

3. **Incorrect Aggregation**: The program tries to determine a single `ans` from both `A` and `B` without ensuring that they match correctly in terms of deducing the shared number. The approach can lead to scenarios where the number is printed incorrectly or where the output does not match the problem requirements.

4. **Potential Infinite Loop or Incorrect Exit**: The exit calls in the loops do not handle all cases properly. If there are multiple matches, the program will exit before evaluating all pairs, which can lead to incomplete logic.

The combination of these issues indicates that the program does not consistently adhere to the requirements set by the problem description. Therefore, it is not correct.
