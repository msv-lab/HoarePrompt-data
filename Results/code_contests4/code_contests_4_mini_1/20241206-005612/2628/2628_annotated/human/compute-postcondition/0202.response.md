The code assigns the values of `a[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. The value of `j` is 1, so `x2` and `y2` will be assigned the values from the second element of the list `a`, which is `a[1]`. The previous values of `x2` and `y2` are not known as they were not specified before this line of code. Other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, and `x2` and `y2` are now assigned the values from `a[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, and `x2` and `y2` are now assigned the values from `a[1]**
