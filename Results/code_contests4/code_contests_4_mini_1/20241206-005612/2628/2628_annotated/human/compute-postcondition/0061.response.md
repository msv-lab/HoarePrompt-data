Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 2, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and execution exits. If `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits with an output of -1. If neither condition is met, `A[0][1]` is set to `x1` if the first condition was true, or `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` if the else part was executed.***
