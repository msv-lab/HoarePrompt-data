The code `print(-1)` outputs `-1` to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `n`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `j`, `x2`, or `y2`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, and `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, and `-1` is printed.**
