Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[1]`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no changes are made to `B[i][1]`. If the sets are equal, no changes are made to `B[i]`.***
