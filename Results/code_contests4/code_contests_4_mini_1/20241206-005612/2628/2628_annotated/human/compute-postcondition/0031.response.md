Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits without modifying any variable values and outputs -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no changes are made to the variables.***
