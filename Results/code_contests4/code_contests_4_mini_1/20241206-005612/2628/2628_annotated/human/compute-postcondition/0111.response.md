The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but we do not proceed further with any computation or output. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]` and -1 is printed, and the program exits without further execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]` and -1 is printed, and the program exits without further execution.**
