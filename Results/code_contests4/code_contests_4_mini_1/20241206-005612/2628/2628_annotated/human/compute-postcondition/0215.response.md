Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`. If `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, `B[i][1]` is incremented by 1 and assigned the value of `x1` unless `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, in which case -1 is printed and the program exits. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `B[i][1]` is incremented by 1 and assigned the value of `y1` unless `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, in which case the state remains unchanged. If neither `x1` nor `y1` equal `x2` or `y2`, the program state remains unchanged. If `set(b[i])` is equal to `set(a[j])`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
