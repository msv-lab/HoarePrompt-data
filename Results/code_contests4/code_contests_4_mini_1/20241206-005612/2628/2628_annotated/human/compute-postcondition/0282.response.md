The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, and since the previous state does not specify the exact values, we cannot determine the specific value of `y1`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
