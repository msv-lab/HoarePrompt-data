Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`. The sets formed from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
