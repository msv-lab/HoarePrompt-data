According to the code, the execution of the loop depends primarily on the variable `n`, which represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since `n` is specified to be an input integer between 1 and 12, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, as `n` is always greater than or equal to 1.

At the start of the loop, the index variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for its first iteration. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are simply the initialization of `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
