Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, which is unknown. If the condition is not met, no action is taken.***
