Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is equal to `m` (the number of elements in `b`), `A[i][0]` is the count of successful matches found, and `A[i][1]` is the last value assigned from either `x1` or `y1`, depending on the conditions met during the loop execution. If no conditions were met for any iteration, `A[i][0]` remains 0, and `A[i][1]` remains 0.**
