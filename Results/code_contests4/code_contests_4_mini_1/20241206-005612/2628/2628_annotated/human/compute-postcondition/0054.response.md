The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` to the console. It does not affect the values of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the output of the program includes `-1`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, and the output is -1.**
