Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is `n-1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[n-1]`, `B[i][0]` is the count of valid updates made during the iterations, and `B[i][1]` is either `x1` or `y1` based on the last valid condition met; `x1` and `y1` are now updated to `b[i]`.**
