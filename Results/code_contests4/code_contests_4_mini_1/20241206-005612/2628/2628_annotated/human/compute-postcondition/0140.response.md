Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is either the same or one greater than its previous value, `A[i][1]` is equal to `y1` if `A[i][1]` was not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is one greater than its previous value, and `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`. Additionally, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `a[2]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is assigned the first element of `b[0]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `b[0]`, and the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, with neither `x1` equal to `x2` nor `x1` equal to `y2`, and either `y1` equal to `x2` or `y1` equal to `y2`.***
