The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. However, the values of `y1`, `A[i][0]`, and `A[i][1]` are not directly mentioned in the initial state, except that `A[i][0]` has been increased by 1, which does not affect the assignment to `A[i][1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A[i][1]` now holds the value of `y1`, while the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is increased by 1; `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
