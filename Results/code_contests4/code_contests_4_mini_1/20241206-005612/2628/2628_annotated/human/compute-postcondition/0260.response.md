The code executes the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately. Therefore, no variable values are modified, and the program will not continue to run any further instructions. The output state reflects that the program has exited without any changes to the variable states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned from `a[1]`, and -1 is printed. Program has exited.**
