Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 0. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `x1`, and the values of `x1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned as described, while the set of elements in `a[i]` remains unequal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
