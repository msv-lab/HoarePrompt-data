Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed before termination; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the condition is false, no changes are made.***
