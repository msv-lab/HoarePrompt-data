The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program halts execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the output is -1, and the program has terminated execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the output is -1; the program has terminated execution.**
