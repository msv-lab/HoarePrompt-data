Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[1]`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
