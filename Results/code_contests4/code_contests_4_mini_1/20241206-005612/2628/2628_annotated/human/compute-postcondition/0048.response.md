The code assigns the values from `b[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. Since `j` is 2, the values assigned to `x2` and `y2` will be the elements at index 2 of the list `b`. The previous values of `x2` and `y2` are not specified, but they will now hold the values from `b[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 2, and `x2` and `y2` are now assigned values from `b[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned values from `b[2]**
