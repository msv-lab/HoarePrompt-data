Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of successful matches found throughout all iterations, `A[i][1]` is the last value assigned from either `x1` or `y1` after all iterations, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `a[2]`, and `b` is a list of pairs processed during the loop. If the loop does not execute, `A[i][0]` remains unchanged and `A[i][1]` remains as it was initially.**
