Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, the output is -1 and the program terminates execution. Otherwise, there is an error due to accessing an undefined variable 'a' when trying to perform the operation `B[i][0] += 1`.***
