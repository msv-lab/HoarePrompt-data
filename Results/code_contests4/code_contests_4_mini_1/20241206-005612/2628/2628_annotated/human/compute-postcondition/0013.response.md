Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`. The sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. The value of `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is also not equal to `x1`.***
