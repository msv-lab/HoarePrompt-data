The code `A[i][0] += 1` increments the value of `A[i][0]` by 1. The values of other variables, namely `n`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2`, remain unchanged. The previous value of `A[i][0]` is not specified, but it is increased by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A[i][0]` has changed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
