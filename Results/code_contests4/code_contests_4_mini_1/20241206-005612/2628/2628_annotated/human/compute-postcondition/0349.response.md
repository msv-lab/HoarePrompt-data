Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A` is a list with at least 1 element, and `Ai` is the first element in `A`. If the first element of `Ai` is equal to 1, `ans` could not be assigned due to potential index error. There is no else part in the code.***
