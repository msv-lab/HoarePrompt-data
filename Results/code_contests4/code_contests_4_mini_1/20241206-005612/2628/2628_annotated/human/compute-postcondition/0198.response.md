Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2` and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the function prints -1 and execution is terminated. Otherwise, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
