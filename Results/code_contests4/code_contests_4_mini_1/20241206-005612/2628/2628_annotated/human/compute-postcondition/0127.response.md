The code snippet `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately. No variables are modified, and no values are returned. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program is exiting without any changes to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of successful matches found, `A[i][1]` is the last value assigned from either `x1` or `y1`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `a[2]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is assigned the first element of `b[0]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `b[0]`, the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
