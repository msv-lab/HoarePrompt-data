Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `B` is a list of length `m` where each element is a tuple containing two integers; the first integer is the count of successful matches found for each corresponding tuple in `b`, and the second integer is the last value assigned from either `x1` or `y1`. The sum of the first elements of the tuples in `A` is equal to 1 or the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `B` is equal to 1.***
