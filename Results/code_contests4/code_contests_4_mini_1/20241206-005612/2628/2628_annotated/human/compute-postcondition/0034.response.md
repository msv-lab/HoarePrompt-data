The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` do not change as a result of this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, and the output is `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, and the output is `-1`.**
