The line `B[i][1] = x1` assigns the value of `x1` to the second element of the `i`-th row of the 2D list `B`. The initial state mentions that `x1` is assigned a value from `b[0]`, but does not specify what that value is. Therefore, `x1` retains its value from `b[0]`, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned from `a[1]; B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
