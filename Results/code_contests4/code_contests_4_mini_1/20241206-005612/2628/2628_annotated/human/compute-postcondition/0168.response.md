The value of `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `A[i][0]` is unknown. The values of `n`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 12; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is increased by 1**
