Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits without further execution. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
