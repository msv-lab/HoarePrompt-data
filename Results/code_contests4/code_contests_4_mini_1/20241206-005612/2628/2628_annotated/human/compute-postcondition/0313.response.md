According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, meaning `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will become 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
