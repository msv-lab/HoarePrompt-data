According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value which is less than `m`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be increased by 1. 

Thus, if `j` is currently `k`, where `k` is less than `m`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than `j + 1`.**
