Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`, and the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
