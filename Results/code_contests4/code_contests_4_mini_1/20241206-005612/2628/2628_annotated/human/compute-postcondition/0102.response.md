Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the output is `-1` and the program execution is terminated. Otherwise, `A[1][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, `-1` is printed to the output. Otherwise, `A[1][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[1][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
