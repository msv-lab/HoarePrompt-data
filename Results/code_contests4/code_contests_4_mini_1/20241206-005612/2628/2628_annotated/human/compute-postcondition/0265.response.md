The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program is exited before any further operations can be performed. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the program has been exited. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[1]`, and -1 is printed. The program has exited.**
