Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, `A[0][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[0][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
