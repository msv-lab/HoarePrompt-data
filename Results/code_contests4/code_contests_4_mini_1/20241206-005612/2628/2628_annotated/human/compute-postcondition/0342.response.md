Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, the program checks the conditions related to `B[i][1]` and may exit or produce an error due to undefined variables. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits without further actions, and if `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the output is -1, terminating the program; otherwise, an error occurs due to accessing an undefined variable 'a'. If `set(b[i])` equals `set(a[j])`, no actions are taken as there is no else part defined.***
