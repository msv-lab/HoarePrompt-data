The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The initial state does not provide any information about `y1`, so we cannot determine its specific value. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, which is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, which is unknown.**
