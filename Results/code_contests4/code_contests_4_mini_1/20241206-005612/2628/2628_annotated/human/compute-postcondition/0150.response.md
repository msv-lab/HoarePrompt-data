Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed before exiting. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, while `x2, y2` is assigned the value of `b[j]`.***
