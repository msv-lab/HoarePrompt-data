The value of `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The variable `i` is 2, so `A[2][1]` is updated to `y1`. The specific values of `y1` and `A[2][1]` are not provided, but the array `A` is modified. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2, y2` is assigned the value of `b[j]`; `A[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2, y2` is assigned the value of `b[j]`; `A[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
