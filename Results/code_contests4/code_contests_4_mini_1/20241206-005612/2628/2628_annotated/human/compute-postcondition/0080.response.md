Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`; the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`; `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`; either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`; the value of `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is also not equal to `y1`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
