The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1`. It does not affect the previous values of any variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`, and the output is `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`, and the output is `-1`.**
