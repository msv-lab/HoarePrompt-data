Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, `-1` is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
