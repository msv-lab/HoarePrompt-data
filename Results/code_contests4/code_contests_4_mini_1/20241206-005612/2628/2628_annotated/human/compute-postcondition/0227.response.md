Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, the value -1 is printed. Otherwise, `B[0][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
