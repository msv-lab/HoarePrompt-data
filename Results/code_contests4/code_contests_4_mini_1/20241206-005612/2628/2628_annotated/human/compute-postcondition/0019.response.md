Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
