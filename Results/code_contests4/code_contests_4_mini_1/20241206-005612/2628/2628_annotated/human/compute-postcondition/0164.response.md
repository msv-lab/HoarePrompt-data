The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous states of `n`, `x2`, and `y2` are not directly affected by this assignment. The value of `A[i][1]` will now hold the value of `x1`, but we do not have the specific value of `x1`. Thus, the output state reflects the assignment without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is increased by 1; `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
