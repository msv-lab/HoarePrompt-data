The code outputs `-1`, but it does not change any of the existing variables in the state. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The Output State remains as it was before the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2] and -1 is printed.**
