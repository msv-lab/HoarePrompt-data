Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`. The sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`.***
