Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
