The code assigns the values from `a[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. The value of `j` is currently 1, so `x2` and `y2` will take the values from `a[1]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `x2` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned from `a[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned from `a[1]**
