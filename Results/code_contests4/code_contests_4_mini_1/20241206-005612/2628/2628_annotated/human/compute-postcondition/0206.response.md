The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The value of `x1` is determined by `b[0]`, but the specific value of `b[0]` is not given in the initial state. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `B[i][1]` is updated with the value of `x1`, while the specific value of `x1` remains unknown.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
