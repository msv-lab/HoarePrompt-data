The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that the current execution will stop, and no further changes will occur to any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program ends without any return value as it is not designed to return anything in this context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, and the program exits.**
