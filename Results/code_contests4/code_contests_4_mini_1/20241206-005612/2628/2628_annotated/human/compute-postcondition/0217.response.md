The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, where `j` is 2. The previous values of `x2` and `y2` were assigned from `a[1]`. The values of `a[2]` will now replace them. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 2, and now `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]**
