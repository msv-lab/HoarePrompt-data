The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program execution is stopped. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`, and `-1` has been printed, and we exit the program.
