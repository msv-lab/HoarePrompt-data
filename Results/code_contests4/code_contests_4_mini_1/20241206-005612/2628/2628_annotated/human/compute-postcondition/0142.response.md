Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 0. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is set to `x1`, and the values of `x1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned as described, while the set of elements in `a[i]` remains unequal to the set of elements in `b[j]`. If neither condition holds, then if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `A[i][0]` is either the same or one greater than its previous value, and `A[i][1]` is set to `y1` if it was not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is one greater than its previous value, and `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`. Additionally, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `a[2]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is assigned the first element of `b[0]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `b[0]`, and the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, with neither `x1` equal to `x2` nor `x1` equal to `y2`.***
