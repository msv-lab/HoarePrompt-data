Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[1]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, no changes are made to `B[i][1]`.***
