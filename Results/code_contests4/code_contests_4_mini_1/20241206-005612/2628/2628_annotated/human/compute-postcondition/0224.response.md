The code `exit()` terminates the program execution. As a result, the values of the variables do not change, and the program halts. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[2]`, and the value -1 is printed.
