The code assigns the values of `b[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. The variable `j` is currently 1, so `x2` and `y2` will receive the values from `b[1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]**
