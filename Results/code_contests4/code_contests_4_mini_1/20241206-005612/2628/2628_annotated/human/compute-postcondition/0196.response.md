The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The variable `y1` is previously assigned the value from `b[0]`, and the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, and `B[i][1]` has been assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `B[i][1]` has been assigned the value of `y1`.**
