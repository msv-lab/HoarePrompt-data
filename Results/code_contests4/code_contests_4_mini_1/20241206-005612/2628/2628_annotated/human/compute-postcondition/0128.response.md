Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of successful matches found, `A[i][1]` is the last value assigned from either `x1` or `y1`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `a[2]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is assigned the first element of `b[0]`, `y2` is assigned the second element of `b[0]`, the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. The value of `A[i][1]` is either 0 or equal to `x1`.***
