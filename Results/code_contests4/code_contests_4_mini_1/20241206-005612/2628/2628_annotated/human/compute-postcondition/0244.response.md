Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`, the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, then `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
