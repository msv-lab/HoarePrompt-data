Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `A` is a list of length `n` where each element is a tuple containing two integers; the first integer is the count of successful matches found for each corresponding tuple in `a`, and the second integer is the last value assigned from either `x1` or `y1` based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If no conditions were met for any iteration for an index `i`, the first integer remains 0 and the second integer remains 0.**
