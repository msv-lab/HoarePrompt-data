The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. Consequently, no changes are made to the variable states, and the program ends without returning any values. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of the variables before termination.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]**.
