Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`.***
