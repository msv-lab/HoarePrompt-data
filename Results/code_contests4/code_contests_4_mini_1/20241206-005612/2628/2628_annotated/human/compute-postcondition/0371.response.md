Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and `B` is a list of length `m` where each element is a tuple containing two integers. If the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A` or `B` equals 1, the value of `ans` is the second element of the last tuple in `B` where the first element is 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `A` and `B` is not equal to 1, and the value 0 is printed.***
