Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[0]`; the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`; `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`; if either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, if `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
