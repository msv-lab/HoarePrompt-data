`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The values of `y1` and `B[i][0]` are not specified; however, `y1` is derived from `b[0]`. Since `B[i][0]` was previously increased by 1, it does not impact the assignment of `y1` to `B[i][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
