The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change during this process, but since the program exits, no further operations will be performed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2, y2` is assigned the value of `b[j]`, and -1 is printed before exiting.
