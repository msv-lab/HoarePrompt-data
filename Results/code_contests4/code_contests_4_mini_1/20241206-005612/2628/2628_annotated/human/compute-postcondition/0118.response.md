Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A[i][0]` is the count of successful matches found, `A[i][1]` is the last value assigned from either `x1` or `y1`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `a[i]`, and if the loop executes, `A[i][0]` will reflect the number of successful matches, while `A[i][1]` will contain the value of the last successful match (either `x1` or `y1`). If the loop does not execute, `A[i][0]` remains unchanged, and `A[i][1]` retains its previous value.**
