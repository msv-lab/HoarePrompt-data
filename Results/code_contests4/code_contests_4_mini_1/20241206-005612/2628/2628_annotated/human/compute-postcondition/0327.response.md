Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. If `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, then if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, which is unknown. If `set(b[i])` is equal to `set(a[j])`, no action is taken.***
