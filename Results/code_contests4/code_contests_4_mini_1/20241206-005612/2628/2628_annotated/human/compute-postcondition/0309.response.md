Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
