Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 0. If the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are unequal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, `A[i][1]` is either unchanged or set to `x1` based on the conditions provided, and `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. If neither condition holds, `A[i][0]` is updated based on the relationship between `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, with appropriate assignments to `x1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2`, while maintaining the inequality between the sets.***
