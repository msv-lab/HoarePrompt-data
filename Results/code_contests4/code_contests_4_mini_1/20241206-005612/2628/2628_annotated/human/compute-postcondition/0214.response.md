Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the state of the program remains unchanged; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` and not equal to `y2`, the program state remains unchanged.***
