Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the program exits with an output of -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
