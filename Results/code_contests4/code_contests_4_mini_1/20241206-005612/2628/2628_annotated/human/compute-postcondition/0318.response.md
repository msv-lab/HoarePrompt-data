The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The value of `x1` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific value for `B[i][1]`. The values of other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `B[i][0]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
