According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

So, after this iteration, `j` becomes 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`.**
