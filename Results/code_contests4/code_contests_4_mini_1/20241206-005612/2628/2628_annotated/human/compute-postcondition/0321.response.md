The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program is exited before any further operations can be performed. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and the program is exited before any additional output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and the program is exited.**
