The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[j]`, where `j` is currently 0. Since `j` is 0, this means that `x2` and `y2` will take the values from the first element of `a`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`**.
