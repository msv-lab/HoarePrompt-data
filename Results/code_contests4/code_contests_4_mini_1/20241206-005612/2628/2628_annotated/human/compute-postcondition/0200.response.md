Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`. If the sets formed from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed, and execution is terminated. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` does not equal `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` equals `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed, and execution is terminated. Otherwise, if `y1` equals `x2` or `y2`, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the sets formed from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are equal, no changes are made to the values of `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]`.***
