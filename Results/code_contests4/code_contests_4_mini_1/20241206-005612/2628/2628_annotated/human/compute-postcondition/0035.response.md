The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately without modifying any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, and the output is `-1`.**
