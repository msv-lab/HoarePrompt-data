The statement `B[i][0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `B[i]` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. The previous value of `B[i][0]` is not specified, but it will increase by 1 regardless of its initial state. Therefore, we can state that the operation affects `B[i][0]` but leaves other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
