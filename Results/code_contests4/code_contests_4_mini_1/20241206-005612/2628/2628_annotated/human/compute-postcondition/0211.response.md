The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y1` (which is assigned from `b[0]`) and `B[i][0]` (which has been incremented by 1). The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `j` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[1]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`.**
