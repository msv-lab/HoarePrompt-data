Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the output is `-1` and the program execution is terminated. Otherwise, `A[1][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
