Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`; if the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If none of the conditions are satisfied, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
