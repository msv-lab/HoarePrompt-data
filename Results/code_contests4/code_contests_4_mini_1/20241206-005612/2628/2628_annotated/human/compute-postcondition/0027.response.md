`A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The previous values were that `y1` was assigned from `a[0]`, and `A[i][0]` was increased by 1. The variables `n`, `i`, `x1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
