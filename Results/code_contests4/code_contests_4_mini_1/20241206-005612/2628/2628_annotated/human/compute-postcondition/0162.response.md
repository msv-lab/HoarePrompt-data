The execution of `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the `exit()` command. Therefore, the output state will indicate the current values of the variables and that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`; -1 is printed and the program has exited.**
