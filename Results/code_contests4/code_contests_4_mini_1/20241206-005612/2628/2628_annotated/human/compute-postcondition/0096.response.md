The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program is exiting. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`, and -1 is printed to the output.
