In the given code, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `b[1]`. The state of variable `A` is affected as it will have its second column in the first row (since `i` is 0) updated to the value of `y1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`; `A[0][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`; `A[0][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
