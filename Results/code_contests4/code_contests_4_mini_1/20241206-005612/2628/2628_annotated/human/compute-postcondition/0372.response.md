The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on predefined constraints where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12. The first participant communicates `n` distinct pairs of integers between 1 and 9, and the second participant communicates `m` distinct pairs of integers between 1 and 9, with each pair containing two different integers. The function returns a result based on the interactions of these pairs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle the communication of distinct pairs of integers from two participants, while adhering to the constraints on the number of pairs and the range of integers used. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes distinct pairs of integers communicated by two participants, returning results based on these interactions while adhering to specific constraints.**
