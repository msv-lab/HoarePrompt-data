Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and not equal to `y2`, then if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `B[i][1]`.***
