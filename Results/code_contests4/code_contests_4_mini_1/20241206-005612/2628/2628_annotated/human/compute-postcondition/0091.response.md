The code `exit()` terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program will not continue to execute any further code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[1]`, and the output is `-1`. The program execution has been terminated.
