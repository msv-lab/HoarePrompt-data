The code `exit()` is a command that terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `j` do not change as the program halts execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and the program has exited.**
