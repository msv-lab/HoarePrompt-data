According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is the current index within the range of `m`. Since `m` is greater than 0, this means the loop has executed at least once, and `j` has been incremented by 1. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, which means if it was `j` at the end of the last iteration, it will now be `j + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `j + 1`.**
