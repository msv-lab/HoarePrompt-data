Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1`, `B[i][1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `B[i][1]` and `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `y2`, then `B[i][1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `B[i][1]` and `y1`. If the sets are equal, no changes are made.***
