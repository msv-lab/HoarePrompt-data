Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 12. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed before exiting. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, and `x2, y2` is assigned the value of `b[j]`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed before exiting. Otherwise, `A[2][0]` is increased by 1, `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, and `x2, y2` is assigned the value of `b[j]` where `j` is updated to `j + 1.***
