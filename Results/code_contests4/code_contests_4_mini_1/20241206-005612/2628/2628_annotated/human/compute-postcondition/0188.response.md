Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `b[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`, the sets formed from `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and execution is terminated. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
