The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, the values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, and `-1` is printed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, and `-1` is printed.**
