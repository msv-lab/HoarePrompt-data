According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 12. To execute the loop for a third time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
