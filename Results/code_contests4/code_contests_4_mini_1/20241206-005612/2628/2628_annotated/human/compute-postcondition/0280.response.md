The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are modified or returned since the program ends execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[j]`, and -1 is printed before termination.
