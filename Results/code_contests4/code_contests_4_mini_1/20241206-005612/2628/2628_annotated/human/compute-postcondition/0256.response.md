Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned from `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[0]`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, then if either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, then `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If neither condition holds (i.e., if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`), and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, no changes are made to `B[i]`. Otherwise, if the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are equal, no operations are performed and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
