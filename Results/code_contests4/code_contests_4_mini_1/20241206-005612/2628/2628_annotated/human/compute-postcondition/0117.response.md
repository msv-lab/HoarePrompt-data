Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[2]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, the program checks if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`; if so, `-1` is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and not equal to `y2`, it checks if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`; if so, `-1` is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
