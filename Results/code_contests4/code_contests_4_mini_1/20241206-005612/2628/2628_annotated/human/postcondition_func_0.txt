The function reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the number of distinct pairs of integers communicated by two participants. It processes these pairs to count successful matches based on specific conditions, returning the second integer of the last matched pair from the second participant if exactly one successful match is found in either participant's pairs; otherwise, it returns 0. If a conflict in matching occurs, it outputs -1 and exits the program. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on input read from standard input.
