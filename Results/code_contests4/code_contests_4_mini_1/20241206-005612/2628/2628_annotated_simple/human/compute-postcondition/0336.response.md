The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately, and no values of the variables are changed or returned. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the program has exited without any modifications to the existing variable states.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `j` is `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and the program has exited.**
