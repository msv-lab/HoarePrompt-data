Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, the variable `b` is a list, and the elements at index `i` of `b` are not equal to the elements at index `j` of undefined variable `a`. The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the elements of `a` at index `j` which is currently undefined, thus causing an error or exception.**
