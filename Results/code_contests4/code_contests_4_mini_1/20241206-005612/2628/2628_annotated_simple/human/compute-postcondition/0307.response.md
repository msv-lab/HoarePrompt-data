The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `B[i][0]` is unknown, but its count of successful updates will now be one greater. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is updated by 1, `B[i][1]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` hold values from `a[0]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor `y2`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is either 0 or equal to `y1`.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is updated by 1, `B[i][1]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` hold values from `a[0]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor `y2`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is either 0 or equal to `y1`.**
