Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits without further execution. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
