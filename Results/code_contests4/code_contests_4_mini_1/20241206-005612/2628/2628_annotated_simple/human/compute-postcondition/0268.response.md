Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list, and an error or exception occurs due to accessing the undefined variable `a`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed, and the program exits. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, an error occurs as well when attempting to access `B[i][0]` due to the undefined variable `a`.***
