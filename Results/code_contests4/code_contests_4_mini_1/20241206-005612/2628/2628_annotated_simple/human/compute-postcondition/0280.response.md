The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and the program does not proceed further. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `b` is a list, and the program exits without further execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `b` is a list, and the program exits without further execution.**
