According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts indicates `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the first element of the list `a`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and that `j` is initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the first element of the list `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
