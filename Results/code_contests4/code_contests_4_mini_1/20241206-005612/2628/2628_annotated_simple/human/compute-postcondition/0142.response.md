Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. The sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is equal to `x1`. Conversely, if `x1` is not equal to `x2` and not equal to `y2`, and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the value -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If neither condition is met, no additional action occurs.***
