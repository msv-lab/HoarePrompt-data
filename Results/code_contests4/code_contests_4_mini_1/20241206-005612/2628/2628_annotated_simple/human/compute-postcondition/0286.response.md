Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `b` is a list. If `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, the program exits without further execution if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, or if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y2`. If neither of these conditions is met, an error occurs due to the undefined variable `B`, preventing any assignment.***
