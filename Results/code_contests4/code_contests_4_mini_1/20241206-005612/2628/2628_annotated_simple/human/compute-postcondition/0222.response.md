Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `2`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and program execution is terminated. Otherwise, `B[0][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[0][1]` is now equal to `x1`.***
