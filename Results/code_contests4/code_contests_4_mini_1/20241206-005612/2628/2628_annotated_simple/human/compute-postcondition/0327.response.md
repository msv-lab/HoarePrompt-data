Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates; if `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, then if `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, then `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, `j` is set to `k + 1`, and `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`. If `y1` equals either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `y1`, then `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`, `j` is set to `k + 1`, and `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`.***
