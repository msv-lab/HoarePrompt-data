Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` holds the count of successful updates, `A` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `Ai` is the second element of `A`. If the first element of `Ai` is equal to 1, then `ans` is the second element of `Ai`. If the first element of `Ai` is not equal to 1, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
