Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates; if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, `j` is `k + 1`, and `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`.***
