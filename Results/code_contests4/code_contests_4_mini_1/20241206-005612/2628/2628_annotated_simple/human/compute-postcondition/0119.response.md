According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**.
