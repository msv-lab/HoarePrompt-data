Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the first element of the list `a`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, and the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `y2`, and if either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is set to `y1`.***
