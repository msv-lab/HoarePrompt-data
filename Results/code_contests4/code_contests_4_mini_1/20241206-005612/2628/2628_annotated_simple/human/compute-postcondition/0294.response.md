Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`. The set of values in `B[i]` is different from the set of values in `a[j]`. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `B[i][1]` is not 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`.***
