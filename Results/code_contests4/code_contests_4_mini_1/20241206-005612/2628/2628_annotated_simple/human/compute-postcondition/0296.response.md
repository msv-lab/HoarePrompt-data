The execution of the code results in an exit from the current program. No variables are modified or returned, but the program terminates. Therefore, the output state is: `B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`. The set of values in `B[i]` is different from the set of values in `a[j]`. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `B[i][1]` is not 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`. The output of the print statement is -1, and we exit the program.
