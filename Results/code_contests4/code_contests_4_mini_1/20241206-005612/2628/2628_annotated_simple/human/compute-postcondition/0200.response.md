Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, and `x2` and `y2` are the values from the `a` list at index `0`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1` (or `y1`), then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x2`, then `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If neither `x1` nor `y1` are equal to `x2` or `y2`, then `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]` remain unchanged. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are equal, no changes occur in `B[i][0]` or `B[i][1]`.***
