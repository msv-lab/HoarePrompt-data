`ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]`, which indicates the second element of `Bi`. Since `B` contains at least two elements, `Bi` must also contain at least two elements. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` contains at least two elements, `Bi` is the second element of `B`, and `ans` is `Bi[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` contains at least two elements, `Bi` is the second element of `B`, `ans` is `Bi[1]**
