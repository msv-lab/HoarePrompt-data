According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will now be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`.**
