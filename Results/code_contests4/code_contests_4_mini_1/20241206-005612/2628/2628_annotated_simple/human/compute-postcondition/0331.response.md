The code `exit()` is called, which causes the program to terminate immediately. No values of the variables are changed or affected by this command. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of the variables, and we note that the program exits.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates; `j` is `k + 1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]` and the program exits.**
