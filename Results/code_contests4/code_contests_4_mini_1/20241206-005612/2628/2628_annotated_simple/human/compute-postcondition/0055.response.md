The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the first element of the list `a`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, and -1 is printed before exiting.
