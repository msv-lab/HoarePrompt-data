The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The initial state specifies that `y1` is the value from the `b` list at index `0`. Other variables such as `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output states of the relevant variables remain unchanged, and the state of `B[i][1]` is now known.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `2`; `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
