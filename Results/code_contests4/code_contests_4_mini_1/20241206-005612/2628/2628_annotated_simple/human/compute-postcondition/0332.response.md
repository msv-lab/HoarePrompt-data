The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, increasing the count of successful updates. The other variables `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates incremented by 1, `j` is `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates incremented by 1, `j` is `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`**
