Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `b` is a list. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program terminates with an output of -1. Otherwise, an error occurs because `B[i][0]` cannot be accessed due to the undefined variable `a`.***
