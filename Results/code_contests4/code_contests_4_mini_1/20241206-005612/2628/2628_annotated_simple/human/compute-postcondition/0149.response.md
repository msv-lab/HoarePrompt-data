The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous value of `x1` is taken from `a[2]`, but since the specific value of `a[2]` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `x1`. Other variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A[i][1]` has been updated but does not provide a specific value for `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` is a[2], `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of b[1], and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
