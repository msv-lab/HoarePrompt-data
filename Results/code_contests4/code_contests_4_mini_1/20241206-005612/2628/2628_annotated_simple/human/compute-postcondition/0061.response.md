Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the first element of the list `a`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If neither condition is satisfied, and if `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed before exiting; otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no actions are taken.***
