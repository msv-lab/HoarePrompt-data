Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `x1`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
