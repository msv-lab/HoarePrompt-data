Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[1]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed before exiting the program. Otherwise, `A[2][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
