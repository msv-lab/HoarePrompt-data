Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, if `A[i][1]` is equal to `x1`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 has been printed and program execution is terminated; otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then there are no changes made to `A[i][1]`.***
