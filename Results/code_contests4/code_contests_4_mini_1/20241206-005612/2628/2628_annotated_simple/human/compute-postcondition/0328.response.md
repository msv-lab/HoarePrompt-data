According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to some value less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if `j` is currently `k`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `j` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `k + 1`**
