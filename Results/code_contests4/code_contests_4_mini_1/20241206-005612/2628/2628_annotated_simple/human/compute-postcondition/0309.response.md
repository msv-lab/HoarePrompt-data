Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`, and `n` is greater than 0. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is updated by 1, `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`, while `x2` and `y2` hold values from `a[0]`, and `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`. Furthermore, `x1` remains neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and the set of values in `B[i]` is different from that in `a[j]`.***
