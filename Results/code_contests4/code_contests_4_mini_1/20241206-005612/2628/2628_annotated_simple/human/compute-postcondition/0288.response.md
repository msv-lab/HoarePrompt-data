According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i` in relation to `m`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2.**
