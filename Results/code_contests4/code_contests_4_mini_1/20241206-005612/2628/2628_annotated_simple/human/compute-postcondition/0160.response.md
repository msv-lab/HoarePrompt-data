The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. Since `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` will take on the values of `b[2]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[2]**
