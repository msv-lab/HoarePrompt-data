Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, the sets created from `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `A[i][1]` is equal to `x1`.***
