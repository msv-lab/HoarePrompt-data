The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of `B[i][0]`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `j` is `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` hold the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `j` is `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.**
