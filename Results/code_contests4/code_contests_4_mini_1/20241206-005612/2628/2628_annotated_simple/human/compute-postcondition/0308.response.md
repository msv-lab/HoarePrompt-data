The code assigns the value of `y1` to `B[i][1]`. The previous state indicates that `B[i][1]` is either 0 or equal to `y1`, so after execution, `B[i][1]` will now hold the value of `y1`. The values of `B[i][0]`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is updated by 1, `B[i][1]` is equal to `y1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` hold values from `a[0]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor `y2`, and `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is updated by 1, `B[i][1]` is equal to `y1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` hold values from `a[0]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor `y2`, and `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`.**
