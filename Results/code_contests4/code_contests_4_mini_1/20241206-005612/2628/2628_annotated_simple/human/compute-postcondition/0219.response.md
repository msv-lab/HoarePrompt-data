The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no variables are modified or returned, and the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any changes. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `2`, and -1 is printed; program execution has been terminated.**
