The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `j`, where `j` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `x2` and `y2` will now hold the values from `a[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the output state reflects the new values of `x2` and `y2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `2`.**
