Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `y1`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`, `j` is `k + 1`, and `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`.***
