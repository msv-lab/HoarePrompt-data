Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, and `x2`, `y2` now hold the values from `b[j]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no changes occur in the program state. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no changes occur in the program state.***
