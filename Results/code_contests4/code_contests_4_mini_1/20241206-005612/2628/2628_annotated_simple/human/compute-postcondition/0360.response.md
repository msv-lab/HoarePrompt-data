Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` contains at least one element. If the first element of `Bi` is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]`, and `Bi` is the first element of `B` in the loop with the first element of `Bi` equal to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
