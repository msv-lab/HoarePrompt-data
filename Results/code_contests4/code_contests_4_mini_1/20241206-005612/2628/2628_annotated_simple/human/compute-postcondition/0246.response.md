Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; the variable `b` is a list such that the set of its element at index `i` is not equal to the set of the undefined variable `a` at index `j`. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`. Furthermore, `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`.***
