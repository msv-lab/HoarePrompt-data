The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. Since the program raised an error or exception due to the undefined variable `a`, the output is -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is stopped. Therefore, the Output State is: the program is terminated with an output of -1 due to the error.

Output State: **the program is terminated with an output of -1 due to the error**
