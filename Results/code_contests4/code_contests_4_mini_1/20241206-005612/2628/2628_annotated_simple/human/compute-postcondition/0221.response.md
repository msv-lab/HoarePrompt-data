The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The current value of `i` is 0, so this means `B[0][1]` is being set to the value of `x1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `2`, `B[0][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[0][1]` is now equal to `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `2`, `B[0][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[0][1]` is now equal to `x1`.**
