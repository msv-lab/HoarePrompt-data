The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change because the program execution is halted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `b` is a list, and the program has been exited without any further changes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `b` is a list, and the program has been exited.**
