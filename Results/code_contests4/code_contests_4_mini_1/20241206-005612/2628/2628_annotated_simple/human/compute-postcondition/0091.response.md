The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change as the program execution is halted. The output state reflects the current values of the variables and indicates that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, and `x2`, `y2` now hold the values from `b[j]`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
