The code assigns the values of `b[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. Given that `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` will take the values from the array `b` at index 1. The previous values of `x1` and `y1` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the assignment of `x2` and `y2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[1]`.**
