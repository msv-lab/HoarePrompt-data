The execution of the code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as there is no assignment or operation performed on them before the exit. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the first element of the list `a`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]` and -1 is printed, and we exit the program.
