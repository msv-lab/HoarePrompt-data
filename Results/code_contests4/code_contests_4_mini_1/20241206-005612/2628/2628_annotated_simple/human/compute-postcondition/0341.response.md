Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
