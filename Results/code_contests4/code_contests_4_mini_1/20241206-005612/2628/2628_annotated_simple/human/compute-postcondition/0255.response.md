Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; the variable `b` is a list such that the set of its elements at index `i` is not equal to the set of the undefined variable `a` at index `j`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated to the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, then if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is now equal to `y1`, and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, no changes are made to `B[i][1]` or `B[i][0]`.***
