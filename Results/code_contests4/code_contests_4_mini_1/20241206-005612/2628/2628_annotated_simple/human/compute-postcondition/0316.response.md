The execution of the `exit()` command terminates the program immediately. No variables are modified, and the program does not return any values or change the state of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates; `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`; `j` is k + 1; `x2, y2` is assigned the values from `a[j]`; -1 is printed, and the program has exited.
