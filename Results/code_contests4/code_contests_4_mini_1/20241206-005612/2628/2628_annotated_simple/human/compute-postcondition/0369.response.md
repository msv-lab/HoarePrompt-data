Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` holds the count of successful updates and the last assigned values for each index based on the comparisons of elements in `b` and `a`. The sum of the first elements of `A` across indices from 0 to n is not equal to 1 and the sum of the first elements of `B` across indices from 0 to m is not equal to 1.***
