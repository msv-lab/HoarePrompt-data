According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1, which means for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from the first element of the list `a`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]` for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2.**
