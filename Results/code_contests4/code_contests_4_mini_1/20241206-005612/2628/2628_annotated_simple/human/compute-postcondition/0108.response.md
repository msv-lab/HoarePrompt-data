The value of `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous state of `x1` is known as it is assigned from `a[1]`, and the values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
