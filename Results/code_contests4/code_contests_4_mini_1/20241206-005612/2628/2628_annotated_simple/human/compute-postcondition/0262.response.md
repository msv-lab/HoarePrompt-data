Given the initial state, the code attempts to assign a value `x1` to `B[i][1]`. However, an error occurs because the variable `B` is undefined due to the prior undefined variable `a`. As a result, the assignment cannot be completed and thus the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, the variable `b` is a list, and an error occurs because `B[i][0]` cannot be accessed due to the undefined variable `a`.**
