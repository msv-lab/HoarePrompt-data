Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, the sets created from `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, `x1` is not equal to `x2`, `x1` is not equal to `y2`, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 has been printed and program execution is terminated. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
