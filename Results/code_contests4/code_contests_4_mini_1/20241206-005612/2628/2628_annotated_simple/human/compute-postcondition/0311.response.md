Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`, and `n` is greater than 0. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is set to `x1`, while maintaining the previous conditions on `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is updated by 1, `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`, and the values of `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged from `a[0]`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, the program continues with no changes made.***
