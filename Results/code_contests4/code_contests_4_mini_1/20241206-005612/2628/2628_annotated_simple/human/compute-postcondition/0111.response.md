The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change due to this termination. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, and -1 has been printed. The program exits without further execution.
