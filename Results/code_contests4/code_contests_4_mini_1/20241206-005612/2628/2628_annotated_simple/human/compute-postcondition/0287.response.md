To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we begin with the initial state and analyze the provided loop code. 

Initially, we have the following conditions:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates based on comparisons of `b[i]` and elements in `a`.
- `B[i][1]` holds the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1` according to the conditions.
- `x1` is assigned the value of `b[i][0]`.
- `y1` is assigned the value of `b[i][1]`.

The loop will iterate `n` times, and on each iteration, it checks the values of `b[i]` against `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. The conditions check for matches and update `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]` accordingly, or print -1 and exit if certain conditions are not met.

After the loop executes all `n` times:
1. If `set(b[i])` is not equal to any `set(a[j])`, `B[i][0]` will have been incremented based on successful matches found, and `B[i][1]` will either hold the last valid value assigned from `x1` or `y1`.
2. If at any point the conditions to print -1 are met, the program would exit before completing all iterations.

Assuming the loop executes without printing -1, the final output state will reflect the total successful updates made, which is captured in `B[i][0]`, and the last assigned value will be in `B[i][1]`. 

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
Output State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1` after all iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations, and `i` remains 1.**
