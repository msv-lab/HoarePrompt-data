Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are the values assigned from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are the values assigned from the `a` list at index `0`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, and it is not the case that `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`; -1 has been returned and we exit the program.**
