Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `b` is a list. If `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, the program checks if `b[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`; if so, it terminates with an output of -1. Otherwise, an error occurs due to the attempt to access `b[i][0]` because of the undefined variable `a`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, an error or exception occurs due to accessing the undefined variable `a`. If `b[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed, and the program exits. If `b[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, an error occurs when attempting to access `b[i][0]` due to the undefined variable `a`. If `set(b[i])` is equal to `set(a[j])`, there is no action taken in the else part.***
