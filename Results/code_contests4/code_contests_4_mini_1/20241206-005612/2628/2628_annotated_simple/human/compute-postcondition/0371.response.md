Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `B` holds the count of successful updates and the last assigned values for each index based on the comparisons of elements in `b` and `a`. If the sum of the first elements in `A` equals 1 or the sum of the first elements in `B` equals 1, then `ans` is the second element of the last element in `B` where the first element is equal to 1 (or remains unchanged if no such element exists), and `ans` is printed. Otherwise, the output is 0.***
