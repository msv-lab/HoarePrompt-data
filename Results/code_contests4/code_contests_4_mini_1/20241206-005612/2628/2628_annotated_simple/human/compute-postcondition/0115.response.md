Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
