Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. The sets formed by the elements of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, `x1` is not equal to `x2`, `x1` is not equal to `y2`, and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or `A[i][1]` is equal to `y1`; `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
