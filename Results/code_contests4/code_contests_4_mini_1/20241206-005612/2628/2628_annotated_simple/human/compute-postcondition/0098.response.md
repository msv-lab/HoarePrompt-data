`A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The previous state indicates that `y1` holds a value assigned from `a[1]`, and the values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, and `x2`, `y2` now hold the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1; `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, and `x2`, `y2` now hold the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1; `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
