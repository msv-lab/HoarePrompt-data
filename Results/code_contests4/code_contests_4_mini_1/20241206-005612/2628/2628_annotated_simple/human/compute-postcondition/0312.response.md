Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`, `n` is greater than 0, and if `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is set to `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is updated by 1 and `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no changes are made. If `set(b[i])` is equal to `set(a[j])`, no actions are taken.***
