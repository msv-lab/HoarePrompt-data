Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` hold values from `b[2]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and execution is terminated. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If the first condition does not hold, and if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, the program does not execute any actions.***
