Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `1`. If the sets of `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, the program checks several conditions involving `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` and updates `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]` accordingly. If the specified exit conditions are not met, the values in `B[i]` are modified based on the comparisons of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. If the sets are equal, no changes are made to `B[i]`.***
