Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `b` is a list. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, the program exits without further execution. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y2`, the program exits without further execution. Otherwise, an error occurs because the variable `B` is not defined, preventing any assignment.***
