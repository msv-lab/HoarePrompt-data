The code executes a print statement which outputs `-1`. This does not change the values of any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are assigned values from `a[1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, and `x2`, `y2` now hold the values from `b[j]`.**
