Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are the values assigned from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are the values assigned from the `a` list at index `0`, the set of `b[i]` is not equal to the set of `a[j]`, and it is not the case that `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the function returns -1 and exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is neither equal to `x2` nor `y2`, the program continues without any changes to `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]`.***
