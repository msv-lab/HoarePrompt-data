Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[1]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y1`, then if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed before exiting the program; otherwise, `A[2][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[2][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
