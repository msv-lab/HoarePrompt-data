Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits after assigning `x2` and `y2` the values from `a[j]`. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `k + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
