Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are the values from the `b` list at index `0`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `a` list at index `2`. If the sets of values at `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and program execution is terminated; otherwise, `B[0][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[0][1]` is now equal to `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and execution is terminated; otherwise, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the sets of values at `b[i]` and `a[j]` are equal, there are no changes made to the values of `B`.***
