The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates based on pre-defined constraints: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12, and it processes two sets of pairs of distinct integers. The first set contains `n` pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 9, while the second set contains `m` pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 9. Each pair from the first set shares exactly one number with a pair from the second set.

Given the output description is missing, I will proceed with the provided constraints to infer the functionality based on the implication of the input sets.

Functionality: **The function processes two sets of pairs of distinct integers, where each set contains integers between 1 and 9, and determines the shared number between them.**
