`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The variable `B[i][0]` is not affected by this operation, and its previous value is the count of successful updates increased by 1. The value of `B[i][1]` changes to `y1` based on the last assignment. The values of `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is `y1`; `j` is k + 1; `x2, y2` is assigned the values from `a[j]`.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is `y1`; `j` is `k + 1`; `x2, y2` is assigned the values from `a[j]`.**
