Postcondition: ***`B[i][0]` is the count of successful updates, `B[i][1]` is the last assigned value from either `x1` or `y1`, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, and the set of values in `B[i]` is different from the set of values in `a[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the output of the print statement is -1, and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is now `x1`, with `n` still greater than 0, maintaining the values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` as previously described.***
