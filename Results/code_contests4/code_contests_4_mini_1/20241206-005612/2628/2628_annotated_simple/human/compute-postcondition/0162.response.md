The code `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program ends. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[2]`, and -1 has been printed.
