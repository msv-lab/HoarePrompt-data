According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `B`. If `B` contains at least two elements, the loop will execute again for the second element of `B`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `B` has at least one element (the first element being `Bi`), and `ans` is updated if the first element of `Bi` is equal to 1. 

Since the loop processes each element in `B`, for the loop to execute one more time, `Bi` will need to be the next element in the list `B`. If `B` has at least two elements, then `Bi` will become the second element of `B`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` contains at least two elements, `Bi` is the second element of `B`**
