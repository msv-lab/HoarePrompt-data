Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `b` is a list. If the condition `B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != x1` is true, the program has exited. Otherwise, an error occurs because the variable `B` is not defined, preventing any assignment to `B[i][1]` while maintaining `n` as an integer greater than 1, `i` as 1, `j` as 2, and `b` as a list.***
