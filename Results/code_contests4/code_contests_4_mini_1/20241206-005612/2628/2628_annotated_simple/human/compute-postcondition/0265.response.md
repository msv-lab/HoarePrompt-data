Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list, elements at index `i` of `b` are not equal to the elements at index `j` of undefined variable `a`, and an error or exception occurs due to accessing undefined variable `a`; therefore, -1 is printed, and the program exits.**
