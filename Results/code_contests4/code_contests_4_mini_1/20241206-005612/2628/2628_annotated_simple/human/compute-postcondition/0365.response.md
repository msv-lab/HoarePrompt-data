`ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]`, which refers to the second element of the list `B`. The initial state mentions that `B` contains at least two elements, confirming that `Bi` is valid. The other variables (`n` and `m`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` contains at least two elements, `Bi` is the second element in `B`, and `ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `B` contains at least two elements, `Bi` is the second element in `B`, and `ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]`**.
