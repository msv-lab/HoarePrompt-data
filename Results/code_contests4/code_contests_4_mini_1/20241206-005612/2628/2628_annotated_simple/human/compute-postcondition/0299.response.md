The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous value of `B[i][1]` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is now `x1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, and the set of values in `B[i]` is different from the set of values in `a[j]`.

Output State: **`B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is now `x1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, and the set of values in `B[i]` is different from the set of values in `a[j]`.**
