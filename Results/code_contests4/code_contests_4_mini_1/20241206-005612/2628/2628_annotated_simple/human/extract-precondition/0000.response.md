Precondition: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12, the first set contains n pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 9, and the second set contains m pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 9. Each pair contains two different numbers, and there is exactly one number shared between a pair from the first set and a pair from the second set.**
