According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is between 1 and 12, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, it will become 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.**
