The code `exit()` is invoked, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged as the program exits before any further operations can be conducted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1; values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the tuple `a` at index `j`; -1 is printed, and the program exits.
