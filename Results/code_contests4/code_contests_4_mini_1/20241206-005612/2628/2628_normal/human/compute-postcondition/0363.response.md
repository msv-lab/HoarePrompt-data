Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `A` is a list with at least `n` elements, `ans` holds the value of the last `A[i][1]` where `A[i][0]` equals 1 or remains undefined if no such element exists, `B` is a list with at least 1 element, and `i` is equal to the length of `A`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `B` must have at least 2 elements. If `Bi[0]` equals 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
