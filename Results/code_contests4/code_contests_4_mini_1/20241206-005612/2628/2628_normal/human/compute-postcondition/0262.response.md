The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are 1, and `B[1][0]` is increased by 1, but we do not have information about `x1`. The state of `B[i][1]` will depend on the value of `x1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1; `B[1][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `B[1][0]` is increased by 1; `B[1][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
