The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, while `A[i][0]` has been previously increased by 1. Since `y1` was not specified in the initial state, we acknowledge that its value is unknown. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `i` is either 1 or 2; `m` must be greater than `j`; `j` is `j + 1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` has been increased by 1; `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` (unknown).

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `i` is either 1 or 2; `m` must be greater than `j`; `j` is `j + 1`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` has been increased by 1; `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1` (unknown)**.
