The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The previous values of the variables `B`, `y1`, and the specific value of `B[i][1]` depend on the context, but we know that `B[i][0]` has already been increased by 1.

Since `y1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output state must reflect the information we have.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
