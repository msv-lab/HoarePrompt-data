Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a` at index `i`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. The sets of values from `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. Neither `x1` is equal to `x2` nor `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
