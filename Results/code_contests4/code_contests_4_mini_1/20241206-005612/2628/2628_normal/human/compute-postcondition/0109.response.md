Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1` while `x2` and `y2` are still assigned the values from `b[j]`.***
