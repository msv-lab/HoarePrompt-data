The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and no further code is executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` must be greater than `j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and -1 is printed.
