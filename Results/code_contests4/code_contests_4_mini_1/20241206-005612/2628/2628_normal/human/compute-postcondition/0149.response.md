The value of `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous value of `A[i][1]` is the last assigned value of `x1`, `y1`, or it remains unchanged. The values of `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and the nature of the sets in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `A[i][1]`.

Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is one greater than its previous value, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal.**
