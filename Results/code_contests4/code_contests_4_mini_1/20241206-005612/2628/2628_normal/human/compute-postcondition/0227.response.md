Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the value `-1` has been printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 1, `j` remains 1, values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the tuple `a` at index `j`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
