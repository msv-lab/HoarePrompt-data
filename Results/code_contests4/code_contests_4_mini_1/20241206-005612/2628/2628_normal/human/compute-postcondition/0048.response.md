The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, where `j` is 2. Therefore, `x2` takes the value from `b[2]` and `y2` takes the value from `b[3]`. The current values of `x1`, `y1`, `n`, `i` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 2, `x2` is the value from `b[1]`, `y2` is the value from `b[2]`**.
