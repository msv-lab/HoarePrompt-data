Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[1]`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed to the output and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
