Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and if `x1` equals `x2` or `x1` equals `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` does not equal `x2` and does not equal `y2`, then if `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 was printed before termination; otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is now `y1`.***
