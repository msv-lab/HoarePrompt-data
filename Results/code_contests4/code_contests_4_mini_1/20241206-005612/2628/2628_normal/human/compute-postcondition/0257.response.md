According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `n` is between 1 and 12, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
