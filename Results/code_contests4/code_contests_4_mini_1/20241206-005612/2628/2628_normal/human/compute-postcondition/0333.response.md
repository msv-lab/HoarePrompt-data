The code assigns the value of `x1` to `B[i][1]`. The variable `i` is 2, so `B[2][1]` is updated to the value of `x1`. The values of the other variables `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[2][0]` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, `B[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, `B[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
