The execution of the code snippet `exit()` leads to the termination of the program, and no changes are made to any of the variables. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. The output also indicates that `-1` is printed prior to the exit, but the exit command itself does not affect the variable states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.**
