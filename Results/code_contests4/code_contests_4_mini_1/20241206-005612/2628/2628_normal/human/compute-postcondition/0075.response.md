Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from `a` at index `i`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and the sets of values from `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
