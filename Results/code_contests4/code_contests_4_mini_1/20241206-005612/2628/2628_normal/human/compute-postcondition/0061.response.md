Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12. If `set(a[i])` is not equal to `set(b[j])`, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `i` is updated to 1, and `A[1][1]` is set to `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `i` is incremented to 1, and `A[1][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
