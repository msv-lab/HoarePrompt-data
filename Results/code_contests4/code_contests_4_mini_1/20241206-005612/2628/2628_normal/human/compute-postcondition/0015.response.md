The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, as the program does not proceed past the `exit()` command. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, and -1 is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, and -1 is printed.**
