Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is assigned the value of `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[1]`. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `x1`, the program is terminated. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
