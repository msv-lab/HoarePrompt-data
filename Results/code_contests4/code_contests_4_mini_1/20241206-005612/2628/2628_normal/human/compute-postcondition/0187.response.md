`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous value of `B[i][1]` could either be 0 or `x1` itself, but now it is set to the value of `x1`, which remains unchanged. The other variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`; the sets of elements in `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`; `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`; the sets of elements in `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`; `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
