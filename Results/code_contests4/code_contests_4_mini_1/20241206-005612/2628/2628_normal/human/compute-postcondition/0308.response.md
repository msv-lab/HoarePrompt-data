The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The prior values of the variables do not affect the assignment, but we know that `y1` is either equal to `x2` or `y2`. The value of `B[i][1]` will now reflect the value of `y1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[0]`; the set of `b[2]` is not equal to the set of `a[0]`; `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`; `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
