Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12 and `m` is greater than or equal to 0. If either the sum of the first elements of `A` across the range of `n` or the sum of the first elements of `B` across the range of `m` equals 1, then `ans` holds the value of the last `B[i][1]` where `B[i][0]` equals 1, or remains undefined if no such element exists. Otherwise, the sum of the first elements of `A` across the range of `n` is not equal to 1, the sum of the first elements of `B` across the range of `m` is not equal to 1, and the value 0 has been printed.***
