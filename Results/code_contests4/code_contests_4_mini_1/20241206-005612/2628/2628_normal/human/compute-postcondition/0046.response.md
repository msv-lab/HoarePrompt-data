Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1]`, and `y2` is `b[2]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, the program will print -1 and terminate if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, otherwise, `A[0][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[0][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, the program will print -1 if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value from `a[0]`. If `y1` is not equal to either `x2` or `y2`, there is no effect on the program state.***
