Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1]`, `y2` is `b[2]`. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value from `a[0]`.***
