Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is updated to `x1`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.***
