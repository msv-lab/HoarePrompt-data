The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` do not change as the program execution is halted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed before termination.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed before termination.**
