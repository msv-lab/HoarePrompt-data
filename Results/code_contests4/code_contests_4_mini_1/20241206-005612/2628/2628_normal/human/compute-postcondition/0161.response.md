The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` but does not change any of the previous variable states. The states of `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of either `x1` or `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is -1.

Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of either `x1` or `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is -1.**
