The value of `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The previous value of `y1` is not specified, but it is mentioned that `y1` is assigned from `b[0]`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and the conditions regarding `b[i]` and `a[j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment to `B[i][1]`.

Output State: **`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`**
