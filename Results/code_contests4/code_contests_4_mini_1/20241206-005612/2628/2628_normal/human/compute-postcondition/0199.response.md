Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`; the sets of elements in `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is now equal to `x1` and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x1` is not equal to `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program has exited; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the program continues without any changes to `B[i][1]`.***
