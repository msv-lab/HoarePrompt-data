Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
