The code prints `-1`, which does not change any variable values but indicates an output. The values of the variables `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `i`, `A[i][0]`, `A[i][1]`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found, `A[i][1]` is the last assigned value of `x1` or `y1` or remains unchanged if no matches were valid, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal; `-1` is printed.
