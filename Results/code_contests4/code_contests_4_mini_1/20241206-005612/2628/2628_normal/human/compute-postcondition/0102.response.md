Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1 with `x2` and `y2` assigned the values from `b[j]`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, then if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is updated to `x1`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no changes occur.***
