The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. Since the values of the variables do not change due to the termination of the program, the output state reflects the current state of the variables before the program exits. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`; the sets of elements in `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`; and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`; -1 is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`; the sets of elements in `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`; and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`; -1 is printed.**
