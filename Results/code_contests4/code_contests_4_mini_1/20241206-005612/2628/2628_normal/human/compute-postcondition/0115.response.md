Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. If `y1` equals `x2` or `y1` equals `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 was printed before termination. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is now `y1`.***
