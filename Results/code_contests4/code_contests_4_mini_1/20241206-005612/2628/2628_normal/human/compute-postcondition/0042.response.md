The variable `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Given that `y1` is equal to the value of `a[0]`, the state of `A[i][1]` will now hold that same value. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1]`, `y2` is `b[2]`, and `A[i][1]` is the value from `a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1]`, `y2` is `b[2]`, and `A[i][1]` is the value from `a[0]**
