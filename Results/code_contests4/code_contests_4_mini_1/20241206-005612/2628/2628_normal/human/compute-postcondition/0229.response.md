Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12 and `m` is greater than 0. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 1, `j` remains 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the tuple `a` at index `j`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`.***
