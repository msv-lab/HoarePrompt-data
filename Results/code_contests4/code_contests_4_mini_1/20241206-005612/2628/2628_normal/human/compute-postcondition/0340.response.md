Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to either `x2` or `y2`, no changes occur in `B[i]`.***
