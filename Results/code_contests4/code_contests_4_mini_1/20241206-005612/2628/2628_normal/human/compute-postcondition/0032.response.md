According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the total number of iterations defined by `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1.**
