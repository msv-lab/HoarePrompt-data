Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`. The set of values in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of values in `b[j]`, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
