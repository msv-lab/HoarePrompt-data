The `exit()` command is invoked, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and the execution of any further code does not occur. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of either `x1` or `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is -1, but the program is exited before any of this can affect the state further.

Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of either `x1` or `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is -1; the program is exited.**
