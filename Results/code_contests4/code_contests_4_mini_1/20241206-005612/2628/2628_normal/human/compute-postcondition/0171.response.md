Postcondition: ***`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3. If `y1` equals either `x2` or `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of either `x1` or `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, `j` is 2, and -1 is printed, exiting the program. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If `y1` does not equal `x2` or `y2`, the program does not execute any additional operations.***
