According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, meaning that it is now equal to the previous value of `j + 1`, and `m` is greater than `j`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be set to the value of the previous iteration plus 1, and `m` must still be greater than this new value of `j`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1, if it was previously at `j`, it should now be `j + 1`. We also know that `m` is greater than this new `j`. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, we can define the new state.

State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1`**
