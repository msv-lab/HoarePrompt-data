The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately, and there are no changes to the variable values. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values without any modifications. The program exits without returning any specific values.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, `x1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, the value of `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is also not equal to `x1`; printed output is -1.**
