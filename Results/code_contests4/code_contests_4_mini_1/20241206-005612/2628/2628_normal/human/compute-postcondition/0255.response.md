Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`; if `x1` is either `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`. If `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor to `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If the condition is false, there are no changes to the variables.***
