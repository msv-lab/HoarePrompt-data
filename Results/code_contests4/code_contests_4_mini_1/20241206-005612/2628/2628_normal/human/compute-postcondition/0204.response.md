The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, but the execution of the program stops. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[1]`, and the program is terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[1]`, and the program is terminated.**
