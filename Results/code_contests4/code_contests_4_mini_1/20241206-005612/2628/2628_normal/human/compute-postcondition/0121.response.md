To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The variable `m` determines how many times the loop will run. If `m` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute at all.
2. The variables `n`, `i`, `A`, `x1`, and `y1` are provided, but they do not directly influence the execution of this loop. They may impact what happens inside the loop, but they do not affect whether the loop runs.
3. The only crucial variable for the loop's execution is `m`. 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `m` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found, `A[i][1]` is the last assigned value of `x1` or `y1` or remains unchanged if no matches were valid, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0.**
