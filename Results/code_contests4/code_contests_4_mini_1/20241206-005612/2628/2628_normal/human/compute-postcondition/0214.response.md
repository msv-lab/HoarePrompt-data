Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is assigned the value of `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[1]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program terminates; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program exits; otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no changes occur in this block.***
