The statement `A[i][1] = y1` assigns the value of `y1` to the second element of the `i`th row of the 2D list `A`. The variable `y1` holds the value from `a[0]`, which is unaffected by this operation. The other variables, `n`, `i`, `x1`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2`, also remain unchanged by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
