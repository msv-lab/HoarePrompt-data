The value of `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `A[i][0]` is not specified, but it will be increased by 1 regardless of its initial value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, and `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
