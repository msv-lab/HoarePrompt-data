The code snippet prints `-1`. The values of the variables do not change as there are no assignments or operations modifying them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, where `a` is an array or list. The set of elements in `b[1]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[0]`. `x1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`. The value of `B[i][1]` is not 0 and is also not equal to `x1`; printed output is -1.**
