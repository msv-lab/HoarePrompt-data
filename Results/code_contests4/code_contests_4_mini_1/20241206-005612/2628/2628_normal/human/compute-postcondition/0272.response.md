According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is between 1 and 12, meaning `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. 

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
