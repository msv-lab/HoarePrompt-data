Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is set to the value from `a[0]`.***
