Postcondition: ***`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found, `A[i][1]` is the last assigned value of `x1` or `y1` or remains unchanged if no matches were valid, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the output is -1 and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is set to `y1` with either `A[i][1]` equal to 0 or previously equal to `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, the program continues without changes to the state.***
