The code contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of `ans`. The previous state indicates that `ans` holds the value of the last `Bi[1]` where `Bi[0]` equals 1 or remains undefined if no such element exists. Since no value is assigned to `ans` in this snippet, we simply output its current value.

If `ans` is defined, it will be printed; if it remains undefined, that condition will also be reflected in the output state.

Output State: **`ans` holds the value of the last `Bi[1]` where `Bi[0]` equals 1 or remains undefined if no such element exists.**
