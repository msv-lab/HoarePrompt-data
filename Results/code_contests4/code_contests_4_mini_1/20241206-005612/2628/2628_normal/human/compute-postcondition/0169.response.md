The value of `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, this assignment affects either `A[2][1]` or `A[3][1]` depending on the value of `i`. The values of `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `A[i][0]`, `m`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3; `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3; `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, `m` remains greater than 2, `j` is 2.**
