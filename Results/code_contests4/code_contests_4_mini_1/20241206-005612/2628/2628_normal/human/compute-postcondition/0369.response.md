Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `m` is greater than or equal to 0; `B[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found for each pair in `a`; `B[i][1]` holds the last assigned value of either `x1` or `y1` for each pair, or remains 0 if no matches were found; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop concludes; `x1` and `y1` are the last assigned values from `b[m-1]` if `m` is greater than 0, otherwise they remain undefined if `m` is 0. The sum of the first elements of `A` across the range of `n` is not equal to 1, and the sum of the first elements of `B` across the range of `m` is not equal to 1.***
