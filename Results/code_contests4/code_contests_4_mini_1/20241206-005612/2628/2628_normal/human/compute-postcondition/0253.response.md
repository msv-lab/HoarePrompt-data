Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of elements in `b[1]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[0]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, and `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
