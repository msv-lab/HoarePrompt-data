The code snippet `x2, y2 = b[j]` assigns the values from `b[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. The variable `j` is currently 0, so the values assigned to `x2` and `y2` will be those found at the first index of the list `b`. The variables `n`, `i`, `x1`, and `y1` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`**
