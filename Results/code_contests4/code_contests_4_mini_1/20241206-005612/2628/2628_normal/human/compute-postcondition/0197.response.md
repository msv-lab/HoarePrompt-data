Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[0]`; the sets of elements in `b[i]` and `a[j]` are not equal; either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x1` is not equal to `y2`; and either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
