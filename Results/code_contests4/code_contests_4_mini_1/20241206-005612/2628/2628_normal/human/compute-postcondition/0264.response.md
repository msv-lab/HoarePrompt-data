The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.**
