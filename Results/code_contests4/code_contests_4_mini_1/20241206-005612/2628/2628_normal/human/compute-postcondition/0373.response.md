Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of pairs of distinct integers communicated by two participants, and processes these pairs. It counts valid matches between the pairs while ensuring no duplicates in terms of matching criteria. If exactly one valid match is found among the pairs for either participant, it returns the last integer associated with that match. If there are no valid matches or more than one valid match, it returns 0. The function also prints -1 and exits if any pair violates the matching rules, indicating an inconsistency in the input pairs. **
