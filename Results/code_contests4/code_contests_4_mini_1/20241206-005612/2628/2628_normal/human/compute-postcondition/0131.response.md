Postcondition: ***`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[0]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is the count of valid matches found, `A[i][1]` is the last assigned value of `x1` or `y1` or remains unchanged if no matches were valid, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal, and either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is now equal to `x1`.***
