The code prints the value `-1`, which does not change any variable states, but outputs `-1` as a result. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.**
