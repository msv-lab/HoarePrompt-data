Postcondition: ***`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[1]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, and the sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and does not equal `x1`, `-1` is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, `m` remains greater than 1, and `j` is 1.***
