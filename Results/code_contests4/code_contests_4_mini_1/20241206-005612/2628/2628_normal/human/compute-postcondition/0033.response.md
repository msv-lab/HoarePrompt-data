The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the list `b` at indices `j` and `j + 1`, respectively. Given that `j` is currently 1, `x2` will be assigned the value of `b[1]`, and `y2` will be assigned the value of `b[2]`. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignments of `x2` and `y2` based on the list `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1]`, `y2` is `b[2]`**
