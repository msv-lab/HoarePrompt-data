Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[1][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits without affecting the variables. Otherwise, `B[1][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[1][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[1][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, `-1` is printed before termination. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
