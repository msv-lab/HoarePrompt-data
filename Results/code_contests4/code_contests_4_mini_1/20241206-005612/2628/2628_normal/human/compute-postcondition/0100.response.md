Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12; `i` is either 1 or 2; `m` is greater than `j`; `j` is incremented by 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
