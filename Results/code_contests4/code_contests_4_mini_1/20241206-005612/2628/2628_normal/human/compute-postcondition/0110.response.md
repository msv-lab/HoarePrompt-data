The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` to the console. The previous values of the variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`) are not changed by this statement, and it does not affect their state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and -1 is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and -1 is printed.**
