The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The previous states of the affected variables are `n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from `a[j]`, but we don't have specific values for `a` or `y1`. The operation does not affect `n`, `i`, or `j`, but it updates `B[i][1]`. Therefore, since we don't have information on `y1`, we can't specify a concrete output.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
