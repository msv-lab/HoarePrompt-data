Postcondition: ***`x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[2]`, `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 2 or 3, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits after printing -1; otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, with `m` remaining greater than 2 and `j` being 2.***
