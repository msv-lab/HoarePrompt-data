The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program execution is stopped. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `x2, y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, and -1 was printed before termination.
