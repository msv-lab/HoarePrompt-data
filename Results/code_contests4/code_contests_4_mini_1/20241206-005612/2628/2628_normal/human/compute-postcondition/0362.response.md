The code assigns the value of the second element of `Bi` to `ans`. Since `Bi` is the next element in `B`, and `B` has at least 2 elements (as required for the loop to execute a second time), `Bi` is defined and has at least two elements. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]`.

Output State: **`ans` is assigned the value of `Bi[1]**
