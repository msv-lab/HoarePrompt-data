The code snippet `print(-1)` outputs the value -1 to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, or `y2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with noting that the value -1 has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, which depends on the value of `a[1]`; -1 has been printed.**
