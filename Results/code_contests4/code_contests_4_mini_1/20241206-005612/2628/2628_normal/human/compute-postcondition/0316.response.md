The code executes the `exit()` function, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no variables are modified, and the program does not continue to any further statements or calculations. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, which depends on the value of `a[1]`; -1 is printed, and the program exits.
