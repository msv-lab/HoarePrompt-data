The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The previous value of `y1` is equal to `b[0]`. Therefore, after execution, `B[i][1]` will now hold the value of `b[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[0]`, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[1]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
