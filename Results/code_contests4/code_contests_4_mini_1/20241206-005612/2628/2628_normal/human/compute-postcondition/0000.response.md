The code assigns values to `n` and `m` as integers extracted from a single line of input, split by spaces and converted to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are integers within the range of 1 to 12. After execution, `n` and `m` will now hold the values provided by the input. The values of `n` and `m` are now specific integers based on the input, but their exact values are not provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers as per input, within the range of 1 to 12.**
