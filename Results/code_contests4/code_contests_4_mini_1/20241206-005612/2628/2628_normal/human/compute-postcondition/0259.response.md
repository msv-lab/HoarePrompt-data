The code simply prints `-1`, which does not change the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain the same as they were initially assigned. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[j]`, and `-1` is printed.**
