Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is not equal to `x2` or `y2`, no action is taken.***
