The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are changed, and the program stops execution. The output state reflects that the program has exited without altering any of the variable values. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the set of elements in `b[1]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[0]`, `x1` is neither equal to `x2` nor equal to `y2`, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `y1`; -1 is printed and the program exits.**
