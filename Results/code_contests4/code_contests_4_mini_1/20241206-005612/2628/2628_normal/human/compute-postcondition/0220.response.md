The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `B[i][0]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific new value of `B[i][0]`. However, the other variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.**
