According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1 and `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 12. 

If `i` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 0, which it is, and `i` will be incremented to 1. If `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Thus, if `i` is 0, the next state will have `i` as 1. If `i` is 1, the next state will have `i` as 2 (provided `n` is greater than 1). 

State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is either 1 or 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1 if `i` is 1**
