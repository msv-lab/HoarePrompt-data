Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 1, `x2` is `b[1]`, `y2` is `b[2]`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed; otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value from `a[0]`. If `y1` is not equal to either `x2` or `y2`, there is no effect on the program state.***
