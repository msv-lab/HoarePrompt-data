The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The value of `x1` can either be `x2` or `y2`, and since `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`, the exact value of `B[i][1]` depends on the value of `x1`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `B[i][0]` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`; `x1` is either `x2` or `y2`; `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 1; `j` is 0; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `a[0]`; `x1` is either `x2` or `y2`; `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`.**
