The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the tuple `a` at index `j`, and the value `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the tuple `a` at index `j`, and the value `-1` has been printed.**
