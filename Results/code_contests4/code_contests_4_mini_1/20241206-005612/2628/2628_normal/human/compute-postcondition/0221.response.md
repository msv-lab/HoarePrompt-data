The variable `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The initial state does not provide a value for `x1`, so we cannot determine its value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`.**
