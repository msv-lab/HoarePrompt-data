The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program halts before any further execution. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`, and -1 is printed.
