Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 12, `i` is 0, `x1` is the value from `a[0]`, `y1` is the value from `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `b`, `y2` is the second element of `b`. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal and if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then `A[i][1]` is either set to `a[0]` or -1 is printed based on the condition of `A[i][1]`. Similarly, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then `A[i][1]` is either assigned the value of `y1` or -1 is printed based on its condition. If neither `x1` nor `y1` matches `x2` or `y2`, no actions are taken. If the sets of `a[i]` and `b[j]` are equal, no changes occur.***
