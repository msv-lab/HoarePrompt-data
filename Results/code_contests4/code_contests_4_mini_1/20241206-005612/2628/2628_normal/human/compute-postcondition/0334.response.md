Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 2, `j` is 2; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`. If `B[2][1]` is not 0 and is not equal to `x1`, the program exits without any further changes to the variables. Otherwise, `B[2][0]` is increased by 1, and `B[2][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
