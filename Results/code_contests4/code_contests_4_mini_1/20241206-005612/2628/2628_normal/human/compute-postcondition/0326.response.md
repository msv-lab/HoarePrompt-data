Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, which depends on the value of `a[1]`. If `x1` equals `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` equals either `x2` or `y2`, and if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 has been printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` does not equal `x2` or `y2`, the program continues without any changes to `B[i][0]` or `B[i][1]`.***
