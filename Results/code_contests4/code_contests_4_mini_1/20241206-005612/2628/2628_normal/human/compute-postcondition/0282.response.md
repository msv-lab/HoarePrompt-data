The code assigns the value of `y1` to `B[i][1]`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are 1 and 2, respectively, but we do not have specific values for `B` or `y1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation without specific values.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 12, `i` is 1, `j` is 2; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.**
