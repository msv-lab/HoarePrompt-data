The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is halted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 12; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `a[j]`, which depends on the value of `a[1]`; -1 has been printed, and the program has exited.
