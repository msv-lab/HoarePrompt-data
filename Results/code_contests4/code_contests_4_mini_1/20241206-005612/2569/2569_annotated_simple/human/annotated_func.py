#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of schoolboys, m is a positive integer representing the number of bikes available for rent, a is a non-negative integer representing the shared budget, b is a list of n positive integers where each bi (1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4) represents the personal money of the i-th boy, and p is a list of m positive integers where each pj (1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9) represents the price of renting the j-th bike.
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `b` is the total number of bikes allocated, `left` is the remaining number of bikes, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer.
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns the updated value of b after subtracting left and the remaining number of bikes left
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `k` and calculates the total number of bikes allocated to `k` schoolboys based on their personal money and the prices of the bikes. It returns a tuple containing the total number of bikes allocated and the remaining number of bikes left after the allocation. The function does not account for cases where `k` exceeds the number of available bikes or the total number of schoolboys, which may lead to an incorrect allocation count. Additionally, the function assumes that the lists for personal money and bike prices are of sufficient length to accommodate `k`.
