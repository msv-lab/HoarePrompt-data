The function accepts a positive integer `k` and calculates the total number of bikes allocated to `k` schoolboys based on their personal money and the prices of the bikes. It returns a tuple containing the total number of bikes allocated and the remaining number of bikes left after the allocation. The function does not account for cases where `k` exceeds the number of available bikes or the total number of schoolboys, which may lead to an incorrect allocation count. Additionally, the function assumes that the lists for personal money and bike prices are of sufficient length to accommodate `k`.
