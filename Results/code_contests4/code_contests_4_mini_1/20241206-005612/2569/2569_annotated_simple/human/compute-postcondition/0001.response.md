The variable `b` is assigned the value `0`. Since `b` is initially a list of `n` positive integers, its previous values are replaced with `0`, meaning `b` will no longer hold the list of integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is now `0`, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is now `0`, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a**
