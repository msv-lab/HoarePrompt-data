The code `b -= left` decreases the value of `b` by the value of `left`. Since `b` represents the total number of bikes allocated and `left` represents the remaining number of bikes, after executing this line, `b` will be updated to reflect the number of bikes that have been used or allocated, while the values of `left`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is updated to `b - left`, `left` is the remaining number of bikes, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`b` is updated to `b - left`, `left` is the remaining number of bikes, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer.**
