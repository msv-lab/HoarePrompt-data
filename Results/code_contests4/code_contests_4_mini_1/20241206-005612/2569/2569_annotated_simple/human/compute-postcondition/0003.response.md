The variable `pi` is assigned the value `-k + i`. The value of `i` is `0`, and `k` is a positive integer since it must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, `pi` will be equal to `-k + 0`, which simplifies to `-k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is now `0`, `p` is a list of `m` positive integers, `left` is equal to `a, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `pi` is -k.**
