n is a positive integer representing the number of schoolboys, m is a positive integer representing the number of available bikes, a is a non-negative integer representing the shared budget, b is a list of integers where each bi (1 ≤ bi ≤ 104) represents the personal money of the i-th boy, and p is a list of integers where each pj (1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9) represents the price for renting the j-th bike. The lengths of b and p are n and m respectively.
