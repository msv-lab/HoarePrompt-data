The value of `b` is decremented by the value of `left`. The previous values of `b` and `left` are not specified, but `left` is adjusted based on the total costs incurred from bike rentals. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b` without specifying the exact values. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is adjusted based on the total costs incurred from bike rentals, `b` is decreased by `left`, `k` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop.**
