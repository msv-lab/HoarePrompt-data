The value of `pi` is calculated as `-k + i`. With `k` being greater than 1 and `i` being 1, `pi` will take the value of `-k + 1`. Given that `k > 1`, `-k + 1` will always be negative. The values of the other variables do not change as a result of this calculation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is adjusted based on the calculation `left -= max(0, bikes[0] - person[-k])`, `b` is increased by the minimum of `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]`, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `pi` is `-k + 1` (negative value).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is adjusted based on the calculation `left -= max(0, bikes[0] - person[-k])`, `b` is increased by the minimum of `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]`, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pi` is `-k + 1` (negative value)**.
