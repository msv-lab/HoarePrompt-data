Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `k`, and calculates the total number of bikes rented by schoolboys and the remaining budget after considering the costs of renting bikes. It returns a tuple containing the total number of bikes rented (adjusted by the remaining budget) and the remaining budget itself. The function does not handle situations where `k` exceeds the number of available bikes or schoolboys, nor does it account for cases where the rental cost exceeds the available budget. **
