The value of `pi` is assigned the value of `-k + i`. Given that `k` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, we can calculate `pi` as follows: 

`pi = -k + 2`.

Since `k` is greater than 1, `-k` will be a negative value, and adding 2 will yield a result that is less than 2. Therefore, the exact value of `pi` will depend on the specific value of `k`, but it will be less than 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is increased by min(person[pi], bikes[1]), `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is adjusted based on the calculation, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `pi` is less than 2.

Output State: **`b` is increased by min(person[pi], bikes[1]), `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is adjusted based on the calculation, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `pi` is less than 2.**
