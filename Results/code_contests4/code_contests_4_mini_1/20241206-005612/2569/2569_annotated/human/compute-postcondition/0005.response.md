Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is adjusted based on the calculation `left -= max(0, bikes[0] - person[-k])`, `b` is increased by the minimum of `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]`, where `pi` is equal to `-k`, `k` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.**
