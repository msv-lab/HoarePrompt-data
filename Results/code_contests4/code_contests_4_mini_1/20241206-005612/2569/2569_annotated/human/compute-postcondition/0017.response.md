The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `k`. The parameter `k` is not explicitly described in terms of its type or constraints in the provided information. However, it can be inferred that it is related to the other parameters mentioned (n, m, a, b, p) which are not directly passed to the function but are relevant to the context in which the function operates.

After executing the function body, it returns two values: the modified list `b` after being decreased by `left`, and the value of `left` which is adjusted based on the total costs incurred from bike rentals.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a parameter `k` and return the modified list `b` and the adjusted value of `left` based on the incurred costs from bike rentals. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter k and returns the modified list b after being decreased by left, and the adjusted value of left based on total costs from bike rentals.**
