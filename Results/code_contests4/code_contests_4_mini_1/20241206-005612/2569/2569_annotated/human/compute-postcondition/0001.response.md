The variable `b` is assigned the value 0. This means that the previous value of `b`, which was a list of integers representing the personal money of each boy, is overwritten and lost. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `p`, and `left`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of schoolboys, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of available bikes, `a` is a non-negative integer representing the shared budget, `p` is a list of integers representing the price for renting the bikes, and `left` is `a`, but `b` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of schoolboys, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of available bikes, `a` is a non-negative integer representing the shared budget, `p` is a list of integers representing the price for renting the bikes, `left` is `a`, and `b` is 0.**
