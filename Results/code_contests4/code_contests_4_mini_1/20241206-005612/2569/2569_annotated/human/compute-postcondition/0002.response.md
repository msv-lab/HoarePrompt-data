According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0. For the loop to execute, `k` must be a non-negative integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is non-negative, and `p` is a list of integers, we do not need to adjust those values for the loop execution. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop will iterate until `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is `a`, `b` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.**
