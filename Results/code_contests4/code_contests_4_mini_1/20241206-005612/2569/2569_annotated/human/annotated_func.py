#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of schoolboys, m is a positive integer representing the number of available bikes, a is a non-negative integer representing the shared budget, b is a list of integers where each bi (1 ≤ bi ≤ 104) represents the personal money of the i-th boy, and p is a list of integers where each pj (1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9) represents the price for renting the j-th bike. The lengths of b and p are n and m respectively.
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `left` is adjusted based on the total costs incurred from bike rentals, `b` is the total number of bikes rented, `k` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop.
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns the value of 'b' after being decreased by 'left', and the value of 'left' which is adjusted based on the total costs incurred from bike rentals.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `k`, and calculates the total number of bikes rented by schoolboys and the remaining budget after considering the costs of renting bikes. It returns a tuple containing the total number of bikes rented (adjusted by the remaining budget) and the remaining budget itself. The function does not handle situations where `k` exceeds the number of available bikes or schoolboys, nor does it account for cases where the rental cost exceeds the available budget.
