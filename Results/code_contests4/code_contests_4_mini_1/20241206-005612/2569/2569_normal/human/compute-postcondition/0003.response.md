The variable `pi` is assigned the value of `-k + i`. The value of `i` is 0, but the value of `k` is not specified beyond being greater than 0. Therefore, `pi` will take the value of `-k` (where `k` is a positive integer). The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`left` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `left` ≤ 10^9, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, and `pi` is `-k` where `k` is greater than 0.**
