Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `k` and calculates the total number of bikes assigned from a list of `bikes` based on the personal money of individuals in a list `person`. It also returns the remaining capacity after assigning the bikes. The function effectively assigns bikes by deducting the maximum money available from the bike prices, ensuring that any leftover capacity is accurately calculated. It returns a tuple containing the total number of assigned bikes and the remaining capacity. The annotations suggest that the function returns the values of `b` after decreasing them by `left`, but the code actually returns the adjusted count of bikes assigned and the remaining capacity instead. **
