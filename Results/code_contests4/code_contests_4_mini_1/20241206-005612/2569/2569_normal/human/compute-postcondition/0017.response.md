The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `k`. The parameter `k` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the values of the list `b` after it has been decreased by a value called `left`, as well as the remaining capacity `left`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `k` and return the modified list `b` and the remaining capacity `left`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter k and returns the values of list b after decreasing them by left, along with the remaining capacity left.**
