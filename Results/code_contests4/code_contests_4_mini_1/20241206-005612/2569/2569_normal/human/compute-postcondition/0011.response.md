Output State: **`left` is updated based on the calculation involving `bikes[1]` and `person[-k + 1]`, `b` is increased by the minimum of `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than `i + 1, and `i` is `current_value + 1`; `pi` is calculated as -k + i.**
