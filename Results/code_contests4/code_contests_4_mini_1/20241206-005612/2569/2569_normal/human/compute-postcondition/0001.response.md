`b` is assigned the value `0`, and the previous value of `left` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `left` ≤ 10^9; `b` is 0.
Output State: **`left` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `left` ≤ 10^9; `b` is 0**
