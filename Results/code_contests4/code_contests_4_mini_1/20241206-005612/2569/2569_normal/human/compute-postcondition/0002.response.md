According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `left` being a non-negative integer does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to set `k` to be greater than 0 and initialize `i` to 0. 

State: **`left` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `left` ≤ 10^9, `b` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
