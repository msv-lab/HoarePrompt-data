To determine the output state after the loop completes its execution, we analyze the provided loop code and initial state. The loop iterates `k` times, updating the values of `left` and `b` based on the `bikes` and `person` arrays.

1. **Variable `left`**: It starts as a non-negative integer and is decremented by `max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])` for each iteration. This means that `left` will decrease by the difference between the number of bikes and the corresponding person's capacity, but never below zero. Therefore, after `k` iterations, `left` will be adjusted based on the total difference calculated across all iterations.

2. **Variable `b`**: It starts at 0 and is incremented by `min(person[pi], bikes[i])` for each iteration. This means `b` will accumulate the total number of bikes assigned to the persons, constrained by the number of bikes available and the capacity of each person.

3. **Variables `i` and `pi`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will equal `k`, and `pi` will equal `-k + k - 1`, which simplifies to `-1`.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop:
- `left` will represent the remaining capacity after attempting to assign bikes to persons.
- `b` will represent the total number of bikes successfully assigned to persons.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`left` is the remaining capacity after bike assignments, `b` is the total number of bikes assigned, `k` is the total number of iterations (which is the length of the bikes/person arrays), `i` is equal to `k`, `pi` is `-1`.**
