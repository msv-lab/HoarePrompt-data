The value of `pi` is assigned the result of `-k + i`. The current value of `i` is 1, and since `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is at least 2. Thus, the minimum value of `pi` can be calculated as follows: if `k` is 2, then `pi = -2 + 1 = -1`. 

Therefore, the possible values of `pi` can be -1 or less, depending on the value of `k`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`left` is updated to `left - max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])`, `b` is updated to `min(person[-k], bikes[0])`, `i` is 1, `pi` is -k + 1 (where `k` is greater than 1)**
