Output State: **`left` is updated based on the calculation involving `bikes[1]` and `person[-k + 1]`; `b` is increased by the minimum of `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]`; `k` is greater than `i + 1; `i` is `current_value + 1`; `pi` is calculated as -k + i; `left` is decreased by max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])**
