#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000; a is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; b is a list of n integers where each bi (1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4) represents the personal money of the i-th boy; p is a list of m integers where each pj (1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9) represents the renting price of the j-th bike.
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` is the remaining capacity after bike assignments, `b` is the total number of bikes assigned, `k` is the total number of iterations (which is the length of the bikes/person arrays), `i` is equal to `k`, `pi` is `-1`.
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns the values of b after it has been decreased by left, and the remaining capacity left
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `k` and calculates the total number of bikes assigned from a list of `bikes` based on the personal money of individuals in a list `person`. It also returns the remaining capacity after assigning the bikes. The function effectively assigns bikes by deducting the maximum money available from the bike prices, ensuring that any leftover capacity is accurately calculated. It returns a tuple containing the total number of assigned bikes and the remaining capacity. The annotations suggest that the function returns the values of `b` after decreasing them by `left`, but the code actually returns the adjusted count of bikes assigned and the remaining capacity instead.
