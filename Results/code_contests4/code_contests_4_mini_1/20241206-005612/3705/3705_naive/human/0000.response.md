To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and the requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to compute the sum of numbers written on a blackboard in a specific pattern defined as follows:
1. The first stage writes 1 odd number (1).
2. The second stage writes the first 2 even numbers (2, 4).
3. The third stage writes the next 4 odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 9).
4. The fourth stage writes the next 8 even numbers (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18).
5. This pattern continues, doubling the count of numbers written in each stage and alternating between odd and even.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes a function `func_1(n)` which appears to calculate some cumulative values based on the stages described. The function iterates over a maximum of 100 stages, alternating between sums of odd and even numbers. It keeps track of the sum of odd numbers (`f`) and even numbers (`s`). The output is derived from these sums.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Range Limitation**: The loop in `func_1` is restricted to 100 iterations. Given that `l` and `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), this could lead to a situation where the function does not account for all possible numbers due to the limited number of stages considered.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The way the sums of odd and even numbers are accumulated might not accurately reflect the required numbers in the range `[l, r]` due to the `min(p, n)` logic used in the loop. If `n` is very large, it may terminate early without fully capturing all relevant numbers.
3. **Modulo Application**: The final result applies modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but whether the intermediate steps adhere to this is unclear.

### Example of Failure:
Suppose we take a large input case, such as \(l = 1\) and \(r = 1000000000000000000\). The function may not sum all the appropriate odd and even numbers because it stops iterating after 100 stages. This would result in missing many odd and even numbers that should be included in the sum, thereby generating an incorrect total.

### Conclusion:
Due to the above issues, especially the potential for incomplete summation when `l` and `r` are very large, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
