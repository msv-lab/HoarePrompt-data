The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. If a certain condition is met (Case_1), the function returns 0. If another condition is met (Case_2), the function returns the result of `f` squared plus `s` multiplied by `(s + 1)`, where `f` is the sum of contributions for even indices and `s` is the sum of contributions for odd indices. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 0 or a computed value based on the contributions from even and odd indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns 0 for a specific condition, or a computed value based on even and odd contributions for another condition.**
