The value of `f` is incremented by the minimum of `p` and `n`. The previous values of `p` is `2 * p`, and `n` is not specified but is a variable that holds a positive integer value. The output state will reflect the changes made to `f` based on the values of `p` and `n`. Since `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unaffected, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is doubled to `2 * p`, `i` is 100, and `f` is increased by `min(2 * p, n)`.

Output State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is doubled to `2 * p`, `i` is 100, and `f` is increased by `min(2 * p, n)`**.
