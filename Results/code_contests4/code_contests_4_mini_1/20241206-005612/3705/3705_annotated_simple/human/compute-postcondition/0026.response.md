The value of `s` is incremented by the minimum of `p` and `n`. Since `n` is less than or equal to 0, the minimum value will be `n`. The variable `p` has been multiplied by 2, but its specific value is not provided, so we can't determine the exact value of `min(p, n)`. However, we can conclude that `s` is updated by adding `n` (which is non-positive). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `p` is now multiplied by 2; `i` is 1; `s` is incremented by `n`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `p` is now multiplied by 2; `i` is 1; `s` is incremented by `n.**
