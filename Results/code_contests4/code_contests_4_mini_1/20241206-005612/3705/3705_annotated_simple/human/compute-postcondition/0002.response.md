`p` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `f`, `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `f` is 0, `s` is 0, and `p` is 1.  
Output State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `f` is 0, `s` is 0, `p` is 1**
