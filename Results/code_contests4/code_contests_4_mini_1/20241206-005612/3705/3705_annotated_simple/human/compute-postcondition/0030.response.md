The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers; `n` is less than or equal to -p; `p` is multiplied by 2; `s` is incremented by `n`; `i` is 1 if `i` is odd; otherwise, `p` is multiplied by 2; `f` is increased by `n`; and `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
