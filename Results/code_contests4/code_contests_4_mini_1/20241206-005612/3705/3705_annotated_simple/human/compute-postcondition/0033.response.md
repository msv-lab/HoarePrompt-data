To analyze the loop's output state after all iterations have executed, we can observe the following:

1. The loop iterates up to 100 times, but it can exit early if `n` becomes less than or equal to 0.
2. In each iteration, the variable `p` is doubled, starting from 1. This means after `k` iterations, `p` will be `2^k`.
3. Depending on whether the iteration index `i` is even or odd, either `f` or `s` is incremented by `min(p, n)`.
4. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `p`. As `p` increases exponentially, it will eventually cause `n` to become less than or equal to 0, leading to a break from the loop.
5. Once `n` is reduced to 0 or below, the loop will terminate, and no further iterations will occur.

Considering these points and the fact that `n` starts as a positive integer and is decremented by an exponentially increasing `p`, the loop will execute a limited number of times before breaking out.

After all iterations:
- `l` and `r` remain positive integers as they are not modified by the loop.
- `p` will be `2^k` where `k` is the number of times the loop successfully executes before `n` becomes 0 or less.
- `f` will contain the sum of contributions made during the iterations where `i` is even.
- `s` will contain the sum of contributions made during the iterations where `i` is odd.
- `n` will be less than or equal to 0 after the last iteration that decremented it.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers; `p` is 2 raised to the number of iterations executed; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `f` is the sum of contributions for even `i`; `s` is the sum of contributions for odd `i`.**
