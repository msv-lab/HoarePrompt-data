The value of `p` is multiplied by 2, but the previous value of `p` is unknown, so it will now hold a value that is double its previous value. The states of `l`, `r`, and `n` are not affected, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement as indicated. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are positive integers; `n` is less than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `p` is now multiplied by 2.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers; `n` is less than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `p` is now multiplied by 2.**
