The expression `f += min(p, n)` means that `f` will be increased by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. Given that `n` is less than or equal to 0, the minimum value between `p` (which is a positive integer since it was multiplied by 2) and `n` will be `n`. Therefore, `f` will be decreased by the value of `n` (since adding a non-positive number decreases the total or leaves it unchanged). The states of the other variables, `l`, `r`, and `i`, remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are positive integers; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `p` is now multiplied by 2; `i` is 1; `f` is increased by `n`.**
