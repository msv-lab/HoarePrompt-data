The value of `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `i` are not directly affected, but `p` is previously doubled to `2 * p`. The exact values of `n` and `s` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is `2 * p`, `i` is 100, and `s` is increased by `min(2 * p, n)`.

Output State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is `2 * p`, `i` is 100, `s` is increased by min(2 * p, n)**
