According to the code, the loop is set to execute a total of 100 times, as defined by the range function. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have reached 99 since the loop starts at 0 and ends at 99. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 100. 

Since the loop is controlled by the range function and not dependent on any conditions related to `l`, `r`, or `p`, there are no additional requirements concerning these variables for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`l` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `p` is doubled to `2 * p`, for the loop to execute a hundredth time `i` must be 100.**
