Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are positive integers. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, then `p` is multiplied by 2, `s` is incremented by `n`, and `i` is set to 1 if it was odd; otherwise, `p` is multiplied by 2 again, `f` is increased by `n`, and `i` is set to 1, while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
