To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, we need to thoroughly analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Summary
The problem describes a sequence of numbers being written from two sets: odd positive numbers and even positive numbers. The pattern is such that:

1. In the first stage, the first number from the odd set is written.
2. In the second stage, the first two numbers from the even set are written.
3. In the third stage, the next four numbers from the odd set are written.
4. In the fourth stage, the next eight numbers from the even set are written.

This alternation continues, doubling the count of numbers written at each stage. The task is to compute the sum of the numbers that fall into the range from `l` to `r`.

### Analysis of the Program
The program defines a function `func_1(n)` which is supposed to compute the sum of numbers in the aforementioned pattern. Here are the key points in the program:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes `f` for the sum of even indexed stages (even numbers) and `s` for the sum of odd indexed stages (odd numbers), along with `p` which tracks the number of numbers to be written at each stage.

2. **Looping through stages**: A loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (100), where for each iteration:
   - If the index is odd, it adds to `s` (for odd numbers).
   - If the index is even, it adds to `f` (for even numbers).
   - It reduces `n` by `p` (the number of numbers processed in that stage).
   - If `n` drops to zero or below, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Final Calculation**: It returns the calculated sum using the formula `f * f + s * (s + 1)`.

### Issues in the Implementation
1. **Incorrect Range Handling**: The implementation does not correctly compute the sum of numbers specifically between indices `l` and `r`. Instead, it processes numbers up to a maximum of 100 iterations without regard for the specified range.

2. **Fixed Iteration Count**: The use of a fixed iteration count (100) is problematic since `l` and `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\). This means the loop will not cover all necessary stages and could lead to incomplete sums.

3. **Sum Calculation Logic**: The formula used to compute the final sum (`f * f + s * (s + 1)`) does not directly correspond to the way numbers are structured in the problem description and does not guarantee that sums are calculated correctly for any range.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly adhere to the problem description and therefore is not guaranteed to produce correct results for the input range specified. Given the inconsistencies found in both the logic and handling of input ranges, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**
