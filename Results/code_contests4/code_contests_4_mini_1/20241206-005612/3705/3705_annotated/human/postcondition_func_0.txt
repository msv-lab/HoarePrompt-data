The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is 0. If `n` is greater than 0, it calculates the sums of contributions from even and odd indexed iterations of a loop, where the contributions are determined by the powers of 2, and returns the result of the expression `f * f + s * (s + 1)`, where `f` is the sum from even indexed iterations and `s` is the sum from odd indexed iterations. The loop runs at most 100 times or until `n` becomes non-positive.
