The variable `f` is assigned the value of 0. The initial values of `l` and `r` are not affected by this assignment, and their constraints remain the same (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18). Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0**
