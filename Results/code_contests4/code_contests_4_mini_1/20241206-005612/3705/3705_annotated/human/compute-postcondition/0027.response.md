The variable `f` is incremented by the minimum of `p` and `n`. Given that `p` is 4 and `n` is less than or equal to 0, the minimum will be `n`, which is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, `f` will not be incremented (it will effectively remain unchanged). The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `p` is 4; `i` is 100; `f` remains unchanged.**
