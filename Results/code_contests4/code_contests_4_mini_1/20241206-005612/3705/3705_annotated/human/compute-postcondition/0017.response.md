According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will execute up to 100 iterations, so it will run as long as `i` is less than 100. At the end of the last iteration, there are no specific details about the value of `i`, but since the loop is structured to run 100 times, we can infer that `i` is currently less than 100. 

Assuming `i` has reached its maximum value of 99 at the end of the last iteration (which is the highest value it can take before the loop exits), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will now be 100, which means the loop cannot execute again since it will not satisfy the condition of `i` being less than 100.

If `i` was less than 99, it would be incremented from that value for the next iteration. Therefore, we can conclude that if the loop is to execute one more time, then `i` must be incremented, and we can state that `i` must be 99 at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; `f` has been increased by min(1, n) if `i` is even; `p` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 99.**
