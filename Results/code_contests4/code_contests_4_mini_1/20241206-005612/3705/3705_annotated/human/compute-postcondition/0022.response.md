The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; `n` is decreased by 2; `p` remains 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
