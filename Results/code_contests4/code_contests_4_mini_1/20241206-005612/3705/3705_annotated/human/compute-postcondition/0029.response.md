The value of `n` is decremented by `p`, where `p` is 4. Since `n` is less than or equal to 0, the new value of `n` will be less than or equal to -4 after the operation. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is updated by adding `n` if `i` is odd. If `i` is even, `s` remains unchanged; `n` is less than or equal to -4; `p` is 4; `i` is 100.**
