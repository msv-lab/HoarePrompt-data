Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; if `i` is odd, `s` is increased by either 2 or `n`, depending on the value of `n`; otherwise, `f` is increased by min(2, n). In both cases, `p` remains 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 99.***
