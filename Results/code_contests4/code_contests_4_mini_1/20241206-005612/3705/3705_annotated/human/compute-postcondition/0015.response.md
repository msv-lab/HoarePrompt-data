Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; `f` has been increased by min(1, n) if `i` is even; `p` remains 1; if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
