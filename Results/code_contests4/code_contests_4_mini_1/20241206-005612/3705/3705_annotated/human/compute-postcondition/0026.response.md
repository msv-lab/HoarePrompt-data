The value of `s` is incremented by `min(p, n)`. Given that `p` is 4 and `n` is less than or equal to 0, the result of `min(p, n)` will be `n`, which is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, `s` will be increased by a non-positive value, meaning `s` will remain the same or decrease. 

Hence, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `p` is 4; `i` is 100; and `s` is updated by adding `n`, which does not change its original value if `n` is 0 or decreases if `n` is negative.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `p` is 4; `i` is 100; `s` is updated by adding `n`.**
