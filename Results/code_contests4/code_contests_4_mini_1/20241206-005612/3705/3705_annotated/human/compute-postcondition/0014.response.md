The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; `f` has been increased by min(1, n) if `i` is even; `p` remains 1; `n` has been decreased by 1; and `n` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
