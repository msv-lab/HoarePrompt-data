The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if a certain condition is met (which is not specified in the output), the function returns 0. In another case, the function returns a value calculated from the expression `f * f + s * (s + 1)`, where 'f' is the sum of contributions from even indexed iterations and 's' is the sum of contributions from odd indexed iterations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return either 0 or a calculated value based on the contributions from even and odd indexed iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns 0 under certain conditions, or a calculated value based on contributions from even and odd indexed iterations.**
