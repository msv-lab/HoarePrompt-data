The value of `p` is multiplied by 2, but the previous value of `p` is unknown. The other variables `l`, `r`, `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the conditions stated. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; if `n` is less than or equal to 0, then `s` remains unchanged; `i` is even (100); `p` is multiplied by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
