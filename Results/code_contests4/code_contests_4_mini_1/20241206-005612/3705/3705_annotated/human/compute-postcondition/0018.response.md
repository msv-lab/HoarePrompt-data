The value of `s` is incremented by `min(p, n)`. The value of `p` is 2, but the value of `n` is not provided, so we can only define `min(p, n)` based on the unknown value of `n`. 

If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, then `min(p, n)` is 2. If `n` is less than 2, then `min(p, n)` is `n`. Therefore, the output state will vary depending on the value of `n`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; `f` has been increased by min(1, n) if `i` is even; `p` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 99; `s` is increased by either 2 or `n`, depending on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `s` is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `i`; `f` has been increased by min(1, n) if `i` is even; `p` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 99; `s` is increased by either 2 or `n`, depending on the value of `n`.**
