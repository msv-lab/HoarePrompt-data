To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it adheres to the problem description and correctly computes the required sums for the ranges \( l \) to \( r \).

The problem describes a sequence of numbers that alternate between odd and even numbers, with the count of numbers doubling at each stage. The sequence starts with 1 (the first odd number), then takes 2 even numbers (2, 4), then the next 4 odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 9), then the next 8 even numbers (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), and so forth.

1. The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that seems to attempt to calculate the sum of the numbers in the sequence up to the \( n \)-th number.
2. The main logic involves a loop that alternates between summing odd and even numbers based on the index \( i \) (odd/even) and a variable \( p \) that doubles the amount of numbers considered at each step.
3. It handles up to 100 iterations, which may not be sufficient for large values of \( n \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) as stated in the problem constraints.
4. The summation performed within the function does not seem to correctly implement the logic for the sequence as described, especially in terms of accumulating the correct set of numbers in the required order and counts.

### Potential Cases That Could Fail:
- For large values of \( l \) and \( r \), such as \( (1, 10^{18}) \), the logic inside the loop might not sum the correct series of numbers due to the limited number of iterations (100) and the way numbers are being added.
- Numbers from \( 10^{18} \) are not directly handled; the function relies on a loop that may not iterate enough times to cover the entire range of odd/even numbers.

### Conclusion:
Given that there can be cases where the function does not correctly compute the sums, particularly with large \( n \), and due to the inherent limitations of the iteration count, it can be inferred that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
