You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nazar, a student of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, is known for his outstanding mathematical abilities. Today a math teacher gave him a very difficult task.

Consider two infinite sets of numbers. The first set consists of odd positive numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, …), and the second set consists of even positive numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, …). At the first stage, the teacher writes the first number on the endless blackboard from the first set, in the second stage — the first two numbers from the second set, on the third stage — the next four numbers from the first set, on the fourth — the next eight numbers from the second set and so on. In other words, at each stage, starting from the second, he writes out two times more numbers than at the previous one, and also changes the set from which these numbers are written out to another. 

The ten first written numbers: 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10. Let's number the numbers written, starting with one.

The task is to find the sum of numbers with numbers from l to r for given integers l and r. The answer may be big, so you need to find the remainder of the division by 1000000007 (10^9+7).

Nazar thought about this problem for a long time, but didn't come up with a solution. Help him solve this problem.

Input

The first line contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^{18}) — the range in which you need to find the sum.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).

Output


761141116

Note

In the first example, the answer is the sum of the first three numbers written out (1 + 2 + 4 = 7).

In the second example, the numbers with numbers from 5 to 14: 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. Their sum is 105.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    f = 0
    s = 0
    p = 1
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    for i in range(100):
        if i % 2:
            s += min(p, n)
        else:
            f += min(p, n)
        n -= p
        if n <= 0:
            break
        p *= 2
    return f * f + s * (s + 1)
(l, r) = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
print(func_1(r) - func_1(l - 1)) % 1000000007
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
