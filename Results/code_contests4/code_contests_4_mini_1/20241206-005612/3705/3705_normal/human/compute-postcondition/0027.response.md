The value of `f` is incremented by the minimum of `p` and `n`. Since `n` is less than or equal to 0, the minimum of `p` (which is not defined in the initial state) and `n` will be `n` itself, which is non-positive. Therefore, `f` is increased by a non-positive value, leaving it unchanged. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 100; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`; `f` remains unchanged; `n` is decreased by `p`; `p` is multiplied by 2; `f` remains unchanged.**
