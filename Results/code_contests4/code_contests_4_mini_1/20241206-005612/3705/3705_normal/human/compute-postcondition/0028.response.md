Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 100, and `n` is less than or equal to 0. If `i` is odd, `s` is decreased by `n`, `f` remains unchanged, `n` is decreased by `p`, and `p` is multiplied by 2. Otherwise, `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`, `f` remains unchanged, `n` is decreased by `p`, and `p` is multiplied by 2.***
