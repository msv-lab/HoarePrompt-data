The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is odd (99); `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`; `f` is unchanged; `n` is decreased by `p` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
