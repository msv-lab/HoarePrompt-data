The value of `p` is multiplied by 2. However, the previous value of `p` is not provided, so we cannot determine its new value. The states of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `f`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is odd (99); `n` is less than or equal to 0; `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`, `f` remains unchanged, `n` is decreased by `p`, and the value of `p` is multiplied by 2.
