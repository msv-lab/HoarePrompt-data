According to the code, the loop will execute exactly 100 times regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `f`, `s`, `p`, and `n`. The only relevant variable for the loop execution is `i`, which will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop and will increment up to 99 throughout the iterations. 

Since the loop will execute 100 times, `i` will start at 0. The values of `l`, `r`, `f`, `s`, `p`, and `n` do not affect the execution of the loop itself as they do not control the loop's range or condition. 

However, we can state the initial value of `i` for clarity. 

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0; `s` is 0; `p` is 1; `n` is not equal to 0; `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
