The value of `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`. Since `n` is less than or equal to 0, the minimum value will be `n` (which is ≤ 0). Therefore, `s` will effectively decrease by `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is 100; `n` is less than or equal to 0; `s` is decreased by `n`; `f` remains unchanged; `n` is decreased by `p`; `p` is multiplied by 2.**
