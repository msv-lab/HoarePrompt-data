Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is odd (99); if `n` is less than or equal to 0, then `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`, `f` remains unchanged, `n` is decreased by `p`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
