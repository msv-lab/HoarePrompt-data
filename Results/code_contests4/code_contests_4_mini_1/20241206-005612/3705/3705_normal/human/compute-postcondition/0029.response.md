The code snippet `n -= p` means that the value of `n` will be decreased by the value of `p`. However, the initial state specifies that `n` is less than or equal to 0, and since `p` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact new value of `n`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 100, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `n` is decreased by `p`.**
