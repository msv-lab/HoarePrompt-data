Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; if `n` is less than or equal to 0, then `i` is an odd integer, resulting in `s` being set to 1, `f` remaining 0, and `p` being 1 with `n` not equal to 0; or if `i` is an even integer, then `f` is assigned the value of `0 + min(1, n)`, `s` is set to 0, and `p` remains 1 with `n` not equal to 0, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
