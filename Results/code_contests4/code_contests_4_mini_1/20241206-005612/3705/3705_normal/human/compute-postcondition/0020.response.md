Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18. If `i` is odd (i.e., `i` is 99), `s` is increased by the minimum of `p` and `n`, but since the loop condition is not satisfied, the loop does not execute again. If `i` is even, `f` is incremented by the minimum of `p` and `n`.***
