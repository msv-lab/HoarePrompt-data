The variable `f` is initialized to 0. The initial values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged and are still integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18. The execution of the code does not affect `l` or `r`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18; `f` is 0**
