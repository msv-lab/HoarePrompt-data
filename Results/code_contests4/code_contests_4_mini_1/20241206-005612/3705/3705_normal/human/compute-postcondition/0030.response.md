The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 100, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `n` is decreased by `p` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
