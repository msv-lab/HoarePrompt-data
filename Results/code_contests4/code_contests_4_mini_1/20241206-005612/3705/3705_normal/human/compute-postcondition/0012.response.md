Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; if `i` is an odd integer, then `s` is set to 1, while `f` remains 0, and `p` is 1 with `n` not equal to 0; if `i` is an even integer, then `f` is assigned the value of `0 + min(1, n)`, `s` is set to 0, and `p` remains 1 with `n` not equal to 0; `n` is decremented by 1 (since `p` is 1).**
