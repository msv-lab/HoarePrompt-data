The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if a certain condition is met (not specified), the function returns 0. If that condition is not met, the function returns the value of f squared plus s times (s plus 1), where f is the sum of the minimum values of powers of 2 and n at each even iteration, and s is the sum of the minimum values of powers of 2 and n at each odd iteration. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return either 0 or a calculated value based on the sums of minimum values of powers of 2 and `n` across even and odd iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns 0 under certain conditions, or returns the value of f squared plus s times (s plus 1), where f and s are sums based on the minimum values of powers of 2 and n at even and odd iterations respectively.**
