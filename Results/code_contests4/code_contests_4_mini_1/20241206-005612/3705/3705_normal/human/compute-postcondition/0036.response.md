Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is 0. If `n` is positive, it computes two sums, `f` and `s`, based on the minimum values of powers of 2 (incremented in a loop) and the remaining value of `n` at each iteration. The function then returns the value of `f` squared plus `s` times `(s + 1)`. The loop runs a maximum of 100 times or until `n` becomes less than or equal to 0, effectively handling cases where `n` is large, up to \(10^{18}\). **
