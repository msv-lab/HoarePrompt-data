Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `f` is equal to the sum of the minimum values of powers of 2 and `n` at each even iteration, `s` is equal to the sum of the minimum values of powers of 2 and `n` at each odd iteration, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `p` is the smallest power of 2 that exceeds `n` when it becomes less than or equal to 0.**
