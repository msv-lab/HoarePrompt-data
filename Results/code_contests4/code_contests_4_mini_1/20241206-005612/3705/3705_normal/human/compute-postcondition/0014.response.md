The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18; `i` is an odd integer, then `s` is set to 1, `f` remains 0, and `p` is 1 with `n` not equal to 0; or `i` is an even integer, then `f` is assigned the value of `0 + min(1, n)`, `s` is set to 0, and `p` remains 1 with `n` not equal to 0; `n` is less than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
