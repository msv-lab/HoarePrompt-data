Correctness: **False**

The annotated program only includes a single function `func_1(i, j)` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two pieces of meat based on their coordinates. However, it does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description, which states that Takahashi needs to find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready to eat by minimizing the time taken based on the hardness of the meat and the distance from a heat source.

The following points illustrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The program does not contain any logic to determine the optimal placement of the heat source (X, Y) to minimize the time required for K pieces of meat to be ready. The problem description requires a comprehensive solution, including the placement of the heat source based on the hardness and coordinates of the meat.

2. **Lack of Time Calculation**: The program does not compute the time it takes for the pieces of meat to be ready based on their hardness and the distance to the heat source, which is a crucial part of the problem.

3. **Absence of Input Handling**: The program does not read or process the input as specified in the problem description, which includes multiple pieces of meat with their respective coordinates and hardness values.

4. **No Output Generation**: Finally, there is no mechanism in the program to output the result as required by the problem description, which specifies that the time must be printed.

In summary, while the function `func_1(i, j)` correctly calculates the distance between two points, it does not contribute to the overall solution needed to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem description as a whole.
