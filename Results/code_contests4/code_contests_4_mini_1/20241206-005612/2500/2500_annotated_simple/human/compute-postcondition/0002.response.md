Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, and returns the Euclidean distance between the points defined by their coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). The coordinates X and Y are assumed to be lists of integers within the range of -1000 to 1000, and the function assumes that the indices `i` and `j` are valid and correspond to distinct points. There are no checks for index validity or handling of cases where `i` and `j` might be out of bounds. **
