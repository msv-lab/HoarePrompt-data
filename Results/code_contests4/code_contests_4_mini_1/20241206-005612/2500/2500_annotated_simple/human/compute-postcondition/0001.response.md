The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`. Both `i` and `j` are integers representing indices of distinct pieces of meat with coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]), where the coordinates are within the range of -1000 to 1000. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the points (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer indices and return the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points defined by those indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters i and j, and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]).**
