You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.

Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.

Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 60
* 1 \leq K \leq N
* -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
* \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
* 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N


Output

Print the answer.

It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and for each piece of meat i (where 1 <= i <= N), (x_i, y_i) are integers with -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 100, and (x_i, y_i) are unique pairs for different pieces of meat.
def func_1(i, j):
    return math.sqrt((X[i] - X[j]) ** 2 + (Y[i] - Y[j]) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) of two pieces of meat, where (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) are unique pairs for indices i and j.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `i` and `j`, and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of two pieces of meat located at indices `i` and `j`. The function assumes that the coordinates are stored in two separate lists `X` and `Y`, and it does not handle cases where the indices `i` or `j` are out of the bounds of these lists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
