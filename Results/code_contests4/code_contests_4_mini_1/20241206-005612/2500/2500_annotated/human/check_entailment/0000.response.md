Correctness: **False**

The annotated program only includes a function `func_1` that calculates the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of two pieces of meat. However, it does not implement the full functionality required by the problem description, which involves:

1. Placing a heat source at optimal coordinates (X, Y) to minimize the time taken to grill K or more pieces of meat.
2. Calculating the time required for the grilling process based on the hardness of the meat and the distances from the heat source.

The provided function does not address the overall problem of determining the optimal placement of the heat source or calculating the time required for K pieces of meat to be ready, which are critical components of the task as specified in the problem description.

In summary, the function `func_1` is a small part of the overall solution and does not fulfill the requirements needed to solve the problem as a whole. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
