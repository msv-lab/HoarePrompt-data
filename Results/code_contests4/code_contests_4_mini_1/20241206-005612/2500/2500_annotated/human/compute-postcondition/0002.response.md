Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `i` and `j`, and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of two pieces of meat located at indices `i` and `j`. The function assumes that the coordinates are stored in two separate lists `X` and `Y`, and it does not handle cases where the indices `i` or `j` are out of the bounds of these lists. **
