The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `i` and `j`, both of which are integers. The value of `i` represents the index of the first piece of meat, and the value of `j` represents the index of the second piece of meat. The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) of the two pieces of meat corresponding to these indices. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer indices `i` and `j`, and return the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of the pieces of meat at these indices.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, i and j, and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of the pieces of meat at indices i and j.**
