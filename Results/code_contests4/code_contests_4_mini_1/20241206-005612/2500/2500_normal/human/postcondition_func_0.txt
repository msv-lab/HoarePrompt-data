The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, which are indices for pieces of meat, and returns the Euclidean distance between the pieces of meat located at coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). There are no checks for the validity of `i` and `j` against the lengths of the lists X and Y, which could potentially lead to an IndexError if `i` or `j` are out of bounds.
