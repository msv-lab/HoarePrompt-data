The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`. Both `i` and `j` are integers, which represent indices of pieces of meat in the lists of coordinates. The function returns the Euclidean distance between the two pieces of meat located at the coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer indices `i` and `j`, and return the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding pieces of meat based on their coordinates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `i` and `j`, which are indices of pieces of meat, and returns the Euclidean distance between the pieces of meat at coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]).**
