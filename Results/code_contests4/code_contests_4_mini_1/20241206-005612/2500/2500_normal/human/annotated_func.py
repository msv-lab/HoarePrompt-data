#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and each piece of meat is represented by coordinates (x_i, y_i) which are integers in the range [-1000, 1000] with distinct pairs for different pieces of meat, and c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_1(i, j):
    return math.sqrt((X[i] - X[j]) ** 2 + (Y[i] - Y[j]) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between two pieces of meat represented by coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, which are indices for pieces of meat, and returns the Euclidean distance between the pieces of meat located at coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). There are no checks for the validity of `i` and `j` against the lengths of the lists X and Y, which could potentially lead to an IndexError if `i` or `j` are out of bounds.
