The function accepts two lists of distinct integers, `h` and `p`, both sorted in ascending order. It calculates the minimum average time required such that all elements in `p` can be reached from the corresponding elements in `h` based on specific movement rules. The function performs a binary search to determine this average time and prints the result. If all elements in `p` can be reached within the calculated average time, it will return the minimum such average. It does not handle cases where the input constraints are violated, such as non-distinct integers or integers outside the specified range.
