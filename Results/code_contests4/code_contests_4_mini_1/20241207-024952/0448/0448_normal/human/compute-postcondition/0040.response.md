To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop statement. The loop condition is `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`. 

1. The first part of the condition, `pidx < len(p)`, means that `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. 
2. The second part of the condition, `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, requires that the current value of `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given that `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, we can infer the following:
- `furthestright` depends on the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.
- For the loop to execute, both conditions must hold true.

Now, we need to ensure:
- `pidx` must be less than the length of `p` (this means that the initial value of `pidx` must be valid).
- The value at `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since we don't have specific values for `pidx` or the contents of `p`, we can say:
- We need to ensure that `pidx` is initialized such that it is less than `len(p)`.
- We also need to make sure that `p[pidx]` is appropriately set to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute the first time, we can make the following adjustments:

State: **`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); pidx is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to furthestright`**
