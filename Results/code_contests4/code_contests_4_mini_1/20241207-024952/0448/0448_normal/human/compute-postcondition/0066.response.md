The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, and the values of `pidx` and `furthestright` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `furthestright` remains unchanged, and `hidx` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `furthestright` remains unchanged, and `hidx` is increased by 1.**
