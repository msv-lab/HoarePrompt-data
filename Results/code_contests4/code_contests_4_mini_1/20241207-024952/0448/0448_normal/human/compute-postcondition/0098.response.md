The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is 2, so after execution, `pidx` becomes 3. The values of `hidx` and the conditions for the loop remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 3, and the loop condition remains the same.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 3, and the loop condition remains the same.**
