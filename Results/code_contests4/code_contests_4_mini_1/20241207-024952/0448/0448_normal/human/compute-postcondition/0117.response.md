The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is not specified, so we cannot determine its new value. The initial state mentions that for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than the original value of `pidx` before being incremented. However, no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; `pidx` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; `pidx` is incremented by 1.**
