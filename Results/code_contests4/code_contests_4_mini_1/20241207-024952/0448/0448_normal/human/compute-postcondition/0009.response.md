To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` statement: `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)`. 

1. We know `hidx` is initialized to 0, and `h` is a list based on user input. Therefore, for `hidx < len(h)` to be true, `len(h)` must be greater than 0.
2. Similarly, `pidx` is initialized to 0, and `p` is also a list based on user input. Thus, for `pidx < len(p)` to be true, `len(p)` must also be greater than 0.

Given that both `h` and `p` are based on user input, we need to ensure that both lists are not empty for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure that both lists contain at least one element.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on user input, for the loop to execute the first time then `len(h) > 0` and `len(p) > 0`**
