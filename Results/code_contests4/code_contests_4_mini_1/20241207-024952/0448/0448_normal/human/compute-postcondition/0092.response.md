To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact on the variables based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `hidx` is 0
- `pidx` is 0
- `works` is False
- `ll` is equal to `avg`
- `ss` is less than `ll`
- `leftget` is equal to `p[0]`
- `curpos` is equal to `h[0]`
- `getbacktime` is calculated as `max(0, 2 * (h[0] - p[0]))`
- `alsotoright` is calculated as `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`
- `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`
- `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`

### Code Execution:
1. `furthestright` is assigned the value `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
2. The values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` will determine the value of `furthestright`.

Since we need to provide the output state without specific values for `avg`, `h[0]`, or `p[0]`, we describe the relationships:

- `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, where:
  - `curpos` is `h[0]`
  - `alsotoright` is dependent on `avg` and `getbacktime`
  - `remtime` is dependent on `avg` and `leftime`

### Output State:
The exact values of `furthestright`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` depend on the unknown values of `avg`, `h[0]`, and `p[0]`, but we can describe the relationships.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False; `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` where `curpos` is `h[0]`, `alsotoright` is `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, and `remtime` is `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`**
