The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, which means it now points to the next index in the list `p`. The previous value of `pidx` is not specified, but it is clear that `pidx` is increased by 1. The other variables (`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is increased by 1.**
