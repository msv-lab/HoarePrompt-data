To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one time, we analyze the conditions under which the loop can run. 

The loop statement is:
```
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
```

The loop will execute if:
1. `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, which means `pidx < len(p)` must be true.
2. The value `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Now let's consider the current state:
- `pidx` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`. This means that `pidx` is effectively counting how many valid elements there are, which suggests that `pidx` is likely less than `len(p)` if there are elements remaining.
- If `pidx` is currently equal to `len(p)`, then the first condition will not hold.
- The second condition (`p[pidx] <= furthestright`) depends on the actual values in `p` and the value of `furthestright`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need:
- `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, which suggests that `p` should have at least one more element that qualifies (i.e., `p[pidx]` must exist).
- Additionally, `p[pidx]` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

In conclusion, since `pidx` is defined as the number of elements in `p` that meet the condition, we need to ensure `furthestright` is greater than or equal to the next potential value in `p` at index `pidx`, and `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.

Thus, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute the first time could be summarized as:
- For the loop to execute, it is necessary that `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`.

State: **`pidx` is less than `len(p)`, and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`**.
