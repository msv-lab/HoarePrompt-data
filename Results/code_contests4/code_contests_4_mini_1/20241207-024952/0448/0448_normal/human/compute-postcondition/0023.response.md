According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pidx` and the length of the list `p`. For the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must hold true.

We know that `pidx` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration. However, since the previous value of `pidx` is not specified, we cannot definitively say what that value was, but we can derive conditions based on the current state:

1. After the increment, `pidx` is now one more than its previous value.
2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must still be less than `len(p)`, meaning that the initial value of `pidx` must be less than `len(p) - 1`.
3. Additionally, we do not have information about the value of `p[pidx]` after incrementing `pidx`, which means we cannot determine if `p[pidx] <= furthestright` holds true.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to ensure two conditions:
- The previous value of `pidx` must be such that after incrementing, it remains less than `len(p)`, specifically `pidx` must be less than or equal to `len(p) - 1`.
- The value of `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`pidx` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than or equal to `len(p) - 1` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
