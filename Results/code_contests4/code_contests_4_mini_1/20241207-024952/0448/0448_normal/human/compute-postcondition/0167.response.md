According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and the length of `p`. The loop condition is `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `pidx` is 1.
- `p` has at least one element, and `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must be less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since `pidx` is currently 1, we need to ensure `len(p)` is greater than 1. Additionally, `p[1]` must also be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `len(p)` must be greater than 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 1, `p` has at least one element, `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` is greater than 1 and `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
