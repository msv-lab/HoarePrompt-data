The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is not specified, but it is stated that `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. Therefore, after execution, `pidx` will be one greater than its previous value, but the exact new value is unknown. The other variables in the initial state are not directly affected. 

Output State: **`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); pidx` is incremented by 1.**
