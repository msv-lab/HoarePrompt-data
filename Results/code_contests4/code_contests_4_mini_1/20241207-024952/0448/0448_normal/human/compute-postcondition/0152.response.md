The variable `pidx` is assigned the value `0`. Other variables (`hidx`, `works`, `ss`, `avg`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, and `pidx` is 0.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, and `pidx` is 0.**
