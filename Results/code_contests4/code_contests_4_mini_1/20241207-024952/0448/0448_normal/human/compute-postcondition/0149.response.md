The variable `avg` is assigned the value of `(ss + ll) // 2`, where `ss` is equal to `avg`. Since `ss` is equal to `avg` for the loop to execute again, it means that `avg` is being recalculated based on its own value and `ll`. The specific values of `ss` and `ll` are not provided, but we know that `avg` will be the average of these two values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `avg` is recalculated but does not provide specific numerical values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, and `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2.**
