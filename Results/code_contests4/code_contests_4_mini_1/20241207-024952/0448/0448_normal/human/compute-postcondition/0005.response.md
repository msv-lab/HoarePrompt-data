The variable `avg` is assigned the value of `(ss + ll) // 2`. Given the initial state, `ss` is 0 and `ll` is 21000000000. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

1. Calculate `ss + ll` which is `0 + 21000000000 = 21000000000`.
2. Perform integer division by 2: `21000000000 // 2 = 10500000000`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `hi` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `pi` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers based on user input; `p` is a list of integers based on user input split and converted to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `hi` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `pi` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers based on user input; `p` is a list of integers based on user input split and converted to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000**.
