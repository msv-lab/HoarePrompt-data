The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. Since `pidx` was previously two greater than its value, it will now be three greater than its original value. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `len(p)` must be greater than the new value of `pidx`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is now three greater than its previous value, and the loop can still execute if `len(p)` is greater than this new `pidx`.

Output State: **`pidx` is now three greater than its previous value; for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than this new `pidx`.**
