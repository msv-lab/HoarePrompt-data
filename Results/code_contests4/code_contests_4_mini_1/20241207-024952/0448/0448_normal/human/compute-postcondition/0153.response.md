To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to examine the conditions in the `while` statement: `hidx < len(h) and pidx < len(p)`. For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions must be satisfied.

1. **Evaluate `hidx < len(h)`**:
   - Right before the loop, `hidx` is 0. For the first condition to hold true, `len(h)` must be greater than 0. This means that the list `h` must have at least one element.

2. **Evaluate `pidx < len(p)`**:
   - Similarly, `pidx` is also 0. For the second condition to hold true, `len(p)` must also be greater than 0. This indicates that the list `p` must have at least one element.

Since both `len(h)` and `len(p)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we can conclude that we need to ensure both lists are non-empty.

Thus, the modifications needed are:
- `len(h) > 0`
- `len(p) > 0`

There are no other states that need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `pidx` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then len(h) > 0 and len(p) > 0**
