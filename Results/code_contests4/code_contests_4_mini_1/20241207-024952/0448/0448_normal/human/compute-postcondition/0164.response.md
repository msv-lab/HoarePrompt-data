To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the code snippet provided, based on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `hidx` is 0
   - `works` is False
   - `ss` is equal to `avg`
   - `avg` is recalculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`
   - `pidx` is 0
   - `leftget` is the first element of `p`
   - `curpos` is the value of `h[0]`
   - `getbacktime` is `max(0, 2 * (h[0] - leftget))`
   - `alsotoright` is `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`
   - `leftime` is `max(0, curpos - leftget)`
   - `remtime` is `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` calculates the value of `furthestright`.
   - `curpos` is already determined as `h[0]`.
   - `alsotoright` and `remtime` are calculated based on the previously defined variables.

3. **Calculating `furthestright`**:
   - Assuming we have values for `h[0]`, `leftget`, `avg`, and `ll`, we can compute `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, and `remtime` accordingly.
   - The final value of `furthestright` would depend on the computed values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.

Given the initial state and the operations performed, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is the first element of `p`, `curpos` is the value of `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (h[0] - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**.
