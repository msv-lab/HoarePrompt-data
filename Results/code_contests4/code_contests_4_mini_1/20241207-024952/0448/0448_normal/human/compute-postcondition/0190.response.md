Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]` (if `pidx` is less than `len(p)`), otherwise `pidx` is equal to `len(p)` and no further element in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
