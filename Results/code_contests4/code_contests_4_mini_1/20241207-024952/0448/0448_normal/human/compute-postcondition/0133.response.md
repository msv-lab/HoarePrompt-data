According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop will execute again if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and if the value of `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must hold true.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `pidx` and `furthestright` appropriately. Since `pidx` is now one greater than its previous value, we need to ensure that `pidx` is still less than the length of `p`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` is still less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`, and `p[pidx]` must be adjusted to a value less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftime` is calculated as max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is calculated as max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); for the loop to execute again, len(p) must be greater than `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
