According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop will execute again if `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is now one greater than its previous value. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, which means that the length of the list `p` must be greater than the current value of `pidx`.
2. The value at `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since `pidx` has increased by one, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx + 1`, and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states accordingly to ensure that both conditions are satisfied.

State: **`pidx` is now one greater than its previous value, `furthestright` is unchanged, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
