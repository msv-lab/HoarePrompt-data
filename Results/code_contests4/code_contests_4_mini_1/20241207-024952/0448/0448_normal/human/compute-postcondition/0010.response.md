`leftget` is assigned the value `p[pidx]`, where `p` is a list and `pidx` is an index. Since the initial state indicates that `len(p) > 0`, this means there is at least one element in the list `p`, and thus `p[pidx]` will yield a valid value. The values of `n`, `m`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p.**
