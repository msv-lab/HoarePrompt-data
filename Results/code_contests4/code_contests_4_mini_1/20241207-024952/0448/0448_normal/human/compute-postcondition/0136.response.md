Output State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftime` is calculated as max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is calculated as max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is incremented by 1.**
