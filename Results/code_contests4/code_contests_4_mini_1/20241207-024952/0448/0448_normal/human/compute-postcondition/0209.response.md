Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; if `p` has no elements less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` remains 0. `alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime).**
