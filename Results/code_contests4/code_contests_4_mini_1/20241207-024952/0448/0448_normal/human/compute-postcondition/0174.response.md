`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, which means it takes the value from the list `p` at the index `pidx`. The state of the other variables, `hidx` and `pidx`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`, and `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]**
