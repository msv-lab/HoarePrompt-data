According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `hidx`, `len(h)`, `pidx`, and `len(p)`. The loop will execute again if both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `hidx` is 1,
- `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` (let's denote it as `lp`, so `pidx` is `lp`),
- `len(p)` is `lp`, meaning `pidx` is not less than `len(p)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must be adjusted to be less than `len(p)`. Since `p` has at least one element, `pidx` could be adjusted to be `lp - 1` (or any value less than `lp`).

No adjustments are needed for `hidx` or `ss`, `avg`, and other states mentioned as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`hidx` is 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`**
