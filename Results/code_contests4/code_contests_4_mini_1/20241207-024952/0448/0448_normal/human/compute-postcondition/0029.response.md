To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop statement: `hidx < len(h)` and `pidx < len(p)`.

From the provided state:
- `hidx` has been increased by 1, which means it is now one more than its previous value.
- `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`.

For the `while` loop to execute again:
1. `hidx` must still be less than `len(h)`. Since `hidx` has been incremented, it must be adjusted to ensure it is still less than the length of `h`.
2. `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`. The current state of `pidx` being equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright` does not guarantee that `pidx` is less than `len(p)`. We need to ensure that there are more elements in `p` than those counted by `pidx`.

Thus, to modify the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- We need to ensure that `hidx` is less than `len(h)` after it has been increased by 1.
- We need to ensure that `pidx` is strictly less than `len(p)`.

Assuming `len(h)` is greater than the current `hidx`, we can state:
- `hidx` must be adjusted such that it is less than `len(h)`.
- `pidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(p)`.

State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `hidx` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again, `hidx` needs to be less than `len(h)` and `pidx` needs to be less than `len(p)`**
