The code assigns the value `0` to `pidx`. Since `pidx` was previously equal to the number of elements in `p` that were less than or equal to `furthestright`, and now it is explicitly set to `0`, this indicates that there are no elements in `p` that meet the condition. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `pidx` and the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ll` is equal to `avg`, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2**
