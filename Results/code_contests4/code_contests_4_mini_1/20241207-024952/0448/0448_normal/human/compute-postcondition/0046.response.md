Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; if `pidx` was initially less than the length of `p`, then `furthestright` remains unchanged, and all elements in `p` up to `pidx` are less than or equal to `furthestright`. If `pidx` was initially equal to or greater than the length of `p`, the loop does not execute and `pidx` remains unchanged.**
