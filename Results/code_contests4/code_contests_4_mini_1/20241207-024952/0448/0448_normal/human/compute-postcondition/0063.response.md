To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions set by the `while` loop statement.

The loop condition is:
```
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
```

1. **First Condition**: `pidx < len(p)`
   - At the end of the last iteration, we know `pidx` is now two greater than its previous value. To ensure the loop can execute again, `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`.

2. **Second Condition**: `p[pidx] <= furthestright`
   - In the previous iteration, since the loop can execute again, it implies that `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. If this condition fails, we need to ensure that either `furthestright` is increased or `p[pidx]` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given that `pidx` is now two greater than its previous value, we need to adjust `len(p)` to ensure it is greater than `pidx`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments can be summarized as follows:

State: **`pidx` is now two greater than its previous value and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx`**.
