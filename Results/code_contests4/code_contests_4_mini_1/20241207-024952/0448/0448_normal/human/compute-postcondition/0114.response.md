According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, and `furthestright`. The loop will continue executing as long as `pidx` is less than the length of the list `p` and the current element `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `pidx` is still less than `len(p)` and that the next element `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Since `pidx` is now incremented by 1, we need to check if `pidx` is still valid (i.e., less than `len(p)`). This means that `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` after the increment, which requires `len(p)` to be greater than the original value of `pidx` before the increment.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is that `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` (the original value before the increment) to ensure that the loop can execute again.

State: **`furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; for the loop to execute again, len(p) must be greater than the original value of pidx before being incremented.**
