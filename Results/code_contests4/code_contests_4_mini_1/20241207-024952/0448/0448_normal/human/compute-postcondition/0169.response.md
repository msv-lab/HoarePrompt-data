To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we should analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop will continue running.

The loop condition is:
```
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
```

1. The first part of the condition, `pidx < len(p)`, checks if `pidx` is less than the length of the list `p`. We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `pidx` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 2.

2. The second part of the condition, `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, checks if the current element in `p` at index `pidx` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Given the current state:
- `hidx` is 0
- `works` is False
- `ss` is equal to `avg`
- `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`
- `pidx` is 2
- `p` has at least one element
- `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`
- `len(p)` is greater than 1
- `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- We need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than 2 (since `pidx` is currently 2).
- We also need to ensure that `p[2]` (the element at `pidx`) is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `len(p)` must be greater than 2.
- `p[2]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 2, `p` has at least one element, `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` is greater than 2 and `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright.**
