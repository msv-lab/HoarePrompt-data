To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the operation being performed.

Initial State:
- `hidx` is 0
- `works` is False
- `ss` is equal to `avg`
- `avg` is recalculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`
- `pidx` is 0
- `leftget` is the first element of `p`
- `curpos` is the value of `h[hidx]`
- `getbacktime` is `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`

The code snippet:
```
alsotoright = max(0, avg - getbacktime)
```

1. Calculate `getbacktime`:
   - `curpos` is the value of `h[hidx]`, where `hidx` is 0, so `curpos` is `h[0]`.
   - `leftget` is the first element of `p`.
   - `getbacktime` is thus `max(0, 2 * (h[0] - leftget))`.

2. Now compute `alsotoright`:
   - `alsotoright` is assigned the value `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
   - Since `avg` is defined as `(ss + ll) // 2`, this will determine the calculation.

We can summarize the outcomes based on the calculations with the affected variables. However, without specific values for `ss`, `ll`, `h[0]`, and `p`, we cannot provide exact numerical values, but we can describe the relationships and states of the variables.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is the first element of `p`, `curpos` is the value of `h[0]`, `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (h[0] - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime)**
