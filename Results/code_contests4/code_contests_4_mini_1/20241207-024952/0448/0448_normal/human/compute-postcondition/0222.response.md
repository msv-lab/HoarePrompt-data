The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `hi` and `pi`. `hi` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, where `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000` and each integer `hi` satisfies `1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^10`. `pi` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, where `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100000` and each integer `pi` satisfies `1 ≤ pi ≤ 10^10`. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the relationship between the values in the lists. However, the exact output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two lists of integers `hi` and `pi`, both of which contain distinct integers sorted in ascending order, and to perform operations based on those inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `hi` and `pi`, where `hi` is a list of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order and `pi` is a list of m distinct integers sorted in ascending order.**
