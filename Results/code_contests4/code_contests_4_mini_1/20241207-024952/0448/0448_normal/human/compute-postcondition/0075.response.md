Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, and if `works` is True, then `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`. If `works` remains False, then `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`.***
