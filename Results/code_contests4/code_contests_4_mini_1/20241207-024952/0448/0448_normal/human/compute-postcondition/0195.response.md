The code sets the variable `works` to `False`, changing its previous state. The values of the other variables (`pidx`, `furthestright`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`; `hidx` is incremented by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `works` is False.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`; `hidx` is incremented by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `works` is False.**
