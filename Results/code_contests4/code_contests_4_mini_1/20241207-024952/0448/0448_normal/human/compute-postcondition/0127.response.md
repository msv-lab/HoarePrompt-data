To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the effect of the provided code snippet.

1. `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
2. `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
3. `getbacktime` is calculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.

Now, `alsotoright` is calculated using the formula `alsotoright = max(0, avg - getbacktime)`. 

From the initial state, we have:
- `leftget` from the array `p` at index `pidx`.
- `curpos` from the array `h` at index `hidx`.
- `getbacktime` is determined based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`.

The variable `avg` is not defined within the provided state, and thus we cannot evaluate `alsotoright` fully without knowing the value of `avg`. However, we can state that `alsotoright` will depend on the calculation of `getbacktime`.

Thus, the output state reflects the current known variables and their relationships, noting the dependency on `avg`.

Output State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), and `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime)**.
