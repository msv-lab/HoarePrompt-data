According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `hidx`, `len(h)`, `pidx`, and `len(p)`. The loop will continue as long as both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `works` is False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `hidx` must be less than `len(h)` and `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`. Since we do not have information about the values of `len(h)` and `len(p)` or the specific value of `pidx`, we cannot definitively determine the exact adjustments needed for them.

However, we can state that for the loop to execute again:
- `hidx` must remain less than `len(h)`.
- `pidx` must remain less than `len(p)`.

Thus, we need to ensure:
- If `len(h)` is greater than 1, then `hidx` can remain 1.
- If `pidx` is currently equal to `len(p)`, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(p)`.

State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, and for the loop to execute again `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`**.
