The code assigns `leftime` the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`. The variables impacted are `curpos` and `leftget`. The value of `curpos` is already assigned based on the value of `h[hidx]`, and `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`. Since `curpos` and `leftget` are integers based on user input, the result of `curpos - leftget` could be either positive, zero, or negative.

If `curpos - leftget` is positive, `leftime` will take that value. If it is zero, `leftime` will be zero. If it is negative, `leftime` will be zero because of the `max(0, ...)` function.

Therefore, the output states are:
- `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`
- `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`
- `leftime` will be either `curpos - leftget` if positive or zero.

Output State: **`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` if positive or zero.**
