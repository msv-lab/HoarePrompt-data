Output State: **`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); pidx` is currently greater than its previous value; for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than the current value of `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`; `pidx` is incremented by 1.**
