Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ll` is equal to `avg`, `ss` is less than `ll`, `leftget` is equal to p[0], `curpos` is equal to h[0], `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (h[0] - p[0])), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is calculated as max(0, curpos - leftget)**
