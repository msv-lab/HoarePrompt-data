The value of `works` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `works` was `True`, so after execution, `works` is now `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is the first element of `p`, `curpos` is the value of `h[hidx]`, and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`.
