Output State: **`pidx` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `hidx` is increased by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `getbacktime` is assigned the value max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)); `alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned the value max(0, curpos - leftget).**
