The variable `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`. The previous value of `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, but since the exact values of `ss` and `ll` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value for `avg`. However, we know that `ll` now holds the same value as `avg`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `furthestright` for the last `hidx`, and `ll` is equal to `avg`.**
