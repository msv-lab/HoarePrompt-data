The code assigns the value of `p[pidx]` to `leftget`. The variable `pidx` is currently 0, so `leftget` will be assigned the first element of the list `p`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `pidx` is 0, and `leftget` is the first element of `p`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is the first element of `p`**
