According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop will execute again if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`, and `pidx` has been increased by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `p[pidx]` (which is the new value after increment) must still be less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` after incrementing is less than or equal to `furthestright`. This requires that the previous value of `p[pidx]` (before increment) was at most `furthestright`.

State: **`furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]` and for the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than len(p) and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
