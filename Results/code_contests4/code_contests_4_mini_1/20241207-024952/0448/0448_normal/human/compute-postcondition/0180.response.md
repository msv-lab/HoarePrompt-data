To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial state of the variables and how the code affects them.

Initial State:
- `hidx` is 1
- `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`
- `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]`
- `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[1]`
- `getbacktime` is calculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`

In the code snippet:
```
alsotoright = max(0, avg - getbacktime)
```

We observe the following:
1. `avg` is referenced but not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute `alsotoright` directly without knowing the value of `avg`.
2. The value of `getbacktime` has already been calculated based on `curpos` and `leftget`.

As a result, we have:
- The state of `curpos` and `leftget` is known, and `getbacktime` has been computed.
- However, since `avg` is not provided, we can't determine `alsotoright`.

The output state will reflect the known values and the fact that `alsotoright` cannot be determined because of the undefined `avg`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[1]`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), and alsotoright cannot be computed due to undefined avg.**
