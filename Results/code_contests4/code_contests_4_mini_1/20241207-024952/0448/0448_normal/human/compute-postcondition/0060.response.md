The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. Since `pidx` is initially less than `len(p)`, it will now be one step closer to reaching the length of `p`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is now one greater than its previous value, while `furthestright` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`pidx` is now one greater than its previous value, `furthestright` is unchanged.**
