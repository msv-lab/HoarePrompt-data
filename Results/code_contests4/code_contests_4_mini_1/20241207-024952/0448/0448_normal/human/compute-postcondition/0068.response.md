Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, `works` remains True if all conditions were satisfied during the iterations, otherwise it is False. Additionally, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`.***
