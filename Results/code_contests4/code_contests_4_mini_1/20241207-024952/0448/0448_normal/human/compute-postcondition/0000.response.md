The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the input, which are two integers provided by the user. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified, but they must remain within the range of 1 to 100000. The lists `hi` and `pi` are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `m` are now integers based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `hi` is a list of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `pi` is a list of m distinct integers sorted in ascending order.**
