The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`; `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
