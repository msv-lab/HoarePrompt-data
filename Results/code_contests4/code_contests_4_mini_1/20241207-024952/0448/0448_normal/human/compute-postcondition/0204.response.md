The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, but the state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is incremented by 1.**
