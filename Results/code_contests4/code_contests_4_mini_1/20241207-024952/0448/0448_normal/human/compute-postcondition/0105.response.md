The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `leftget` is equal to p[pidx] (if pidx is less than len(p)), `curpos` is equal to h[1], `works` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
