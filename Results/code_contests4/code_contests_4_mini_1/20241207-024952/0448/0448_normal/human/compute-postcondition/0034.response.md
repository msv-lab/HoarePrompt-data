Postcondition: ***`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `hidx` is increased by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, and `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
