To determine the conditions necessary for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```python
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute as long as two conditions are satisfied:

1. `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`.
2. The value at index `pidx` in the list `p` (`p[pidx]`) must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since we know that `furthestright` is derived from `curpos` and depends on `alsotoright` and `remtime`, we don't have a numeric value for `furthestright` without additional context. 

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure:

- `pidx` is within the bounds of the array `p`, so `pidx` should be less than `len(p)`.
- The value of `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since we don't have information about the current values of `pidx` and `len(p)`, we can assume that `pidx` should be initialized to 0 or a value less than `len(p)`. Without knowing the current value of `p[pidx]`, we can't definitively state what `furthestright` must be, but we can imply that it should be greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`.

Here's the revised program state to allow the loop to execute:

State: **`furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`**
