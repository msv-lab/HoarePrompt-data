The value of `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`. The previous value of `curpos` and `leftget` is unknown, but they will affect the calculation of `leftime`. The value of `alsotoright` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the value `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`; `leftime` is assigned the value `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.

Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the value max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned the value max(0, curpos - leftget)**
