The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pidx` is unknown. The other variables (`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); and `pidx` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); `pidx` is increased by 1.**
