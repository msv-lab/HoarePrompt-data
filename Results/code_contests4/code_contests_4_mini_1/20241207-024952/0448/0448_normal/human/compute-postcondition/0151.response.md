The value of `hidx` is reassigned to 0. The previous value of `hidx` was equal to the length of `h`, but it is now set to 0, which means that `hidx` has changed. The other variables `works`, `ss`, and `avg` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, and `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, and `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2.**
