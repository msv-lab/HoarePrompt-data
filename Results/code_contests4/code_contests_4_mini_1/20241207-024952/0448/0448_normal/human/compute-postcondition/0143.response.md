Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` if all elements in `p` are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`; otherwise, `pidx` is the first index in `p` that exceeds `furthestright`. `works` is True, indicating that the condition `curpos - leftget > avg` was not met in any iteration. If `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`, the state of the variables is updated accordingly.***
