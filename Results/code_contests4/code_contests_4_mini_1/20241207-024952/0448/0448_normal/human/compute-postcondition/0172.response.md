The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `p` has at least one element, and all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `furthestright`.
