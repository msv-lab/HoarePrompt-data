To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop. The loop will execute as long as both conditions `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright` are true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `hidx` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `pidx` is 2
- `works` is False (not relevant to the loop condition)

The first condition, `pidx < len(p)`, means that `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. Since `pidx` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The second condition, `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, means that the value at index `pidx` of the list `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since `pidx` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `p[2]` is less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. The length of `p` must be greater than 2: `len(p)` should be greater than 2.
2. The value at index 2 of `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`: `p[2]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 2, for the loop to execute again `len(p)` is greater than 2 and `p[2]` is less than or equal to furthestright**.
