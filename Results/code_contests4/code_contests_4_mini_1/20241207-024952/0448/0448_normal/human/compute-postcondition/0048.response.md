According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `hidx`, `len(h)`, `pidx`, and `len(p)`. The loop will continue if both conditions are satisfied: `hidx` must be less than `len(h)` and `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` has been increased by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `hidx` must still be less than `len(h)`. 

Since `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` will only allow the loop to continue if it is less than `len(p)`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `hidx` should be less than `len(h)`, and `pidx` should also be less than `len(p)`. Therefore, `hidx` must currently be less than `len(h)` (which is true since it was just increased by 1) and `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`.

State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, hidx is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again, hidx must be less than len(h) and pidx must be less than len(p)**
