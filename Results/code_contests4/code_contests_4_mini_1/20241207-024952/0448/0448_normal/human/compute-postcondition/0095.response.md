According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, and `furthestright`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and the value `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is 1.

Since `pidx` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, which is not guaranteed without knowing the length of the list `p`. Additionally, `p[pidx]` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to guarantee that:
- `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, meaning `len(p)` must be greater than 1.
- The value `p[1]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `len(p)` is greater than 1
- `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 1, `works` is False, for the loop to execute again `len(p)` is greater than 1 and `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
