Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. If the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
