Postcondition: ***`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `leftget` is equal to `p[pidx]` (if `pidx` is less than `len(p)`), `curpos` is equal to `h[1]`, if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
