To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to examine the conditions that must be satisfied by the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`.

1. **Understanding the Loop Conditions**: 
   The loop will execute while both `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright` are true. This means:
   - `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`.
   - The value `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `furthestright` is computed as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, which ensures that `furthestright` is non-negative, depending on the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.
   - `pidx` is an index that must be valid for access to the list `p`.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - To ensure that the loop can execute:
     - `pidx` needs to be initialized at a value such that it is less than `len(p)`. Therefore, `pidx` should be less than the length of `p`, which implies that `p` needs to have at least one element.
     - Additionally, the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` indicates that the current element of `p` at index `pidx` must be less than or equal to the calculated `furthestright`.

Given these considerations, we can summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- Ensure that `p` is not empty (has at least one element) so that `len(p) > 0`.
- Ensure that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Thus, we can express the necessary adjustments clearly:

State: **`alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); for the loop to execute the first time then p must have at least one element and p[pidx] must be less than or equal to furthestright.**
