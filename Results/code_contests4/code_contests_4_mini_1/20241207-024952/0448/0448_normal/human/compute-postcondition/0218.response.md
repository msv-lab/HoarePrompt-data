The value of `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`. The previous value of `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, and since `ss` is equal to `avg`, we can infer that `avg` is at least `0` (if `ss` is non-negative). Therefore, `ss` will be `avg + 1`, which will be greater than `avg`. The values of `hidx`, `works`, `pidx`, and the condition involving `p` and `furthestright` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `furthestright` for the last `hidx`, and if `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`, the condition is satisfied.**
