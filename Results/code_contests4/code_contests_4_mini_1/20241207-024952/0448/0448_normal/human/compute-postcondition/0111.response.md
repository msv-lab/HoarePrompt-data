To evaluate the provided code snippet based on the initial state, we first need to break down the existing variables:

1. `getbacktime` is calculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.
2. `alsotoright` is calculated as `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
3. `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
4. `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

Now let's analyze the impact of the statement:

```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

This line assigns the value of `furthestright` based on the current position `curpos` and the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`. The values of `alsotoright` and `remtime` are determined from the previous calculations. 

Since `curpos`, `leftget`, `avg`, etc., are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine exact values for `furthestright`, `alsotoright`, or `remtime`.

However, we can summarize that the variable `furthestright` has been computed based on the maximum values of `alsotoright` and `remtime` added to `curpos`. The exact output state would then indicate the dependency of `furthestright` on these variables, reflecting that the calculation has occurred.

Output State: **`furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` based on previous values.**
