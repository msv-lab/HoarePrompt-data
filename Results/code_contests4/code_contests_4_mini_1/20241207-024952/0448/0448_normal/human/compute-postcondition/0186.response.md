According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, and `p[pidx]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` has been increased by 1 and is now less than `len(p)`, which means `pidx` must still be valid for the current length of `p`. However, it also states that `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` is still less than or equal to `furthestright` after the increment.

Since `pidx` is now less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`, we need to ensure that `p[pidx]` remains valid and satisfies the condition for another iteration.

Thus, we can state:
State: **`furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]` and for the loop to execute again, `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
