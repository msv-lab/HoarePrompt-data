To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `hidx` is 1
   - `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but depends on the length of the list `p`.
   - `leftget` is `p[len(p) - 1]`, which also depends on `p`.
   - `curpos` is `h[1]`, which is based on the list `h`.
   - `leftime` is `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, which calculates the maximum value between 0 and `curpos - leftget`.
   - `remtime` depends on `avg`, which is not defined.

2. **Code Execution:**
   The line of code `furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` calculates `furthestright` based on `curpos` and the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`. However, we do not have explicit values for `alsotoright`, `remtime`, or `avg`. 

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `furthestright` is assigned a new value based on the calculation.
   - The values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` are required to fully determine `furthestright`, but since `alsotoright` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact value of `furthestright`.

4. **Output State:**
   Since `furthestright` is derived from `curpos` and needs other variables that depend on external states, we state that `furthestright` is assigned a value that cannot be fully determined without knowing `alsotoright` and `remtime`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`, `leftget` is `p[len(p) - 1]`, `curpos` is `h[1]`, `leftime` is `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `furthestright` is assigned a value based on `curpos` and the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.**
