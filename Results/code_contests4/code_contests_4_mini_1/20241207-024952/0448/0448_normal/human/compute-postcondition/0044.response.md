To determine what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. The loop continues as long as `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
   - `pidx` is currently greater than its previous value (indicating it has been incremented).
   - For the loop to execute again, we require:
     - `len(p)` must be greater than the current value of `pidx`.
     - `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given this information, the following adjustments can be made:

- Since `pidx` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `len(p)` is greater than `pidx` (which means `len(p)` must be greater than the new value of `pidx`).
- We also need to check the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, which means that the current value of `p[pidx]` must be such that it satisfies this condition.

Thus, the current state indicates that `pidx` has been incremented, and we need to ensure that these two conditions hold true for the loop to run again.

State: **`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); pidx` is currently greater than its previous value; for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than the current value of `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
