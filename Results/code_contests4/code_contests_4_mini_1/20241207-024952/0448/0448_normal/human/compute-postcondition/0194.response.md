The value of `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. The variable `hidx` has been incremented by 1 before this assignment, so `curpos` will hold the value from the `h` list at the new index `hidx`. The values of `pidx`, `furthestright`, and `leftget` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`; `hidx` is incremented by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`; `hidx` is incremented by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.**
