To determine if the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the conditions provided in the loop statement: `while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:`. 

1. The variable `pidx` is currently 0. This means for the loop to execute, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`. Therefore, `len(p)` must be greater than 0.

2. The second condition checks if `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since `pidx` is 0, this translates to `p[0] <= furthestright`. 

Now, letâ€™s break down the calculation of `furthestright`:
- `curpos` is `h[0]`.
- `alsotoright` is calculated as `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
- `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.
- Thus, `furthestright` becomes `curpos + max(0, avg - getbacktime) + max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need:
- `len(p) > 0` (which means `p` has at least one element),
- `p[0]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

If `p` is empty or `p[0]` is greater than `furthestright`, the loop will not execute. 

Now, the initial state indicates that `works` is False, but since it doesn't affect the loop's execution conditions directly, we focus on `p` and `furthestright`.

Assuming `avg`, `getbacktime`, and `leftime` are such that `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[0]`, we can conclude the necessary conditions.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once:
1. Ensure `len(p) > 0`.
2. Ensure `p[0] <= furthestright`.

State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `len(p)` is greater than 0 and `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
