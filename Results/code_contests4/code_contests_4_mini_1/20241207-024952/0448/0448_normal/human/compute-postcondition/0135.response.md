To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop condition:

```
while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:
```

The loop will continue executing as long as both conditions are satisfied:
1. `pidx` must be less than the length of `p` (i.e., `pidx < len(p)`).
2. The value at `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright` (i.e., `p[pidx] <= furthestright`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `pidx` has just been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `pidx` should still be less than `len(p)`, which means it should be adjusted to be less than `len(p)`.
- The value of `p[pidx]` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since we have not been given specific values for `p`, `furthestright`, and the length of `p`, we can state the necessary adjustments based on the conditions mentioned.

State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftime` is calculated as max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is calculated as max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is calculated as curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); for the loop to execute again, `pidx` must be less than len(p) and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
