Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `furthestright` is greater than or equal to `p[pidx]`; `hidx` is incremented by 1; `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; if `curpos` minus `leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `getbacktime` is assigned the value max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)).**
