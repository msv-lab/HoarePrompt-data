The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ll` is equal to `avg`, `ss` is less than `ll`, `leftget` is equal to p[0], `curpos` is equal to h[0], and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
