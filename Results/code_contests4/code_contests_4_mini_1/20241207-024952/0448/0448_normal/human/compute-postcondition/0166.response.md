The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pidx` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `pidx` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 1, `p` has at least one element, `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 1, `p` has at least one element, `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
