According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, and `furthestright`. The loop can execute again if `pidx` is less than the length of the list `p` and if the current element `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Since `pidx` was incremented, it is now at least equal to its previous value plus one. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than this new value of `pidx`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` holds.

Thus, we can summarize that:
1. `len(p)` must be greater than the incremented `pidx`.
2. `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); and for the loop to execute again, len(p) must be greater than pidx and p[pidx] must be less than or equal to furthestright.**
