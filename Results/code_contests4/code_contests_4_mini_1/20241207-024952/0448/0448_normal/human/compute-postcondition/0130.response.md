To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impacts based on the initial values of the variables involved.

1. **Initial Assignments:**
   - `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
   - `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
   - `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
   - `remtime` is calculated as `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

2. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The expression `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.
   - Here, `curpos` is already defined, and the value of `remtime` is dependent on the previously calculated values.

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The variable `furthestright` will hold the result of `curpos` plus the maximum of `alsotoright` and `remtime`.
   - The values of `leftget`, `curpos`, `leftime`, and `remtime` remain unchanged by this line of code.

4. **Final State:**
   - The values of the variables `leftget`, `curpos`, `leftime`, and `remtime` remain as initially calculated, while `furthestright` has now been computed.

Output State: **`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftime` is calculated as max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is calculated as max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), and `furthestright` is calculated as curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime).**
