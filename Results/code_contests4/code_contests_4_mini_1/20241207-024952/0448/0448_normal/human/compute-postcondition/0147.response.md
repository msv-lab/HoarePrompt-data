Postcondition: ***`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`. If `works` is True, then `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` if all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `furthestright`; otherwise, `pidx` is the first index in `p` that exceeds `furthestright`, and `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`. If `works` is False, then `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` if all elements in `p` are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`; otherwise, `pidx` is the first index in `p` that exceeds `furthestright`, `works` is False, and `ss` is equal to `avg + 1.***
