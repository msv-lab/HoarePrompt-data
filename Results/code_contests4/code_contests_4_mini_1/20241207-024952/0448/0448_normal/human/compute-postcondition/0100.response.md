The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `pidx` and `works` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `works` is False. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `works` is False**
