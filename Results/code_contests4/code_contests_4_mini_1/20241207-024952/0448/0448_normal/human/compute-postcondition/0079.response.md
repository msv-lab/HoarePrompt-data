The value of `hidx` is assigned to 0, overwriting its previous value, which was the length of `h`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, `works` is True, `ll` is equal to `avg`, `ss` is less than `ll`, `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2.
