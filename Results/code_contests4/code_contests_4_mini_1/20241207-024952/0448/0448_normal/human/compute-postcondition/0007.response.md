The variable `hidx` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any of the previously defined variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `hi`, `pi`, `h`, `p`, `ss`, `ll`, `avg`, and `works` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `hi` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `pi` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers based on user input; `p` is a list of integers based on user input split and converted to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000; `works` is True; `hidx` is 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `hi` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `pi` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers based on user input; `p` is a list of integers based on user input split and converted to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000; `avg` is 10500000000; `works` is True; `hidx` is 0.**
