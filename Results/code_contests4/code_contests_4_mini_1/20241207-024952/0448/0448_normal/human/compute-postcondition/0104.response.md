The value of `works` is assigned `False`, but this does not affect any of the other variables (`hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the new value of `works`. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`; `leftget` is equal to p[pidx] (if pidx is less than len(p)); `curpos` is equal to h[1]; `works` is False**
