The variable `works` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[1]`, and `works` is False. 

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[1]`, and `works` is False.**
