According to the code, the loop can execute again if both conditions in the `while` statement are satisfied: `pidx` must be less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` was incremented by 1, so it is now one greater than its value at the start of this iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be less than `len(p)`, which means `len(p)` must be greater than the current value of `pidx`. 

Additionally, `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. Since the current state does not provide explicit values for `furthestright` or `p[pidx]`, we cannot directly state them; however, for the loop to execute again, `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime); pidx` is currently greater than its previous value and for the loop to execute again `len(p)` must be greater than the current value of `pidx` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
