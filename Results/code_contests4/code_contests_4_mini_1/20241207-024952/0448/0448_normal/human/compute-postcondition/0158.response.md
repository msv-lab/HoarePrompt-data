The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is the first element of `p`, `curpos` is the value of `h[hidx]`, and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
