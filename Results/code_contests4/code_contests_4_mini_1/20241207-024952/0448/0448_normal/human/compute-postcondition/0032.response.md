The value of `works` is assigned `False`. The values of the other variables (`pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `hidx` is increased by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, and `works` is set to False.

Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `hidx` is increased by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, and `works` is set to False.**
