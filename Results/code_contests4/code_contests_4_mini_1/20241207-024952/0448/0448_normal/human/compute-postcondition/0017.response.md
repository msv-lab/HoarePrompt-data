The value of `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`. The variables `avg` and `getbacktime` are involved in this calculation. The value of `getbacktime` is previously calculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, but the specific values of `curpos`, `leftget`, and `avg` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical outcome of `alsotoright`. However, we know that `alsotoright` will be either `0` or a positive value depending on the result of the calculation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`; `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)); `alsotoright` is either 0 or a positive value based on the calculation involving `avg` and `getbacktime`.
