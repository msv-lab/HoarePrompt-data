To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `ss < ll`. 

From the provided state:
- `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, which does not affect the loop.
- The variable `ss` is currently equal to `avg + 1` because `works` is False.
- The variable `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`.

Now, substituting the values:
- Since `ss = avg + 1` and `ll = avg`, we have:
  \[
  ss = avg + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad ll = avg
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  avg + 1 < avg \quad \text{is not true.}
  \]

For the loop to execute one more time, we need `ss` to be less than `ll`. Therefore, we need to adjust `ss` so that it becomes less than `ll`. 

To achieve this, we can modify `ss` to be equal to `avg` instead of `avg + 1`. Thus, we need to adjust `ss` as follows:

State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg` for the loop to execute again**.
