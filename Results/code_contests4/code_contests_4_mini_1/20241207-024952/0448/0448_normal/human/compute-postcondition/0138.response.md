The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `hidx` is increased by 1. The value of `pidx` and `furthestright` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **variable `hidx` is increased by 1; `pidx` is equal to the first index in `p` that is greater than `furthestright`, or `len(p)` if all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `furthestright`**
