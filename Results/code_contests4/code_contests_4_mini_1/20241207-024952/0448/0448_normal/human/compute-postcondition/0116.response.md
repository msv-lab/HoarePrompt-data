According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx` and the length of `p`. The loop will continue executing as long as `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`, meaning that the original value of `pidx` must have been less than `len(p) - 1` before the increment. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the condition regarding `len(p)` to ensure that it is greater than the original value of `pidx` before being incremented, which means that `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` (the value before incrementing).

State: **`furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`; for the loop to execute again, len(p) must be greater than the original value of `pidx` before being incremented.**
