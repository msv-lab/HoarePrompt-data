To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop operates. The loop's condition is `pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The first part of the condition, `pidx < len(p)`, indicates that `pidx` must be a valid index within the bounds of the list `p`. This condition will be satisfied if `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.
   - The second part, `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, requires that the value at index `pidx` of the list `p` is less than or equal to the calculated value `furthestright`.

2. **Current State:**
   - The current value of `pidx` is not specified, but it must be adjusted to ensure it is within the bounds of the list `p`.
   - The value `furthestright` is calculated based on `curpos` and `remtime`, which are dependent on `leftime` and `alsotoright`. We need to ensure that at least one value in `p` at index `pidx` satisfies the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright`.

3. **Adjustment Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute, `pidx` must be less than `len(p)`, meaning `pidx` should be at least `0` and less than the size of `p`.
   - Additionally, `p[pidx]` must not exceed `furthestright`. If `furthestright` is not sufficient, we may need to adjust the values that contribute to its calculation (like `alsotoright` or `curpos`).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, we can adjust the state to ensure that `pidx` is valid and that `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `leftime` is either `curpos - leftget` if positive or zero; `remtime` is calculated as max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to furthestright.`
