Postcondition: ***`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `pidx` is less than len(p), `hidx` is less than len(h) - 1; `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `works`.***
