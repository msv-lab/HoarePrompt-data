The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[1]`, and `works` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
