The variables `ss` and `ll` are assigned the values `0` and `int(21000000000.0)` respectively. The value of `ss` is set to `0`, while `ll` is set to the integer value of `21000000000.0`, which is `21000000000`. The values of `n`, `m`, `hi`, `pi`, `h`, and `p` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `ss` and `ll`, and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on user input; `hi` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `pi` is a list of `m` distinct integers sorted in ascending order; `h` is a list of integers based on user input; `p` is a list of integers based on user input split and converted to integers; `ss` is 0; `ll` is 21000000000.**
