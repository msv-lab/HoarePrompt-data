The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, but after this operation, `pidx` will be one unit greater than its previous value. The conditions for the loop to execute again are still dependent on the values of `len(p)` and `furthestright`, which are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `pidx`.

Output State: **`pidx` has been increased by 1**
