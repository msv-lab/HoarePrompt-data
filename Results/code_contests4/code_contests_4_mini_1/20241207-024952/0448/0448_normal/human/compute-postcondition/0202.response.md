To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first analyze the initial state of the variables:

- `alsotoright` is assigned the value `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`.
- `leftime` is assigned the value `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
- `remtime` is assigned the value `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`.

Next, we examine the line of code that is executed:

```
furthestright = curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)
```

This line calculates `furthestright` by taking `curpos` and adding the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`.

Since `alsotoright`, `remtime`, and `curpos` are used in this calculation, their values will directly impact the result. However, we do not have the specific values for `avg`, `getbacktime`, `curpos`, and `leftget`, so we cannot compute a specific numeric outcome for `furthestright`.

Thus, the output state reflects the results of the calculations based on the initial assignments without providing specific numeric values:

Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned max(0, avg - getbacktime); `leftime` is assigned max(0, curpos - leftget); `remtime` is assigned max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2); `furthestright` is assigned curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)**.
