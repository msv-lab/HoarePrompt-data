According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between `ss` and `ll`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ss` is less than `ll`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`
- `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`
- If `works` is True, then `ll` is assigned the value of `avg`
- If `works` remains False, then `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`

Since `ss` is either equal to `avg + 1` (if `works` is False) or could be less than or equal to `avg` (if `works` is True), we need to ensure that `ss` is less than `ll` for the loop to execute again.

1. If `works` is True, then `ll` equals `avg`. In this case, `ss` must be less than `avg` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `ss` needs to be adjusted to be less than `avg`, so it could be `ss` is equal to `avg - 1`.

2. If `works` is False, then `ss` is equal to `avg + 1`, and `ll` would be less than or equal to `avg`. In this case, `ss` cannot be less than or equal to `ll`, so we must adjust `ll` to be greater than `avg + 1`. Thus, we can say `ll` is equal to `avg + 2` or more.

In both scenarios, we must adjust one of the states to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the last calculated `furthestright`, if `works` is True then `ll` is equal to `avg`, if `works` is False then for the loop to execute again `ss` is less than `ll`**
