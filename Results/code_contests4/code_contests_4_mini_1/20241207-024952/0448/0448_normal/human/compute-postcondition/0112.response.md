To determine whether the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop statement: `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. 

1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - The first condition, `pidx < len(p)`, implies that `pidx` must be less than the length of the list `p`. This means that `pidx` should be a valid index for the list `p`.
   - The second condition, `p[pidx] <= furthestright`, indicates that the value at the current index `pidx` in list `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

2. **Current State**:
   - The current state before the loop mentions that `furthestright` has been calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. The exact values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` are not provided, but `furthestright` is dependent on these calculations.
   - The variable `pidx` must also be defined and initialized to ensure the conditions can be evaluated.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
     - `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`. Therefore, if `p` currently has a size of `N`, then `pidx` must be less than `N`.
     - The value `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. This means that the list `p` should have at least one element that satisfies this condition.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - If `pidx` is set to 0 or another valid index and `len(p)` is greater than `pidx`, then we can ensure that `pidx < len(p)`.
   - We also need to ensure that `furthestright` is sufficiently large to satisfy `p[pidx] <= furthestright` for the first iteration.

Thus, to modify the state for the loop to execute, we can summarize that `pidx` should be a valid index (less than the length of `p`), and `furthestright` should be greater than or equal to the value of `p[pidx]`.

State: **`furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.**
