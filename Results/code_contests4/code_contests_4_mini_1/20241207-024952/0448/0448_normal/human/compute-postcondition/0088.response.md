Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ll` is equal to `avg`, `ss` is less than `ll`, `leftget` is equal to p[0], `curpos` is equal to h[0], `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), and if the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
