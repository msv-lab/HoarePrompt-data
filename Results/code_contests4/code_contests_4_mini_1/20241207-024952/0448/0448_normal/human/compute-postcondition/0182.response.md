To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code on the initial state.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `hidx` is 1
   - `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1`
   - `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[len(p) - 1]`
   - `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[1]`
   - `leftime` is calculated as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`

2. **Calculation of `remtime`**:
   - The variable `avg` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
   - `leftime` is already defined as `max(0, curpos - leftget)`.
   - Thus, `remtime = max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)` depends on the value of `avg`.

Since we cannot determine the value of `avg`, we cannot compute `remtime`. However, we note that the state of `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, and `leftime` is established, but `remtime` remains dependent on `avg`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 1, `pidx` is adjusted to `len(p) - 1, `leftget` is `p[len(p) - 1]`, `curpos` is `h[1]`, `leftime` is `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, and `remtime` depends on `avg`.**
