`pidx` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1. Therefore, after execution, `pidx` becomes 2. The states of the other variables, `hidx` and `works`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 2, `works` is False.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 2, `works` is False**
