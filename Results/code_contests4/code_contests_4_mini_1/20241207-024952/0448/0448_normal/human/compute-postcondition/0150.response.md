The variable `works` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `works` was `False`, but the other variables (`hidx`, `ss`, and `avg`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, and `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2.

Output State: **`hidx` is equal to the length of `h`, `works` is True, `ss` is equal to `avg`, and `avg` is recalculated as (ss + ll) // 2.**
