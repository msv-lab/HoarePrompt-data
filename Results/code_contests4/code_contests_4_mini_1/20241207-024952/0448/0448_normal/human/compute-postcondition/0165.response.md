To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions provided in the while loop statement.

The loop condition is `while pidx < len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright:`. This means that the loop can execute if both conditions are satisfied:

1. `pidx < len(p)`: This indicates that `pidx` must be less than the length of the array `p`. If `p` has no elements, `len(p)` is 0, and `pidx` must be at least 0 to allow for the loop to execute.
2. `p[pidx] <= furthestright`: This requires that the element at index `pidx` in the list `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `hidx` is 0
- `works` is False
- `ss` is equal to `avg`
- `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`
- `pidx` is 0
- `leftget` is the first element of `p`
- `curpos` is the value of `h[0]`
- `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (h[0] - leftget))
- `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime)
- `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget)
- `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)
- `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`

Steps to evaluate:
- We need to ensure that `pidx < len(p)`. This means that `len(p)` must be greater than `pidx` (which is currently 0). Therefore, `p` must have at least one element.
- We also need to ensure that the first element of `p` (i.e., `p[0]`) is less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to execute.

To summarize, we need:
1. `p` must have at least one element.
2. `p[0]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Since `furthestright` is dependent on `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, we also have to ensure these calculations yield a valid value compared to `p[0]`.

Thus, the required adjustments can be articulated as follows:

State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 0, `p` has at least one element, `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
