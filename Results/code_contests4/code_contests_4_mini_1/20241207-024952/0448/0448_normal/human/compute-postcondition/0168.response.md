The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `pidx` is 1. After execution, `pidx` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 2, `p` has at least one element, `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` is greater than 1 and `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Output State: **`hidx` is 0, `works` is False, `ss` is equal to `avg`, `avg` is calculated as `(ss + ll) // 2`, `pidx` is 2, `p` has at least one element, `p[0]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` is greater than 1 and `p[1]` is less than or equal to `furthestright.**
