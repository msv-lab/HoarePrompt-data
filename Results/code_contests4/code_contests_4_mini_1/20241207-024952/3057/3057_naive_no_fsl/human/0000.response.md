Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the k-th element in the generated sequence according to the problem description.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider an input where `n = 3` and `k = 4`. The expected sequence after (n - 1) steps is `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]`, and the element at index 4 is `3`. However, the program logic does not properly construct the sequence and instead attempts to calculate the k-th element based on index manipulation without considering the actual sequence structure.

Additionally, the program has a logic flaw in the way it determines the left and right bounds and does not accurately compute the middle position, leading to incorrect results for various indices, especially when `k` is not in the expected order.

For instance, if we input `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the program will not return `3` as expected but will likely return an incorrect output due to its flawed calculation approach. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem for at least one input case, confirming its correctness as **False**.
