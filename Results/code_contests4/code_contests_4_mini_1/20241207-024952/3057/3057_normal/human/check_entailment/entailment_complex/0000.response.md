The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement for generating the sequence and finding the k-th element. Here are the issues that lead to its incorrectness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is reading the input using `raw_input()` (which is correct for Python 2 but not used in Python 3 where `input()` should be used). 

2. **Logic for Finding k-th Element**: The program attempts to use a binary search-like approach to find the k-th element. However, it does not properly follow the sequence generation logic described in the problem. Specifically:
   - The sequence should be constructed iteratively by adding the middle element as the smallest unused positive integer and doubling the existing sequence. The program does not perform this construction.
   - Instead, it tries to manipulate the `steps` variable and searches for the index without actually constructing or understanding the sequence.

3. **Output**: The program outputs either `1` when the index is odd or the value of `steps` when the index is even. This does not correspond to the expected output of the element at the k-th position in the sequence, as it does not return the actual value in the sequence.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Even Indexes**: The logic used to determine the value at even indexes does not align with how the sequence is structured. When the index is even, the program does not correctly determine the integer that should be at that position based on the sequence construction rules.

5. **Mathematical Operations**: The use of `(right + left) / 2` needs to ensure integer division (using `//` in Python) to avoid potential issues with float values when working with indices.

In summary, the program does not construct the sequence as specified and does not correctly retrieve the value at the k-th position, which is required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
