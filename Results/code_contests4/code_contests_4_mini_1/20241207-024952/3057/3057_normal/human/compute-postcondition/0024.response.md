Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1. If `index` is less than (right + left) / 2, then `right` is adjusted to (right + 1) / 2 - 1. Otherwise, if `index` is greater than (right + left) / 2, `left` and `right` are adjusted to be equal and set based on (right + left) / 2 + 1.***
