The variable `index` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `steps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1, `steps` is 0, and `index` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1, `steps` is 0, `index` is 0**
