Output State: **`steps` is decremented to a value such that `steps` is equal to `0`; `index` is equal to `(right + left) / 2`, which means that the loop has successfully found the `index`; `left` and `right` values converge to the final value where `left` equals `right`, confirming the position of `index`.**
