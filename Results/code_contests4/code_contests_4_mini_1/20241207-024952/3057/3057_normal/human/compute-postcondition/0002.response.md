The code assigns the values obtained from `raw_input().split()` to the variables `steps` and `index`. The `raw_input()` function accepts input as a string, and `split()` divides that string into components based on whitespace. As such, `steps` and `index` will be assigned the values of the components from the input string. Since the initial values of `steps` and `index` are both integers, they will now be overwritten with string representations of the input values.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `steps` and `index` are now strings due to the assignment, while the original integer values are no longer accessible. The values depend on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now a string from input; `index` is now a string from input**
