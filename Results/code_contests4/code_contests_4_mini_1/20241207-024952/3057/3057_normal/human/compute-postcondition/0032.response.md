The code `print(steps)` outputs the current value of the variable `steps`. Since `steps` has been decremented to `0`, the output will reflect that value. The values of `index`, `left`, and `right` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is 0, `index` is equal to `(right + left) / 2`, `left` equals `right`.

Output State: **`steps` is 0, `index` is equal to `(right + left) / 2`, `left` equals `right`**
