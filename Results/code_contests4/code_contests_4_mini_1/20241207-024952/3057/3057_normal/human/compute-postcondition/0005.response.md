The variable `left` is assigned the value of 1. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `k`, `steps`, and `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now an integer; `index` is now an integer; `left` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now an integer; `index` is now an integer; `left` is 1**
