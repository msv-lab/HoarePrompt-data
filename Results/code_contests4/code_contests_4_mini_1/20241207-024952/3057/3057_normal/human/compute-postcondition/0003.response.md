`steps` is assigned the value of `int(steps)`, which converts the current string value of `steps` into an integer. The previous value of `steps` is a string, but it is not specified what that string is. Therefore, the output state reflects that `steps` has been converted to an integer, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now an integer; `index` is now a string from input.**
