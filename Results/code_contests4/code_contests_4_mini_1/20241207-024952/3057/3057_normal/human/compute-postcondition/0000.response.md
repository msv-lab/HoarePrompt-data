`steps` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n` and `k` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `steps` while maintaining the constraints on `n` and `k`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1, `steps` is 0**
