The variable `index` is converted from a string to an integer using `int(index)`. The initial state indicates that `index` is currently a string, and now it will hold an integer value. The values of `n`, `k`, and `steps` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now an integer; `index` is now an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now an integer; `index` is now an integer.**
