The code `print(1)` outputs the integer value 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now an integer; `index` is an integer and it is odd; `left` is 1; `right` is an integer such that `right` = 2^`steps` - 1; and the output value is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is now an integer; `index` is an integer and it is odd; `left` is 1; `right` is an integer such that `right` = 2^`steps` - 1; output value is 1.**
