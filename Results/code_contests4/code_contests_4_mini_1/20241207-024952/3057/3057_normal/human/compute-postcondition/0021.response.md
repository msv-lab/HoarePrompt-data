The value of `right` is recalculated based on the formula `(right + left) / 2 - 1`. The previous value of `left` is 1, and `right` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `(right + left) / 2 != index`. However, without knowing the initial value of `right`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `right`, but we can express the change.

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1; `right` is adjusted from its previous value to `(right + left) / 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1; `right` is adjusted to `(right + 1) / 2 - 1**.
