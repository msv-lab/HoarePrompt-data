Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^n - 1; `steps` is an integer; `index` is an integer; `left` is 1; `right` is an integer such that `right` = 2^`steps` - 1. If `index` is odd, the output value is 1. Otherwise, `steps` is 0, `index` is equal to `(right + left) / 2`, and `left` equals `right`.***
