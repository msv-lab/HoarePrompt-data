The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional context regarding the output or functionality based on these parameters, we cannot clearly describe what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept explicit parameters, but it operates under the constraints that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2^n - 1). The specific output of the function is not provided.**
