Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2^`n` - 1; `steps` is decremented by 1 and is not equal to `m + 1` for the even integer `index = 2^m`; `index` is an even integer; `left` is 1; `right` is an integer such that `right` = 2^`steps` - 1; `index` is greater than or equal to (right + left) / 2; if `index` is greater than (right + left) / 2, then `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of (right + left) / 2 + 1.***
