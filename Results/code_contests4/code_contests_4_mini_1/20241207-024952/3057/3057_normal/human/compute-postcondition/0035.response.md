Functionality: ** The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads two integers from input, `steps` and `index`, with constraints 1 ≤ `steps` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `index` ≤ 2^`steps` - 1. It checks if `index` is odd, in which case it prints 1. If `index` is even, it uses a binary search algorithm to determine the number of steps required to find the position of `index` within a range defined by `steps`. The function outputs either the value 1 or the number of steps needed to converge `left` and `right` to the value of `index`. The implementation appears to lack error handling for invalid inputs and assumes valid input is always provided.**
