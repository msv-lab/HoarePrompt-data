To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and see if it adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description.

The problem description states that we need to determine if it's possible to place a right triangle with legs of lengths `a` and `b` on a coordinate plane with integer coordinates such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The output should be "YES" or "NO" based on the possibility of such a positioning, followed by the integer coordinates of the triangle's vertices if the answer is "YES".

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` (the lengths of the triangle's legs). However, the program does not show how the input is read in the `func_1()` function, as `get_list()` is not defined within the provided code snippet.

2. **Pythagorean Triples**: The program generates Pythagorean triples (i, j, k) where `k` is the hypotenuse derived from the legs `i` and `j`. It checks if the input lengths `a` and `b` can be expressed as multiples of `k`. 

3. **Triangle Vertex Calculation**: If the conditions are satisfied, it attempts to print the coordinates of the triangle vertices. However, the actual coordinates printed could be incorrect based on how the triangle is supposed to be positioned.

4. **Output Logic**: The program prints "NO" if it doesn't find any suitable (i, j, k) that meets the criteria. However, it does not seem to take into account all possible configurations of the triangle for every pair of `a` and `b`.

### Potential Case for Incorrectness:
- For the input `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the program correctly identifies that a triangle cannot be formed according to the rules since all sides would be parallel to the axes (the triangle would be right on the origin). It outputs "NO", which is correct.

- However, for larger values, the logic is not comprehensive enough. For example, for `a = 2` and `b = 2`, the program needs to assess the ability to form a triangle that does not align with the axes. The program's logic might fail to generate valid coordinates or incorrectly state that a triangle cannot be formed when it can.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program lacks a complete implementation for input handling, potentially incorrect logic for determining valid triangle placements, and the lack of checks for all edge cases, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may fail to provide correct outputs for various inputs, especially when the triangle sides are equal or when the inputs are not coprime.
