If any condition leads to a return from the function, the function will terminate; otherwise, the function will complete without returning.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates all valid Pythagorean triples (i, j, k) where k is the integer hypotenuse for integer values of i and j ranging from 1 to 1000. It then checks if two integers a and b (obtained from the `get_list()` function) are divisible by k for each triplet. If they are, and if the condition `i * mul1 != mul2 * j` holds true, it calls the function `func_2` with specific parameters and terminates. If no such triplet satisfies the conditions, it calls `func_2` with 'NO'. The function does not have any explicit return value; thus, it may return None or nothing.

If `flush` is False, the state of `file`, `sep`, `at_start`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and is designed to print elements from a variable-length argument list (`args`) to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`). It also allows for an optional end character to be added at the end of the printed output and can flush the output stream if specified. However, since the function does not define or accept any actual arguments, it will fail to execute correctly as written. Additionally, it assumes the presence of `args` and `kwargs`, which are not defined in the provided code, leading to potential errors.
