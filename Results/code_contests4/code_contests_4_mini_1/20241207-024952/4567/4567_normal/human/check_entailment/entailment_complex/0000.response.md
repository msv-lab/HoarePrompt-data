To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations thoroughly.

### Problem Description Summary:
The goal is to determine if a right triangle with legs of lengths `a` and `b` can be placed on a plane such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and all vertices have integer coordinates.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It generates all valid Pythagorean triples `(i, j, k)` where `k` is the hypotenuse. 
   - It checks if `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`. If they are, it calculates multipliers `mul1` and `mul2` for `a` and `b`.
   - The condition `i * mul1 != mul2 * j` is checked to determine if the triangle can be positioned correctly.
   - If a valid triplet is found, it calls `func_2` to print "YES" and the coordinates of the triangle vertices.
   - If no valid configurations are found after checking all triplets, it calls `func_2` with "NO".

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to print the results but is incorrectly defined as it doesn't accept any parameters and uses `args` and `kwargs` without being defined.

### Important Edge Cases and Analysis:
- The triangle with legs of lengths `1` and `1` should return "NO" because it cannot be positioned off-axis and still have integer vertices.
- For larger values of `a` and `b`, the program checks combinations to find suitable integer coordinates.
  
### Key Issue:
The major problem with the implementation lies in `func_2`:
- `func_2` does not accept any arguments, yet it attempts to print variable-length arguments which are not defined. This will raise an error at runtime due to undefined `args` and `kwargs`.
- The annotations indicate that the function is supposed to print values, but since the function cannot execute correctly as defined, any case where it should print "YES" or "NO" will lead to an error instead.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the output due to the improper definition of `func_2`, leading to potential runtime errors. Therefore, despite the logic for evaluating whether the triangle can be placed correctly, the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, particularly in outputting results.

Correctness: **False**. The code fails to execute correctly in all cases due to a runtime error in the output function, thereby not fulfilling the problem description's requirements.
