You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a right triangle with legs of length a and b. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to locate the triangle on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. All the vertices must have integer coordinates. If there exists such a location, you have to output the appropriate coordinates of vertices.

Input

The first line contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000), separated by a single space.

Output

In the first line print either "YES" or "NO" (without the quotes) depending on whether the required location exists. If it does, print in the next three lines three pairs of integers — the coordinates of the triangle vertices, one pair per line. The coordinates must be integers, not exceeding 109 in their absolute value.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    trips = []
    for i in range(1, 1001):
        for j in range(1, 1001):
            k = (i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5
            if k.is_integer():
                k = int(k)
                trips.append([i, j, k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `trips` contains all valid combinations of `[i, j, k]` where `k` is the integer value of the hypotenuse calculated from `i` and `j` for all pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i, j ≤ 1000` and `k` is an integer.
    a, b = get_list()
    for (i, j, k) in trips:
        if a % k == 0 and b % k == 0:
            mul1 = a // k
            mul2 = b // k
            if i * mul1 != mul2 * j:
                func_2('YES')
                func_2(0, 0)
                func_2(j * mul1, i * mul1)
                func_2(-i * mul2, j * mul2)
                return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are values obtained from `get_list()`, `trips` may remain unchanged or be a list of trips, and if the loop executes, for each trip (i, j, k) where `a % k == 0` and `b % k == 0`, the state may change based on the conditions evaluated within the loop. If any condition leads to a return from the function, the function will terminate; otherwise, the function will complete without returning.
    func_2('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates all valid Pythagorean triples (i, j, k) where k is the integer hypotenuse for integer values of i and j ranging from 1 to 1000. It then checks if two integers a and b (obtained from the `get_list()` function) are divisible by k for each triplet. If they are, and if the condition `i * mul1 != mul2 * j` holds true, it calls the function `func_2` with specific parameters and terminates. If no such triplet satisfies the conditions, it calls `func_2` with 'NO'. The function does not have any explicit return value; thus, it may return None or nothing.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`; `file` is extracted from `kwargs`; `x` has been converted to a string for each element in `args` and written to `file`, separated by `sep` after the first element; `at_start` is False.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`; `file` is flushed, and `at_start` is False if `flush` is True. If `flush` is False, the state of `file`, `sep`, `at_start`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and is designed to print elements from a variable-length argument list (`args`) to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`). It also allows for an optional end character to be added at the end of the printed output and can flush the output stream if specified. However, since the function does not define or accept any actual arguments, it will fail to execute correctly as written. Additionally, it assumes the presence of `args` and `kwargs`, which are not defined in the provided code, leading to potential errors.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
