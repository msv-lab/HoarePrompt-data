According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1001. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Since the range of `j` is from 1 to 1001, it will still be valid for the loop to run.

State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is approximately 2.236, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1001.**
