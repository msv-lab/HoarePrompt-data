The code `trips.append([i, j, k])` appends a list containing the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to the `trips` list. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are all 2, so the list `[2, 2, 2]` will be added to `trips`. The other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `trips` now contains the new entry `[2, 2, 2]`.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `trips` now contains the new entry `[2, 2, 2]`**.
