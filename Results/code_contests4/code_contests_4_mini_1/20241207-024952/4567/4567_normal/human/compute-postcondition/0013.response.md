The value of `at_start` is set to `False`, but the states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`; `file` is extracted from `kwargs`; `x` is the next element in `args`; `at_start` is False**
