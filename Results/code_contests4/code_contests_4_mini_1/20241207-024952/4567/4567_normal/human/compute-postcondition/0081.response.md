The variable `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`, where `b` is obtained from `get_list()` and `k` is from the current tuple in `trips`. The previous value of `b` is not specified, but it is involved in the calculation of `mul2`. The output state will reflect the relationship between `b` and `k` without specifying their individual values.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are values obtained from `get_list()`; `mul1` is assigned the value `a // k`; `mul2` is assigned the value `b // k`.**
