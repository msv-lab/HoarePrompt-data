According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 4, and it must still be less than 1001. 

State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 4, and `k` is 4; for the loop to execute a fourth time, `j` must be less than 1001.**
