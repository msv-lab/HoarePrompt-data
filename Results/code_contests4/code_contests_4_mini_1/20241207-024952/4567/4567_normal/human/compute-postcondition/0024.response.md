The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The constraints indicate that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, but since they are not explicitly defined as parameters in the function signature, it implies that they may be used internally within the function. The output specifics are not provided, so we cannot determine the return value or any conditions for returning different outputs. Therefore, based on the information given, the functionality of the function `func_2` is not fully clear.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and the return value or functionality is not specified.**
