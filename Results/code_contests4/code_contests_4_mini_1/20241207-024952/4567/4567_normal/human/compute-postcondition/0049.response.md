According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to 1000, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1000. Since `j` is currently 4, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `j` equal to 5. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 5.

State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 5, and `k` is 5. For the loop to execute a fifth time, `j` must be less than or equal to 1000.**
