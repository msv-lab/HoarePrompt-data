The code appends the list `[i, j, k]` to the list `trips`. The current values of the variables are: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3. The values of `a` and `b` do not affect the operation, and the list `trips` is not defined in the initial state but will now contain the appended list. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `trips` now includes the list [2, 3, 3].

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `trips` now includes the list [2, 3, 3]**
