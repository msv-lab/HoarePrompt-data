Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`; `file` is extracted from `kwargs`; `x` is the next element in `args` after the current one; if `at_start` is False, then `file` has written the value of `sep`; `file` has written the string representation of `x`.**
