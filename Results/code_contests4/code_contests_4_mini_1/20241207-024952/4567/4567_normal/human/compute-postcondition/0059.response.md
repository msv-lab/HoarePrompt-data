The value of `mul1` is assigned the result of `a // k`, where `a` is divisible by `k`. Since both `a` and `k` are known, and `a` is divisible by `k`, this operation will yield an integer result without any remainder. The values of `b`, `trips`, and any other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned a value from `get_list()`, `b` is assigned a value from `get_list()`, `trips` is a list of at least one trip (i, j, k), `mul1` is equal to `a // k`.

Output State: **`a` is assigned a value from `get_list()`, `b` is assigned a value from `get_list()`, `trips` is a list of at least one trip (i, j, k), `mul1` is equal to `a // k**
