The line of code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` affects the state by writing a specific value to the `file`. The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` attempts to remove the key 'end' from `kwargs` and return its associated value. If 'end' does not exist in `kwargs`, it defaults to '\n'. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `sep`, and `at_start` are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the file has been modified by writing either the value associated with 'end' from `kwargs` or a newline character if 'end' was not present.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`; `file` has been modified to write the value of kwargs.pop('end', '\n'); `at_start` is False.**
