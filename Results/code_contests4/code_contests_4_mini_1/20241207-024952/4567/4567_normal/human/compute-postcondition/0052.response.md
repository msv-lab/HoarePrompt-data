The code appends the list `[i, j, k]` to the `trips` list. The current values of the variables are `i` which is 3, `j` which is 5, and `k` which is 5. The state of the other variables (`a`, `b`) is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `trips` list, which now contains the new entry.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `k` is 5, and `trips` now includes [3, 5, 5].**
