According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `trips` list. The loop will execute again for the next tuple of `(i, j, k)` in `trips`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, and `k` are the values from the last tuple of `trips`. 

To execute one more time, the next values of `i`, `j`, and `k` must be taken from the next tuple in the `trips` list. If the current tuple is the last one, the loop will not execute again. 

Assuming there is at least one more tuple in `trips` after the last iteration, we will refer to the next tuple as `(next_i, next_j, next_k)`. The values `a` and `b` will still be dependent on the `get_list()` function, and the divisibility conditions remain the same.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update to the next values in the `trips` list, and the states will reflect that.

State: **`a` and `b` are values obtained from `get_list()`, for the loop to execute a next time `(i, j, k)` will be `(next_i, next_j, next_k)` from the next tuple in `trips`**
