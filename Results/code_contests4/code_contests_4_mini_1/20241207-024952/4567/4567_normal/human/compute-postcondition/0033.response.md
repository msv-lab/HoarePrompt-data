`k` is assigned the value of `int(k)`, where `k` is approximately 3.605551275463989. The `int` function truncates the decimal part, so `k` becomes 3. The states of the other variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3**
