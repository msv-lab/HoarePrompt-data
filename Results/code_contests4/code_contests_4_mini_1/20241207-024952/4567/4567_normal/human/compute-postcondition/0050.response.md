The value of `k` is assigned the result of the expression `(i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5`. Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 5, we can calculate this as follows:

1. Calculate `i ** 2`:  
   \( 3 ** 2 = 9 \)

2. Calculate `j ** 2`:  
   \( 5 ** 2 = 25 \)

3. Sum the squares:  
   \( 9 + 25 = 34 \)

4. Take the square root:  
   \( (34) ** 0.5 \approx 5.831 \)

Therefore, `k` is calculated to be approximately 5.831. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the other variables `i` and `j` also retain their initial values. 

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `k` is approximately 5.831**.
