`k` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 2 respectively, so we calculate `k` as follows: 

\[
k = \sqrt{(2^2 + 2^2)} = \sqrt{(4 + 4)} = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828
\]

The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is approximately 2.828.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is approximately 2.828**
