The code `file.flush()` is called, which ensures that any buffered output in the `file` is written out immediately. The previous values of the variables are not changed by this action, and it primarily affects the `file` object. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`; `file` is flushed; `at_start` is False; and `flush` is True.**
