To analyze the given code snippet, we need to consider the initial state of the variables and how the code affects them.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is from `get_list()`
   - `b` is from `get_list()`
   - `trips` is a list of at least one trip (i, j, k)
   - `mul1` is `a // k`
   - `mul2` is `b // k`
   - It holds that `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`
   - `func_2` is called with the argument 'YES'
   - `func_2` is called with (0, 0)

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `func_2(j * mul1, i * mul1)` executes. Here, `mul1` is already defined as `a // k`, so:
     - The first argument becomes `j * (a // k)`
     - The second argument becomes `i * (a // k)`

3. **Impact**:
   - The variables `j` and `i` are multiplied by `mul1`, which is derived from `a` and `k`. This operation produces two new values:
     - The first argument of `func_2` is `j * (a // k)`
     - The second argument of `func_2` is `i * (a // k)`

4. **Final Output State**:
   - Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, `j`, `i`, or `k`, and we only know that `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`, we can summarize the output state based on the operations performed.

Output State: **`a` is from `get_list()`, `b` is from `get_list()`, `trips` is a list of at least one trip (i, j, k), `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`, `func_2` is called with (j * (a // k), i * (a // k))**
