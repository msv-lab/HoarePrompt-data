The value of `k` is assigned the value `int(k)`, where `k` is approximately 2.828. After applying the `int` function, `k` will be converted to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
