To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `a` is from `get_list()`
   - `b` is from `get_list()`
   - `trips` is a list of at least one trip `(i, j, k)`
   - `mul1` is `a // k`
   - `mul2` is `b // k`
   - `func_2` is called with `(j * (a // k), i * (a // k))`

2. The code snippet modifies the state by calling `func_2` with the arguments:
   - First argument: `-i * mul2`
   - Second argument: `j * mul2`

3. The variables affected by this operation are:
   - The output of `func_2` depends on the values of `i`, `j`, `mul2`, and in turn on `b` and `k`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified, we state the effects based on their forms. The values of `mul2` (which is `b // k`) will determine the computations involving `i` and `j`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `func_2` is called with the computed values based on the existing variables.

Output State: **`a` is from `get_list()`, `b` is from `get_list()`, `trips` is a list of at least one trip (i, j, k), `mul1` is `a // k`, `mul2` is `b // k`, `func_2` is called with (-i * mul2, j * mul2)**
