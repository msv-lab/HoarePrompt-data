`k` is assigned the value of the expression `(i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5`. Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 3, we can calculate `k` as follows: 

1. Calculate `i ** 2`: \(3^2 = 9\)
2. Calculate `j ** 2`: \(3^2 = 9\)
3. Sum these values: \(9 + 9 = 18\)
4. Take the square root: \(\sqrt{18} \approx 4.242640687119285\)

The states of the other variables, `a`, `b`, and `trips`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is approximately 4.242640687119285, `trips` contains all valid combinations of [2, j, k].
