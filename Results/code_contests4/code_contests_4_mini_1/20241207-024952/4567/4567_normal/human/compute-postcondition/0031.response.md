According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to iterate over a range from 1 to 1001 (exclusive of 1001). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3 for the next iteration. 

Since `k` and the values of `a` and `b` do not affect the execution of the loop in this context, they remain unchanged. 

State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `k` is an integer. For the loop to execute a third time, `j` must be less than 1001.**
