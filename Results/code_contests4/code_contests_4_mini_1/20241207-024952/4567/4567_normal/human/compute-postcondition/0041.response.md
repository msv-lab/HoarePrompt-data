The value of `k` is assigned the value `int(k)`, where `k` is approximately 4.242640687119285. The `int` function will convert `k` to an integer, resulting in `k` being 4. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `trips` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 4, and `trips` contains all valid combinations of [2, j, k].

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 4, `trips` contains all valid combinations of [2, j, k]**
