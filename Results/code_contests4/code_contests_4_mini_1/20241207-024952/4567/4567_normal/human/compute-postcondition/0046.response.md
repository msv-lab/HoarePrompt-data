The value of `k` is assigned the value `int(k)`. Since `k` is already an integer (5), its value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 5**
