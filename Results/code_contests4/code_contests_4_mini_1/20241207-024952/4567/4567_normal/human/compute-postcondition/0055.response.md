Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000; `trips` contains all valid combinations of `[i, j, k]` where `k` is the integer value of the hypotenuse calculated from `i` and `j` for all pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i, j ≤ 1000` and `k` is an integer.**
