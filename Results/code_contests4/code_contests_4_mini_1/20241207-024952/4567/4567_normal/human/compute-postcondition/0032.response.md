`k` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, the calculation is as follows: 

1. Calculate `i ** 2`: \( 2^2 = 4 \)
2. Calculate `j ** 2`: \( 3^2 = 9 \)
3. Sum the squares: \( 4 + 9 = 13 \)
4. Take the square root: \( \sqrt{13} \approx 3.605551275463989 \)

The values of `a`, `b`, and the loop condition for `j` do not affect the calculation of `k`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `k` is approximately 3.605551275463989.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is approximately 3.605551275463989**
