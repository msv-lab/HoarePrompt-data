The value of `k` is assigned the value of `int(k)`, where `k` is approximately 5.831. Converting this value to an integer results in `k` being 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `k` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `k` is 5**
