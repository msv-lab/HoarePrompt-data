The code appends a new list containing the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to the `trips` list. The current values are `i` is 3, `j` is 3, and `k` is 4. Therefore, the new list appended will be `[3, 3, 4]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 4, `trips` contains all valid combinations of [2, j, k] and now includes [3, 3, 4]**.
