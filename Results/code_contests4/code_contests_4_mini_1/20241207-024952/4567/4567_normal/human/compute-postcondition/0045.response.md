The value of `k` is assigned the result of the expression `(i ** 2 + j ** 2) ** 0.5`. Given that `i` is 3 and `j` is 4, we calculate `k` as follows:

1. Calculate \( i^2 \): \( 3^2 = 9 \)
2. Calculate \( j^2 \): \( 4^2 = 16 \)
3. Sum the squares: \( 9 + 16 = 25 \)
4. Take the square root: \( \sqrt{25} = 5 \)

Therefore, after execution, the value of `k` becomes 5 while the other variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is within [1, 1000], `b` is within [1, 1000], `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 5**
