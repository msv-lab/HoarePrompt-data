The code provided is a line of code that extracts the values of `sep` and `file` from a dictionary `kwargs`. Since this line does not change the values of `a` or `b`, and it only processes `kwargs`, no alterations occur to the integer variables `a` and `b`. Consequently, the state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`, defaulting to ' ', and `file` is extracted from `kwargs`, defaulting to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 1000; `sep` is extracted from `kwargs`, defaulting to ' ', and `file` is extracted from `kwargs`, defaulting to `sys.stdout`.**
