The variable `mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`, where `b` is a value from `get_list()` and `k` is from the next trip (i', j', k'). The previous values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but `mul1` is based on `a // k`. The output state reflects the new assignment of `mul2` while maintaining the existing values of `a`, `b`, and `mul1`. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from `get_list()`; `mul1` is the result of `a // k`; `mul2` is b // k**.
