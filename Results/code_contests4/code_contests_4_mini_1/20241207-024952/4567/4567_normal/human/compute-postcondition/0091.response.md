The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the execution of the function body, it has three distinct return cases: 

- Case_1: The function may return an unspecified value, indicating that the return statement does not specify a value or variable to return.
- Case_2: The function returns `None`, as there is no value specified to return in this case.
- Case_3: The function returns nothing, as the return statement is empty.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to not accept any parameters and to return either an unspecified value, `None`, or nothing based on the return statement used. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and may return an unspecified value, None, or nothing depending on the return statement.**
