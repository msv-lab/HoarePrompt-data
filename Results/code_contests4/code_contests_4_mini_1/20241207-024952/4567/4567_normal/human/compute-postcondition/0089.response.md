Output State: **`a` and `b` are values obtained from `get_list()`, `trips` may remain unchanged or be a list of trips, and if the loop executes, for each trip (i, j, k) where `a % k == 0` and `b % k == 0`, the state may change based on the conditions evaluated within the loop. If any condition leads to a return from the function, the function will terminate; otherwise, the function will complete without returning.**
