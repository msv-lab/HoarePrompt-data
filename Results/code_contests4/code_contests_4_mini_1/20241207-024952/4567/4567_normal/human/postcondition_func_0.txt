The function generates all valid Pythagorean triples (i, j, k) where k is the integer hypotenuse for integer values of i and j ranging from 1 to 1000. It then checks if two integers a and b (obtained from the `get_list()` function) are divisible by k for each triplet. If they are, and if the condition `i * mul1 != mul2 * j` holds true, it calls the function `func_2` with specific parameters and terminates. If no such triplet satisfies the conditions, it calls `func_2` with 'NO'. The function does not have any explicit return value; thus, it may return None or nothing.
