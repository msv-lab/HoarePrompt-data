Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. 

1. **Understanding of Triangle Placement**: The logic of determining whether the triangle can be placed such that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes seems flawed. The program attempts to create integer coordinates based on certain calculations with the lengths \(a\) and \(b\). However, it does not correctly ensure that the triangle formed by the points does not align with the axes.

2. **Example Failure**: For the input `1 1`, according to the problem description, the output should be "NO" because a right triangle with integer sides of lengths 1 cannot be positioned without having at least one side parallel to the axes. However, the code seems to not properly handle this case. 

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Checks**: The program assumes that it can always find integer coordinates based on the conditions provided. It does not comprehensively check all possible configurations or provide a guaranteed method for every valid input range.

4. **Incorrect Use of Variables**: The variables `mul1` and `mul2` are derived from the assumption that both lengths can be scaled by a common hypotenuse, which is not necessarily valid for all integers \(a\) and \(b\). There could be cases where the triangle cannot be formed, but the program does not adequately verify this.

Given these points, the program does not reliably implement the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
