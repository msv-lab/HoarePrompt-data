Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a string that is either "S", "H", "D", or "C"; `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards; `f` and `s` are input strings split from `coz`; `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to integers; it is not the case that `f[1]` is not equal to `coz` or `s[1]` is equal to `coz`. If `f[1]` is equal to `s[1]` and the value of `f[0]` is greater than `d[s[0]]`, then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `f[1]` is not equal to `s[1]` or the value of `f[0]` is less than or equal to `d[s[0]]`, then 'NO' is printed.***
