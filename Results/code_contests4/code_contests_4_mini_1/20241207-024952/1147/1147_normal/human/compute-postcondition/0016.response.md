The function `func` accepts three parameters: `trump_suit`, `card1`, and `card2`. The parameter `trump_suit` is a string that can be either "S", "H", "D", or "C". The parameters `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards, formatted as two characters where the first character is a rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", or "A") and the second character is a suit ("S", "H", "D", or "C"). 

The output of the function is not explicitly described, so we focus on the parameters and their constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter trump_suit (a string that is either "S", "H", "D", or "C") and two parameters card1 and card2 (strings representing cards formatted as two characters with a valid rank and suit).**
