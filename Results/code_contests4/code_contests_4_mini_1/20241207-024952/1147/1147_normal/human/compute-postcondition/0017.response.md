Functionality: ** The function reads a trump suit and two cards from input, then determines the outcome based on the following rules: If the suit of the first card matches the trump suit and the suit of the second card does not, it prints "YES". If the suit of the first card does not match the trump suit and the suit of the second card does, it prints "NO". If both cards have the same suit and the rank of the first card is higher than the rank of the second card, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not accept any parameters directly, as it uses raw input to fetch its values. **
