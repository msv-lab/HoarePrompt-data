Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a string that is either "S", "H", "D", or "C"; `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards; `f` and `s` are input strings split from `coz`; `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to integers. If the second element of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second element of `s` is not equal to `coz`, then "YES" is printed. Otherwise, if the second element of `f` is not equal to `coz` and the second element of `s` is equal to `coz`, "NO" is printed. If the second elements of `f` and `s` are equal and the value of `f[0]` is greater than `d[s[0]]`, then "YES" is printed. If the second elements of `f` and `s` are not equal or the value of `f[0]` is less than or equal to `d[s[0]]`, then "NO" is printed.***
