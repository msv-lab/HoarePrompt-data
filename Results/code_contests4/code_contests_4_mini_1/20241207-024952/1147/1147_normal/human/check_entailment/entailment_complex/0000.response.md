The provided program aims to determine whether the first card beats the second card based on the rules of the card game "Durak." Let's analyze the program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Inputs:**
   - A trump suit ("S", "H", "D", "C").
   - Two cards in the format of a rank followed by a suit (e.g., "QH", "9S").

2. **Rules for Beating:**
   - A card beats another if:
     - Both cards have the same suit, and the first card has a higher rank than the second.
     - The first card is a trump card, and the second is not.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program captures the trump suit and two cards correctly.

2. **Card Beating Logic:**
   - **Case 1:** If the suit of the first card matches the trump suit and the suit of the second card does not, it correctly outputs "YES."
   - **Case 2:** If the suit of the first card does not match the trump suit and the suit of the second card does, it correctly outputs "NO."
   - **Case 3:** If both cards have the same suit, it compares their ranks using a dictionary that correctly maps ranks to integers. It outputs "YES" if the rank of the first card is greater than the second; otherwise, it outputs "NO."

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the rules of the game as described:
- It handles trump cards appropriately.
- It compares ranks correctly when both cards have the same suit.

### Correctness:
The program follows the problem description and correctly determines the outcome for all potential inputs according to the specified rules.

Correctness: **True**
