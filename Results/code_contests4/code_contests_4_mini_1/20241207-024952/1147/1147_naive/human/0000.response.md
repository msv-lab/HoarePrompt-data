To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and identify potential issues.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - The trump suit (one of "S", "H", "D", "C").
   - Two cards in the format `<rank><suit>`, e.g., "QH" or "9S".

2. **Beating Conditions**:
   - A card beats another if:
     - Both cards have the same suit, and the first card has a higher rank.
     - The first card is a trump card and the second card is not, regardless of rank.

3. **Outputs**:
   - Print "YES" if the first card beats the second card, otherwise print "NO".

### Program Review
```python
coz = raw_input()
(f, s) = raw_input().split()
d = {'6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}
if f[1] == coz and s[1] != coz:
    print('YES')
elif f[1] != coz and s[1] == coz:
    print('NO')
elif f[1] == s[1] and [f[0]] > d[s[0]]:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Rank Comparison Logic**:
   - The line `elif f[1] == s[1] and [f[0]] > d[s[0]]:` has an error. It uses square brackets around `f[0]`, turning it into a list and making the comparison invalid. The correct comparison should be `d[f[0]] > d[s[0]]`.

2. **Output Logic**:
   - The conditions do not correctly cover all scenarios. For example, if both cards are of the same suit, and the first card is a trump, it should beat the second card regardless of their ranks.

### Potential Test Case
- **Example Input**:
   ```
   H
   AH 9H
   ```
   - Expected Output: "YES" (since "AH" is a higher card than "9H").
   - Actual Output (with the current logic): 
     - The first condition would not be satisfied, and the program would assess the second condition incorrectly due to the faulty comparison.

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle several cases correctly due to logical errors in the conditions and comparisons. 

Correctness: **False**.
