The variable `res` is assigned a very large integer value of `100000000000000000000000000`. The initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers within the range of 0 to 1000, but they are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `res` while the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ 1000; `res` is 100000000000000000000000000**
