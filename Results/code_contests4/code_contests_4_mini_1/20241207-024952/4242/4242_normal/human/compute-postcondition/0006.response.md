According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` which iterates through all possible permutations of the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has been updated to the minimum value calculated from the expression using `c` and `z`. Since `c` represents the current permutation of `a`, the loop can execute again if there are more permutations available.

If the loop has executed once, then `c` will have taken one of the permutations of `a`. The next permutation will be the next one in the sequence of permutations. The number of permutations of the list `a` is given by the factorial of the length of `a` (i.e., `len(a)!`). 

To execute one more time, `c` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence. Therefore, we need to know how many permutations have been executed so far to determine the next state of `c`.

State: **`res` is the minimum value calculated from the expression using the current permutation `c`, for the loop to execute one more time `a` must have more permutations left for `c`, and `c` will be the next permutation in the sequence.**
