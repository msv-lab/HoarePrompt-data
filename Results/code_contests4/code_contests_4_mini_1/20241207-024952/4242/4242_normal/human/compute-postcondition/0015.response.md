Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers (a, b, c, d) obtained through user input and evaluates all permutations of these integers with three operations (either '+' or '*') specified by additional user input. It computes the minimum result from these evaluations and prints it. The function does not explicitly handle invalid input or cases where the user does not provide exactly four integers or three operations.**
