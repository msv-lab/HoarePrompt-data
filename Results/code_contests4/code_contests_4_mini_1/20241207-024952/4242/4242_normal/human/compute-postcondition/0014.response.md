The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates on four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are subject to the constraint that 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000. The function performs three operations, which can either be addition ('+') or multiplication ('*').

Since the output specifics have not been provided, we can summarize that the function processes these integers through the specified operations. The exact nature of the return value would depend on the combination of operations applied.

Functionality: **The function operates on four integers a, b, c, and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000) and performs three operations which can be either addition or multiplication. The exact return value depends on the operations applied to these integers.**
