The value of `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes user input and splits it into a list of strings. The previous values of `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, while `res` is still 100000000000000000000000000. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment to `a` and the unchanged values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `b`, `c`, `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ 1000; `res` is 100000000000000000000000000**
