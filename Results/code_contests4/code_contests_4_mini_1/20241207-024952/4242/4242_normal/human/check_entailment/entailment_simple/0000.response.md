Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`), and it treats the input numbers as strings rather than integers. This is crucial because arithmetic operations need to be performed on integers.

2. **Operation Evaluation**: The program uses `eval()` to evaluate expressions constructed as strings. While this may work in simple cases, it is not safe or reliable, especially if the input is not properly sanitized. Moreover, it does not account for all possible ways to combine the numbers with the given operations.

3. **Permutation Logic**: The program only considers two specific arrangements of operations and does not account for all possible parenthetical groupings of operations. The order of operations can significantly affect the final outcome, particularly with the use of multiplication and addition (due to the non-commutative nature of operations). The correct strategy would involve systematically exploring all ways to combine the numbers with the given operations.

4. **Missing Combinations**: The logic only evaluates two specific configurations of the operations. The problem requires evaluating all possible ways to combine the four numbers using the sequence of three operations, which includes numerous nested combinations.

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description because it does not correctly handle input, does not evaluate all combinations of operations, and employs unsafe practices. Therefore, it cannot guarantee finding the minimal result as required.
