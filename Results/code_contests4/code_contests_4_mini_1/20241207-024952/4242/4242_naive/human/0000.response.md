To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its logic.

The problem requires finding the smallest number that can be obtained from four integers (a, b, c, d) using a specific sequence of three operations ('+' or '*'). The operations can be performed in any order, and the goal is to consider all possible orderings of these operations.

In the given program:

```python
res = 100000000000000000000000000
a = raw_input().split()
z = raw_input().split()
for c in itertools.permutations(a):
    res = min(res, eval('((' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[1] + c[2] + ')' + z[2] + c[3]))
    res = min(res, eval('(' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[2] + '(' + c[2] + z[1] + c[3] + ')'))
print(res)
```

### Issues with the Code:

1. **Limited Order Combinations**: The code only considers two specific orderings of operations:
   - `((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d`
   - `(a op1 b) op3 (c op2 d)`
   
   There are multiple other ways to combine four numbers with three operations which are not considered. For example, it does not consider:
   - `(a op1 (b op2 c)) op3 d`
   - `a op1 (b op2 (c op3 d))`
   - Other permutations of combining `c` and `d` in different ways with the operations.

2. **Use of `eval`**: Using `eval` can introduce security issues and is generally discouraged. However, this is not directly related to correctness but is worth mentioning as a bad practice.

### Example of Failure:

Consider the input:
```
1 2 3 4
* * +
```
The minimal result should be calculated considering all possible groupings of operations. The program does not evaluate all possibilities due to the limited combinations it checks, hence it may not find the minimal result for this input.

### Conclusion:

Since there are potential input cases where the program does not yield the correct minimal result due to the limited number of operation combinations it evaluates, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
