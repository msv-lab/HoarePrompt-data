The code `q.append([i, j])` adds the list `[i, j]` to the end of the list `q`. The values of `i` and `j` are known, with `j` being 1. The value of `i` is greater than or equal to 0 based on the initial state, but its exact value is not specified. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a list of strings, `q` now contains the coordinates of all replaced '#' characters plus the new coordinate [i, 1], `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the character at `grid[i][1]` is the next character to be processed.
