Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` may contain coordinates if valid cells were found and updated, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`, and `qq` contains the coordinates of all valid cells that were updated during the loop execution. If no valid updates were made, `grid` remains unchanged, `maxx` remains as it was, and `qq` contains only the coordinates of cells that were updated.**
