According to the code, the for loop executes over a list of coordinates calculated based on the current values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the list `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]` contains valid coordinates. 

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to define the values of `i` and `j`, which are given as the first elements of the first coordinate in `q`. Therefore, the state must include:

1. The condition that `q` contains at least one coordinate, which allows us to retrieve `i` and `j` from `q`.
2. The values of `i` and `j` as the first elements of the first coordinate in `q`.

Since `grid` is a list of strings where all '#' characters are replaced by 0, we don't need to adjust anything related to `grid` for the loop to execute. 

State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]` if `H` > 0, `maxx` is initialized to 0, `qq` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first element of the first coordinate in `q`, `j` is the second element of the first coordinate in `q`.**
