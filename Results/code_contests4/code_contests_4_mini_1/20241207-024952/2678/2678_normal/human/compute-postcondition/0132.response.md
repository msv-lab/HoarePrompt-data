The code appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The values of `grid[r][c]` and `maxx` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is 1, `maxx` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, and `qq` now includes the new element `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is 1, `maxx` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, and `qq` now includes the new element `[r, c]**
