Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all valid cells, `i` is a valid row index (0 <= i < H), `j` is a valid column index (0 <= j < W), and the coordinates `r` and `c` are such that 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and the cell at `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
