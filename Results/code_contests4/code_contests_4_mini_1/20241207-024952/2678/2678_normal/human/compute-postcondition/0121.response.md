The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value at `grid[r][c]`. Since `grid[r][c]` has been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, the new value of `maxx` will be either its previous value or `grid[i][j] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is now the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is now the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`**
