The value of `qq` is updated by appending the list `[r, c]` to it. The previous state of `qq` is unchanged except for this addition. The variables `grid`, `maxx`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `qq`.

Output State: **`grid` is updated at position `(r, c)` to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, `i` and `j` are unchanged; `qq` now contains the appended value `[r, c]`.**
