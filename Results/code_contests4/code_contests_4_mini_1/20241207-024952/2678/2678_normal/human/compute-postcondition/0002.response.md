`dist` is assigned a list of zeros with a length equal to `H`, which means the number of rows in `grid`. Other variables (`grid`, `W`, and `q`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a list of strings; `H` is the number of rows in `grid`; `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`; `q` is an empty list; `dist` is a list of zeros with a length of `H`.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings; `H` is the number of rows in `grid`; `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`; `q` is an empty list; `dist` is a list of zeros with a length of `H`.**
