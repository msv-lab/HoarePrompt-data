Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`, and `qq` contains all valid coordinates that were appended during the loop execution. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `v + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now contains the coordinate pair `[r, c]`. The variable `q` contains at least one more coordinate pair, with `i` and `j` being the next values from `q`.***
