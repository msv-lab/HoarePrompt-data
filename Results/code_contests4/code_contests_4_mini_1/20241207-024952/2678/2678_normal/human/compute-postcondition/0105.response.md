The value of `qq` is updated by appending the list `[r, c]` to it. The previous state of `qq` is not provided, but we know it will now contain the new coordinates `[r, c]`. The other variables `grid` and `maxx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now includes the new coordinates `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now includes the new coordinates `[r, c]`.**
