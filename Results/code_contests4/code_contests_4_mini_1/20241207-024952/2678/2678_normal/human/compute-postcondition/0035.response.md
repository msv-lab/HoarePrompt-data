According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `W`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the value that was used in the previous iteration, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 

If `j` is currently at its maximum value (`W - 1`), then the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than `W`.

State: **`grid` is a list of strings, `j` is the next column index which is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `W`.**
