The operation `q.append([i, j])` adds a new list containing the coordinates `[i, j]` to the list `q`. The initial state indicates that `grid` is a list of strings with specific conditions related to the character '#', and `j` is currently 1 where `grid[i][j]` is also '#'. The variable `q` will now include the new coordinate, but the values of `grid`, `H`, and `W` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the addition to `q` while maintaining the other variables' states.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters in row `i` replaced by 0; `q` now includes the coordinates `[i, j]`; `H` is greater than 0; `W` is greater than 1; `j` is 1; character at `grid[i][j]` is '#'**.
