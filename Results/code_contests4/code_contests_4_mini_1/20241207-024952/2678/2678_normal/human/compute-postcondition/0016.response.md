According to the code, the loop iterates over the width of the grid, which is determined by the variable `W`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, indicating that this is the first iteration of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Since `W` remains greater than 0, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `W`.

State: **`grid` is a list of strings, for the loop to execute a second time `W` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1.**
