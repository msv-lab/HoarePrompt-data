Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are within the bounds of the grid and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` contains the appended value `[r, c]`.***
