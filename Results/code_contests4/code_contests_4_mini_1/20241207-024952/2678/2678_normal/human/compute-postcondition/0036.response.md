`q` is updated by appending the list `[i, j]`, where `i` is the current row index and `j` is the next column index. The other variables and their values remain unchanged as this operation only affects the list `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a list of strings, `j` is the next column index, and `q` has a new entry `[i, j]` added to it.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings, `j` is the next column index, `q` has a new entry `[i, j]` added to it.**
