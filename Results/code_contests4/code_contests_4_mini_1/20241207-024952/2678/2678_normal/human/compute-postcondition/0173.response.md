According to the code, the `while` loop can execute as long as `q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is equal to `qq`, which contains all valid coordinates that were appended during the loop execution. For the loop to be executed one more time, `q` must contain at least one valid coordinate. Therefore, the state of `q` must be adjusted to ensure that it is not empty. 

Since we are not provided with explicit information about whether `qq` is empty or not at the moment, we can conclude that to ensure `q` has at least one valid coordinate, `qq` must also contain at least one valid coordinate at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.'; `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`; `qq` contains all valid coordinates that were appended during the loop execution; for the loop to execute again, `q` must contain at least one valid coordinate**.
