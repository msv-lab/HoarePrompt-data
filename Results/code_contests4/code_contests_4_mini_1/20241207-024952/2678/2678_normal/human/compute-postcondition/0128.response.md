Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If the coordinate `[r, c]` is valid (i.e., within the bounds of the grid) and corresponds to a `'.'`, then `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, while `qq` now contains the newly appended value `[r, c]`. If the coordinate is invalid or does not correspond to `'.'`, no changes are made to `maxx` or `qq`.***
