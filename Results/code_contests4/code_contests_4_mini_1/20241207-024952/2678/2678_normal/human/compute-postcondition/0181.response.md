Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.', `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`, and `qq` contains the coordinate `[r, c]` if `grid[r][c]` has been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`. The value of `maxx` may be updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`. The coordinates `i` and `j` retain their values from `q`, and `r` and `c` are within valid ranges, while `q` still contains at least one valid coordinate.***
