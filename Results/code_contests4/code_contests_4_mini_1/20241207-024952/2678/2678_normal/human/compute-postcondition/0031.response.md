According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `W`. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `W` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute at least once more. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and it needs to be less than `W`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1, and the character at `grid[i][1]` will be accessed during this iteration.

State: **`grid` is a list of strings, `q` contains the coordinates of all replaced '#' characters plus the new coordinate [i, 0], `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the character at `grid[i][1]` is the next character to be processed.**
