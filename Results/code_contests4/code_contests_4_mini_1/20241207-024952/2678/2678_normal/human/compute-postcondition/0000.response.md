The values of `H` and `W` are assigned based on the dimensions of the `grid`. `H` is assigned the value of the number of rows in the grid, which is `len(grid)`, and `W` is assigned the value of the number of columns in the first row of the grid, which is `len(grid[0])`. The values of `H` and `W` will depend on the specific dimensions of the `grid`, but they will both be at least 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a list of strings; `H` is the number of rows in `grid`; `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings; `H` is the number of rows in `grid`; `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`**
