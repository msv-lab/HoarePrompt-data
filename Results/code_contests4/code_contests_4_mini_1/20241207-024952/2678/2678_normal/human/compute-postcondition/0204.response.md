Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.'; if the coordinates `(r, c)` are within the bounds of the grid and the cell `grid[r][c]` contains '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and the coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to the list `qq`. If the coordinates are out of bounds or the cell does not contain '.', no changes occur to `maxx` or `qq`.***
