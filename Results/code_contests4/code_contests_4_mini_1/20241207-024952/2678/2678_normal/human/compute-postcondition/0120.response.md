The value of `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`. Since `grid[i][j]` is an integer value (0 or greater), `grid[r][c]` will now hold the value that is one more than the value at `grid[i][j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated at position `[r][c]` to `grid[i][j] + 1`, where `grid[i][j]` is an integer, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`grid` is updated at position `[r][c]` to `grid[i][j] + 1`, where `grid[i][j]` is an integer, and other variables remain unchanged.**
