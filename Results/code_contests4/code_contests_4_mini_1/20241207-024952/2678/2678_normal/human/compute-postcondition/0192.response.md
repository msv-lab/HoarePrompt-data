Initial State: `grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.', `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`, `qq` is now an empty list, for the loop to execute `q` must contain at least one valid coordinate, and `i` and `j` will be the first coordinate from `q`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, if the loop executes at least once, `grid` will be a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, and the cells that were '.' will have been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1` for each valid coordinate `[r, c]`. The value of `maxx` will be the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`, reflecting any changes made during the loop. The list `qq` will contain all the coordinates `[r, c]` that were updated during the loop execution. The coordinates `i` and `j` retain their values from `q`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `q` is empty or no valid coordinates are found), then `grid` will remain unchanged, `maxx` will remain as it was initially, and `qq` will remain an empty list.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.', `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`, `qq` contains all coordinates `[r, c]` that were updated during the loop execution.**
