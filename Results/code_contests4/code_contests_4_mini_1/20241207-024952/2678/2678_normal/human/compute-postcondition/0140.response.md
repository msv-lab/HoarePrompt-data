The code appends the coordinate pair `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous values of `r` and `c` are still valid within the specified ranges, and `qq` will now contain one additional coordinate. The states of the other variables (`grid`, `maxx`, `q`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is updated to the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, which is `v + 1`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now contains one additional coordinate pair `[r, c]`; `q` contains at least one more coordinate pair; `i` and `j` are the next values from `q`; `r` is within the range 0 to H-1; `c` is within the range 0 to W-1.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, which is `v + 1`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now contains one additional coordinate pair `[r, c]`; `q` contains at least one more coordinate pair; `i` and `j` are the next values from `q`; `r` is within the range 0 to H-1; `c` is within the range 0 to W-1.**
