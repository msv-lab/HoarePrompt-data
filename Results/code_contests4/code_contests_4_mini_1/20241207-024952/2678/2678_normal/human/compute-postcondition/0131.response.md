`maxx` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. Since `grid[r][c]` is 1, the new value of `maxx` will depend on its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is 1, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is 1, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1.**
