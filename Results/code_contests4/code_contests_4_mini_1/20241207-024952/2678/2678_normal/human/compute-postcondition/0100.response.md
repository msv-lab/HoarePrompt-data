The code snippet `qq.append([r, c])` appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The values of `r` and `c` are not specified in the initial state but are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program. The previous state of `qq` is not provided, but we can say it is updated to include the new pair `[r, c]`. The other variables like `maxx` and `grid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to max(`maxx_prev`, `grid[i][j]_prev + 1`), `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j]_prev + 1`, and `qq` is updated to include the pair `[r, c]`.**
