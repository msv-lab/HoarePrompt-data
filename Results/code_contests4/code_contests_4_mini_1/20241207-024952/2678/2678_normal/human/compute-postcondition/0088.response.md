Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`, and `qq` contains the coordinates of all valid cells. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and the coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to `qq`. If any of the conditions fail, `grid[r][c]` remains unchanged and `maxx` and `qq` are unaffected.***
