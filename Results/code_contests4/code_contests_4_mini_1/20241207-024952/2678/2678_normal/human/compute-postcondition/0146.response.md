Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0; if the coordinates `(r, c)` are within the bounds of the grid and the cell `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to either the previous maximum value or `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the valid coordinates `qq` now include the new coordinate `[r, c]`.***
