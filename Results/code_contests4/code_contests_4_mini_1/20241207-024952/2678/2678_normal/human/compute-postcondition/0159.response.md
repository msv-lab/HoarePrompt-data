Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are valid and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `q` remains empty while `qq` contains the coordinates `[r, c]`.***
