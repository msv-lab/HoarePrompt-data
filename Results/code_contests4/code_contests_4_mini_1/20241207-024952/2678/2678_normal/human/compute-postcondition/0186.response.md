Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If the coordinates `[r, c]` are within the bounds of the grid and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`, and `qq` now contains the new coordinate `[r, c]`.***
