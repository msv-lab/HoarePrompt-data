Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If the coordinates (r, c) are within the bounds of the grid and the cell at `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the coordinates [r, c] are added to `qq`. If (r, c) is out of bounds or not a valid cell, no changes are made.***
