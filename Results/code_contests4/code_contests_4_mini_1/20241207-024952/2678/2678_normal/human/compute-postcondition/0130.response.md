The variable `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. Since `grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, it implies that `grid[i][j]` is 0. Therefore, `grid[r][c]` will be updated to 0 + 1, which is 1. The other values in `grid` are unaffected. 

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is 1, and other values in `grid` remain unchanged.**
