The variable `maxx` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. The value of `grid[r][c]` has been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`. Therefore, the output state depends on the previous values of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`.

If we denote the previous value of `maxx` as `maxx_prev` and the previous value of `grid[i][j]` as `grid[i][j]_prev`, then:
- `grid[r][c]` is now `grid[i][j]_prev + 1`.
- The new value of `maxx` becomes `max(maxx_prev, grid[i][j]_prev + 1)`.

Since we don't have specific values for `maxx_prev` or `grid[i][j]_prev`, we can only state their relationships.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to max(`maxx_prev`, `grid[i][j]_prev + 1`) and `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j]_prev + 1`.**
