The code `qq.append([r, c])` adds the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The values of `grid[r][c]` and `maxx` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and notes that the coordinates `[r, c]` have been appended to `qq`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`.**
