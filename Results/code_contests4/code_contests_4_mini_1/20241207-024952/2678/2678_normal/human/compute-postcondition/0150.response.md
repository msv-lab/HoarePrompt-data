`qq` is a list that is being appended with the coordinates `[r, c]`. The previous state of `grid` remains unchanged, and `maxx` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `grid[r][c]`; `qq` now includes the coordinates `[r, c]`.**
