Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `maxx_prev` and `grid[i][j]_prev + 1`, `grid[r][c]` is set to `grid[i][j]_prev + 1`, and `qq` is updated to include the pair `[r, c]`.***
