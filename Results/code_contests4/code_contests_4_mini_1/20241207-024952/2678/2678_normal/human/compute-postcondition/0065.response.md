Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]` if `H` > 0, `maxx` is initialized to 0, and `qq` is an empty list. If the coordinates (r, c) are valid (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W) and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c] + 1`, and the coordinates [r, c] are added to `qq`. If the coordinates (r, c) are not valid or `grid[r][c]` is not '.', then no changes are made to `maxx` or `qq`.***
