The code `qq.append([r, c])` appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous state of `maxx` is not affected by this operation, and no values of `r` or `c` are provided, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, we can state that the operation modifies the `qq` list by adding a new element to it.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to max(`maxx`, `grid[i][j] + 1`); `qq` now includes the new element [r, c].**
