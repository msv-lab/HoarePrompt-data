According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the height `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `H` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `H` must be greater than 1.

State: **`grid` is a list of strings, `H` is greater than 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list where `dist[0]` is now an empty list, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `H` must be greater than 1**
