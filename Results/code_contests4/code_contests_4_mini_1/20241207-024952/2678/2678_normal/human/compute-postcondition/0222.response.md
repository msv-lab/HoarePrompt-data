Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are within bounds and correspond to a cell that is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and the coordinates `[r, c]` are added to `qq`. If the conditions are not met, no changes are made to `grid`, `maxx`, or `qq`.***
