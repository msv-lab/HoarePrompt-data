Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.'; if the coordinates `(r, c)` are valid (within bounds and pointing to an updated cell), then `maxx` is updated to the maximum between its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the coordinates `(r, c)` are added to `qq`.***
