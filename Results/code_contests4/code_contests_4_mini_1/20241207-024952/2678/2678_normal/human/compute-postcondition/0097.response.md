Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one more coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`, `qq` contains the coordinates of at least one additional valid cell to be processed, `i` and `j` are defined and within the bounds of the grid dimensions (0 to H-1 for rows and 0 to W-1 for columns). Additionally, `r` is within the range of 0 to H-1, `c` is within the range of 0 to W-1, and the cell `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
