Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are valid and correspond to an empty cell in `grid`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `grid[r][c]`, and the coordinates `[r, c]` are added to `qq`. If `(r, c)` is not valid or does not correspond to an empty cell, no changes are made to `maxx` or `qq`.***
