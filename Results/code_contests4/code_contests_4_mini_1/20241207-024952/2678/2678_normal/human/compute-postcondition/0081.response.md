The value of `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the new value at `grid[r][c]`. Since `grid[r][c]` was updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, the new value of `grid[r][c]` is now being considered in the calculation of `maxx`. The previous value of `maxx` is not specified, so it can be any value. However, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`.**
