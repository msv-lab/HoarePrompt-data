Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If the coordinates `r` and `c` are within the bounds of the grid and `grid[r][c]` is a '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and the coordinate `[r, c]` is added to `qq`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
