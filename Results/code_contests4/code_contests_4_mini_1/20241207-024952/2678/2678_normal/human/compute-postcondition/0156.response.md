The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. Since `grid[i][j]` is a valid cell in the grid, we can assume it has a numerical value. The new value at `grid[r][c]` will therefore be one greater than that of `grid[i][j]`. The maximum value `maxx` in the updated cells of `grid` may need to be recalculated if the new value at `grid[r][c]` exceeds the current `maxx`. The values of `q`, `i`, `j`, and the contents of other cells in `grid` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`grid` is updated at position (r, c) to be `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` may be updated if `grid[r][c]` exceeds the previous maximum. `q` is empty, (i, j) are valid coordinates within the bounds of the grid, and the cell at `grid[r][c]` was previously '.'**
