Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and the coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to `qq`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
