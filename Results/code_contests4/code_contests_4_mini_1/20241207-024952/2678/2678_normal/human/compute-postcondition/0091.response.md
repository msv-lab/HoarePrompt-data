The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and the updated value of `grid[r][c]`. Since `grid[r][c]` has been updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, the new value of `grid[r][c]` is now a valid integer. The exact value of `maxx` prior to this operation is unknown, but it will now be the greater of its previous value or `grid[i][j] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxx` is updated to max(`maxx`, `grid[i][j] + 1`)**
