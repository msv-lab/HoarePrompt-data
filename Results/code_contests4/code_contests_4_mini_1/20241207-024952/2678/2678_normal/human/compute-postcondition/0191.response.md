Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`, and `qq` contains the coordinate `[i + 1, j]`. If `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `grid` is updated with `grid[r][c]` as `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; `qq` is updated to include the coordinate `[r, c]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
