The value of `maxx` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value at `grid[r][c]`. The previous state indicates that `grid[r][c]` was updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, which means it now holds a value greater than or equal to its previous value. Since `maxx` may change if `grid[r][c]` exceeds its previous value, we would need to consider both cases. The output state reflects the condition of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`grid` is updated at coordinates `(r, c)` with the value `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`**
