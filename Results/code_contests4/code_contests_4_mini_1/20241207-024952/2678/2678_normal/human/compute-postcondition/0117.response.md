According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. The loop executes for each coordinate pair `(i, j)` in `q`. Since `qq` is an empty list, `q` will also be empty, which means that the loop will not execute at all. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, `q` must contain at least one coordinate pair. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `q` should be a list with at least one coordinate, and `i` and `j` should be initialized to the first coordinate in `q`.

State: **`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate pair, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`, `qq` is not empty, `i` is the first element of the first coordinate in `q`, `j` is the second element of the first coordinate in `q`.**
