Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]` if `H` > 0, and `maxx` is at least 1. If the coordinates (r, c) are within the bounds of the grid and the corresponding cell in `grid` is '.', then `qq` contains the list [r, c]. Otherwise, `qq` remains unchanged.***
