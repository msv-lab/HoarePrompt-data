Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]` if `H` > 0, and `maxx` is at least 1. If the coordinates (r, c) are valid (i.e., within the bounds of `grid` and `grid[r][c]` is '.'), then `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and the coordinate `[r, c]` is added to `qq`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `grid`, `maxx`, or `qq`.***
