The value of `qq` is appended with the list containing the values `[r, c]`. The previous values of `r` and `c` are not specified, but they remain unchanged by this action. The states of `grid`, `maxx`, and the rest of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is now the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now includes `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is now the maximum of its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now includes `[r, c]`.**
