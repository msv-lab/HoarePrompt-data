`qq` is updated to append the list `[r, c]`, which signifies that the coordinates `(r, c)` are now added to the queue `qq`. The values of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, which is `grid[i][j] + 1`; `grid[r][c]` is now `grid[i][j] + 1` and was previously '.'; `q` remains empty; `qq` now contains the coordinates `[r, c]`.
