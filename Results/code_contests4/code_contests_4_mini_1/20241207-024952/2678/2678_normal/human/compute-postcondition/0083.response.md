Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains at least one coordinate, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in the updated cells of `grid`, `qq` contains the coordinates of all valid cells, and if the conditions `0 <= r < H` and `0 <= c < W` are satisfied and `grid[r][c]` is '.' then `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` contains an additional element `[r, c]`. If the conditions are not satisfied, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
