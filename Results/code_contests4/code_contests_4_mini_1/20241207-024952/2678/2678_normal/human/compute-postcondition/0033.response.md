The character at `grid[i][j]` (where `j` is 1) is assigned the value `0`. The specific value of `grid[i][1]` before the assignment is not provided, but it will be replaced by `0`. The other variables `q`, `H`, `W`, `i`, and any other elements in `grid` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a list of strings with `grid[i][1]` now set to `0`, `q` contains the coordinates of all replaced '#' characters plus the new coordinate [i, 1], `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`grid` is a list of strings with `grid[i][1]` now set to `0`, `q` contains the coordinates of all replaced '#' characters plus the new coordinate [i, 1], `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1.**
