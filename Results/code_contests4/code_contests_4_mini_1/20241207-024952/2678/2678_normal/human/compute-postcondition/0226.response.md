The operation `qq.append([r, c])` adds the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous values of `maxx` and `grid[r][c]` are not affected by this operation, and the state of `qq` will change by appending a new element.

Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, where `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`; `qq` now includes the pair `[r, c]`**.
