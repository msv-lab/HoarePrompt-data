The code appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The values of `grid[r][c]` and `maxx` remain unchanged, as the operation only affects the list `qq`. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; and `qq` now contains an additional element `[r, c]`.

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `grid[r][c]`; and `qq` now contains an additional element `[r, c]`.**
