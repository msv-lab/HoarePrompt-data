Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.', `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`. If the coordinates `(r, c)` are within bounds and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` may be updated based on the maximum of the previous `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `(r, c)` is added to `qq`. If the conditions for `(r, c)` are not met, the state remains unchanged.***
