Postcondition: ***`grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.', if the coordinates `[r, c]` are within the grid boundaries and `grid[r][c]` is '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum between its previous value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` now includes the pair [r, c].***
