The code appends the coordinates `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous values of `grid[r][c]` and `maxx` do not change with this operation. Thus, the state of the variables is updated only by adding the new element to the list `qq`. 

Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`, and `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`.**
