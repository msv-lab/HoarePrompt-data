Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for determining the number of operations needed to turn all white squares black. Instead, the program computes the maximum distance from any black square to the nearest white square, which is not the same as counting the number of operations needed.

Here are the key points that illustrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Counting Operations**: The problem description specifies that we need to count the number of operations performed until all white squares become black. However, the program returns the maximum distance from any black square to the nearest white square instead of counting the rounds of spread of the black color.

2. **Grid Update Logic**: The logic to update the grid is flawed for the intended purpose. The program modifies the grid to contain integers that represent distances rather than simply performing operations to turn white squares black. Each operation corresponds to a round of spreading, but the program does not track the number of such rounds.

3. **Final Output**: The output of the program (`maxx`) does not represent the number of operations as required. Instead, it gives the furthest distance a white square is from a black square, which is unrelated to how many times the spreading operation actually occurs.

For example, in a grid where the black squares are surrounded by white squares, the program will output the maximum distance rather than the number of iterations it takes for all surrounding white squares to turn black.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the specifications of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
