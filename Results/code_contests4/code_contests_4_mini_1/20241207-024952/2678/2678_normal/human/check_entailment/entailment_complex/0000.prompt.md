You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns, where each square is painted white or black. HW characters from A_{11} to A_{HW} represent the colors of the squares. A_{ij} is `#` if the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is black, and A_{ij} is `.` if that square is white.

We will repeatedly perform the following operation until all the squares are black:

* Every white square that shares a side with a black square, becomes black.



Find the number of operations that will be performed. The initial grid has at least one black square.

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 1000
* A_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* The given grid has at least one black square.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
A_{11}A_{12}...A_{1W}
:
A_{H1}A_{H2}...A_{HW}


Output

Print the number of operations that will be performed.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: grid is a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid containing characters '#' (black square) and '.' (white square). The grid has at least one black square, and the dimensions of the grid are such that 1 <= len(grid) <= 1000 and 1 <= len(grid[0]) <= 1000.
def func_1(grid):
    H, W = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    q = []
    dist = [0] * H
    for i in range(H):
        dist[i] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `grid` is a list of strings, `H` is a non-negative integer, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]` if `H` > 0, `q` is an empty list, `dist` is a list where each element `dist[i]` is an empty list for `i` in range `H`.
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if grid[i][j] == '#':
                q.append([i, j])
                grid[i][j] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0, `q` contains the coordinates of all replaced '#' characters in the form of lists `[i, j]` for all rows, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]` if `H` > 0.
    maxx = 0
    while q:
        qq = []
        
        for i, j in q:
            for r, c in [[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]:
                if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.':
                    grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1
                    maxx = max(maxx, grid[r][c])
                    qq.append([r, c])
        
        q = qq
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `grid` is a list of strings with all '#' characters replaced by 0 and updated values in cells that were '.'; `q` is empty, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is the number of columns in `grid[0]`, `maxx` is the maximum value found in all updated cells of `grid`.
    return maxx
    #The program returns the maximum value found in all updated cells of the grid
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings representing a grid of characters, where '#' represents a black square and '.' represents a white square. It replaces all '#' characters with 0 and updates the '.' characters to reflect the distance from the nearest '#' character, returning the maximum distance found in the updated cells. If there are no '.' characters adjacent to a '#', those cells remain unchanged. The function assumes that at least one '#' character is present in the grid.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
