The function accepts a list of strings representing a grid of characters, where '#' represents a black square and '.' represents a white square. It replaces all '#' characters with 0 and updates the '.' characters to reflect the distance from the nearest '#' character, returning the maximum distance found in the updated cells. If there are no '.' characters adjacent to a '#', those cells remain unchanged. The function assumes that at least one '#' character is present in the grid.
