To determine the correctness of the provided Python program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the code and any potential edge cases that might not be handled.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program needs to compute the number of operations required to turn all white squares (represented by `.`) into black squares (represented by `#`). A white square turns black if it shares a side with a black square. The process continues until all squares are black.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the grid (H, W) and the grid itself.
2. **Initialization**: 
   - It initializes a queue `q` to keep track of black squares' coordinates.
   - It also initializes a 2D list `dist` to track the distance (or the number of operations) from the nearest black square to each white square.
3. **Propagation Logic**:
   - The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to propagate the black color to adjacent white squares.
   - For each black square in the queue, it checks its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If a neighbor is a white square, it turns it black and increments its distance based on the current black square's distance.
   - The maximum distance found during this process is returned, representing the number of operations required.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Single Black Square**: If the grid contains only one black square surrounded by white squares, the program should correctly count the operations until all white squares turn black.
2. **All Black Squares**: If the grid is entirely black from the start, the output should be `0` operations.
3. **Isolated White Squares**: If there are white squares that are completely surrounded by black squares, the program should ensure it counts the correct number of operations until these squares turn black.

### Potential Issue Found:
The code uses `grid[i][j] = 0` to mark the initial black squares, which is correct, but later it uses `grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1`. This could lead to an issue because `grid[i][j]` has been set to `0`, and using it as a reference for the distance calculation may lead to incorrect propagation if the distances are not handled properly.

Additionally, the program does not handle situations where black squares might already be adjacent to other black squares in the next iteration, and thus may not accurately capture the propagation of black squares in a multi-step process.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues with distance calculations and propagation logic, it appears that the program may not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure:
Consider a grid like this:
```
1 3
.#.
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program might return a different value due to the propagation logic not being correctly implemented.
