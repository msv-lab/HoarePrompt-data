Correctness: **False**. 

The provided program does not implement any logic that relates to the problem description, which is about counting "excellent" numbers of a specific length that consist only of two given digits. Instead, the program simply reads a string of numbers, splits them, and converts them into a list of integers. 

For example, for the input `1 3 3`, the program does not calculate the number of excellent numbers of length 3 consisting only of the digits 1 and 3, which is what is required. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem requirements entirely.
