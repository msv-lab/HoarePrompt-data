You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vitaly is a very weird man. He's got two favorite digits a and b. Vitaly calls a positive integer good, if the decimal representation of this integer only contains digits a and b. Vitaly calls a good number excellent, if the sum of its digits is a good number.

For example, let's say that Vitaly's favourite digits are 1 and 3, then number 12 isn't good and numbers 13 or 311 are. Also, number 111 is excellent and number 11 isn't. 

Now Vitaly is wondering, how many excellent numbers of length exactly n are there. As this number can be rather large, he asks you to count the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (109 + 7).

A number's length is the number of digits in its decimal representation without leading zeroes.

Input

The first line contains three integers: a, b, n (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 9, 1 ≤ n ≤ 106).

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 9, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    s = (
    '67 9 43 36 6 50 60 58 4 55 19 47 53 10 80 62 17 54 59 22 78 33 64 65 28 79 75 21 77 48 56 49 24 3 70 5 1 66 27 82 11 45 20 23 42 37 40 63 7 85 76 2 52 13 83 71 38 84 32 72 25 31 61 8 41 16 29 34 57 73 12 44 35 26 69 68 18 51 81 39 46 30 14 74 15'
    )
    a = list(map(int, s.split()))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and initializes a list `a` with a predefined set of integers. However, it does not utilize the parameters `a`, `b`, and `n` described in the annotations, nor does it return any result or perform any operations based on them. The function only creates and stores a list of integers from a string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
