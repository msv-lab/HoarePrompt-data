Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Parameter Utilization**: The function `func()` does not take any parameters, nor does it use the parameters `a`, `b`, and `n` which are crucial for the problem. According to the problem description, the function must work with these parameters to determine how many excellent numbers of a specific length contain only the digits `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The problem requires a calculation based on the digits `a` and `b`, and the length `n`. The program should compute the count of excellent numbers of length `n` that consist only of the digits `a` and `b`. Instead, the function merely initializes a list of integers from a predefined string without performing any calculations or returning any results.

3. **No Output**: There is no output mechanism in the function to return the required count of excellent numbers. The problem explicitly states that the output should be a single integer, which is not addressed in the code.

In summary, the program does not implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described, thus it is incorrect. The lack of parameter usage, absence of necessary calculations, and missing output all contribute to its failure to meet the requirements.
