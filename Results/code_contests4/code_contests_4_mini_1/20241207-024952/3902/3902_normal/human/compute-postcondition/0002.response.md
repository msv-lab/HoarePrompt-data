The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition; however, it operates under the constraints that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 9, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. After executing the function body, it produces a result based on the specified constraints. The exact output is not provided, but it can be inferred that the function will return a value based on some form of operation or calculation involving `a`, `b`, and `n`.

Functionality: **The function operates with parameters a and b (where 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 9) and n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a result based on these constraints.**
