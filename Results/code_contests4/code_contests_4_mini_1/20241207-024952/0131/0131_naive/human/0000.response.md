Correctness: **False**.

The provided program simply prints the number 5, which does not implement any logic to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array. This is a significant deviation from the problem description, which requires a calculation based on the input array and the value of k.

For example, consider the first input case:

Input:
```
6 5
1 2 2 4 2 3
```
According to the problem, the required output is 3 moves to make at least 5 elements equal. However, the program does not perform any calculations and incorrectly outputs 5 regardless of the input.

This clearly indicates that the program does not meet the requirements defined in the problem description for any input case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
