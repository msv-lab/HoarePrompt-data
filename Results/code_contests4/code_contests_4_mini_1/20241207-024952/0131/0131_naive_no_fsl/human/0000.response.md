Correctness: **False**

The provided program simply prints the number 5, which does not implement any logic to solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, the program should calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array. 

For instance, consider the following input case:

Input:
```
6 5
1 2 2 4 2 3
```

The expected output for this input is `3`, as we need to perform operations to increase some of the minimum elements or decrease some of the maximum elements to achieve at least 5 equal values in the array. 

However, the program does not perform any calculations or logic related to the input; it just outputs `5`. This clearly does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect.
