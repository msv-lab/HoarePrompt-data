The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, as well as a third parameter `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000,000.

After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the logic defined within it. However, since the specific return values or cases are not provided in the output section, we cannot detail them.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers, and processes these inputs to return a value based on the defined logic.**
