#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000,000.
def func():
    print(5)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and simply prints the number 5. It does not utilize the parameters `n`, `k`, and `a` as described in the annotations, which are irrelevant to the actual functionality of the code.
