You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given the array a consisting of n elements and the integer k ≤ n.

You want to obtain at least k equal elements in the array a. In one move, you can make one of the following two operations:

  * Take one of the minimum elements of the array and increase its value by one (more formally, if the minimum value of a is mn then you choose such index i that a_i = mn and set a_i := a_i + 1); 
  * take one of the maximum elements of the array and decrease its value by one (more formally, if the maximum value of a is mx then you choose such index i that a_i = mx and set a_i := a_i - 1). 



Your task is to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of elements in a and the required number of equal elements.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the i-th element of a.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000,000.
def func():
    print(5)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and simply prints the number 5. It does not utilize the parameters `n`, `k`, and `a` as described in the annotations, which are irrelevant to the actual functionality of the code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
