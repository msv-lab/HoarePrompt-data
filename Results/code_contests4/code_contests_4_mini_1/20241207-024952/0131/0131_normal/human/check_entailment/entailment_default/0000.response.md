The provided code simply prints the number 5, which does not fulfill any of the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of moves to obtain at least k equal elements in an array, using specific operations on the minimum and maximum elements of the array. The code does not take into account the input parameters n, k, and a, nor does it perform any calculations or logic to solve the problem.

The output hints state that the function accepts no parameters and only prints 5, which clearly does not relate to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code does not implement any logic to solve the problem as described. It ignores the input parameters and simply produces a constant output, which does not align with the requirements for calculating the minimum number of moves to achieve at least k equal elements in the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.
