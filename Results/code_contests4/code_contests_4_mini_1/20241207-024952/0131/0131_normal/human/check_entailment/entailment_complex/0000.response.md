Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that takes an array of integers and calculates the minimum number of moves needed to obtain at least `k` equal elements, utilizing operations to increment the smallest elements or decrement the largest elements.

However, the actual implementation of the function `func` simply prints the number 5 and does not take any parameters, nor does it perform any calculations or logic related to the input conditions of `n`, `k`, or the array `a`. As a result, it does not address the problem's requirements at all.

For example, using the input `6 5` followed by the array `1 2 2 4 2 3`, the expected output is 3. Instead, the program outputs a constant value of 5, which is not related to the required computation. The program's failure to perform any relevant operations confirms that it does not meet the problem description's demands.
