Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the minimum number of moves needed to obtain at least `k` equal elements in an array `a` using specified operations (increasing the minimum element or decreasing the maximum element). However, the provided function simply prints the number `5` without performing any calculations or operations related to the input parameters `n`, `k`, or the array `a`.

In a valid implementation, the function would need to analyze the elements of the array, determine the required operations to make at least `k` elements equal, and return the count of those operations. Since the current implementation does not do this, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
