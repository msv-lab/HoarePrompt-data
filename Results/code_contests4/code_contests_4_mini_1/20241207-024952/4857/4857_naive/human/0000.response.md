Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of cubes needed to build each level of the pyramid. Specifically, the line `x = x - i` does not correctly account for the cubes used in the current level; instead, it subtracts the cumulative total `i` rather than the required cubes for the current level, which should be `k`. 

To illustrate, consider the example when `n = 1`. The expected output is `1`, which is correct, as only one cube is needed for the first level. However, if we take `n = 3`, the expected output is `2` because the first level requires `1` cube and the second level requires `3` cubes (cumulative total of `1 + 2 = 3`), but the program would incorrectly process it by not properly checking the remaining cubes needed for each level.

This faulty logic will lead to incorrect outputs for various inputs, especially when the number of cubes is small but greater than 1.
