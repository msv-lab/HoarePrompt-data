Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built with the given number of cubes. 

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Variable Usage**:
   - The variable `i` is used to accumulate the total number of cubes used for the current height level. However, the way it is updated within the loop is not correct. The program adds `k` to `i`, and then subtracts `i` from `x`, which leads to incorrect calculations of the number of cubes used.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The correct logic involves checking against the triangular numbers, which are given by the formula \(T_i = \frac{i(i + 1)}{2}\) (1, 3, 6, 10, ...). The program's implementation does not accurately compute these triangular numbers; rather, it mistakenly modifies `i` and `x` in a way that does not reflect the cumulative number of cubes used for each level of the pyramid.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `while x - (i + k) >= 0` is incorrect. It should check whether the remaining number of cubes (`x`) is greater than or equal to the next triangular number that needs to be added for the next level.

4. **Output**:
   - The variable `c`, which counts the iterations, is intended to represent the height of the pyramid. However, due to the incorrect updates to `i` and `x`, `c` does not represent the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built.

### Conclusion:
Due to these flaws in logic and implementation, the program cannot be guaranteed to always produce the correct height of the pyramid based on the number of cubes provided. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements set out in the problem description.
