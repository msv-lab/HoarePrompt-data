To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it successfully computes the maximum height of a pyramid that can be built with a given number of cubes, following the specific pattern described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The pyramid is built in levels:
   - Level 1: 1 cube
   - Level 2: 3 cubes (1 + 2)
   - Level 3: 6 cubes (1 + 2 + 3)
   - Level i: Sum of the first i natural numbers, which is given by the formula: \( T_i = \frac{i(i + 1)}{2} \).

2. The goal is to find the maximum height `h` such that the total number of cubes used does not exceed `n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program reads an integer `x`, which represents the number of cubes.
2. **Variables**:
   - `i`: Tracks the cumulative number of cubes used to build the pyramid.
   - `k`: Represents the current level number (starting from 1).
   - `c`: Counts the number of levels successfully built.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are enough cubes left to build the next level, i.e., \( x - (i + k) \geq 0 \).
   - Within the loop:
     - The cumulative number of cubes used (`i`) is updated by adding the current levelâ€™s cubes (`k`).
     - The remaining cubes (`x`) are decreased by the number of cubes used in the current level.
     - The level counter (`c`) is incremented, and `k` is incremented for the next level.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints `c`, which represents the maximum number of levels built.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly follows the logic of progressively checking if enough cubes are available to build each level of the pyramid.
- The condition in the while loop effectively checks if the current level can be built with the remaining cubes.
- The use of `i` accumulates the total number of cubes used for the pyramid levels correctly, and `c` counts the number of levels that can be constructed.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 1`: The program will successfully determine that only level 1 can be built (output is `1`).
- For `n = 25`: The loop correctly calculates the levels (1, 3, 6, 10, 15) and stops before trying to exceed the available cubes.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements set in the problem description. It accurately calculates the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built with the given cubes.

Correctness: **True**
