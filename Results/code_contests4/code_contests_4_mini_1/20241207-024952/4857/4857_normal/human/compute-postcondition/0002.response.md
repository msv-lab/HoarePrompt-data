`k` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is 1**
