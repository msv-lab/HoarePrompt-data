The value of `i` is updated by adding `k` to it. The previous value of `i` is 3, and `k` is also 3. Therefore, after executing the code, `i` becomes 6 (3 + 3). The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 6; `k` is 3; `c` is 2; `x` is at least 6**
