`k` is assigned the value of `k + 1`. The previous value of `k` is 1, so after execution, `k` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `c`, `x`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 1; `k` is 2; `c` is 1; `x` is decreased by 1.  
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 1; `k` is 2; `c` is 1; `x` is decreased by 1**
