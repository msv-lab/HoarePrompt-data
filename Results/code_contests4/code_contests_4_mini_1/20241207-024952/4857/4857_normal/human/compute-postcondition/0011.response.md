The value of `x` is decreased by `i`, where `i` is 3. Since `x` is at least 3, the resulting value of `x` will be at least 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 1; `x` is at least 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 1; `x` is at least 0**
