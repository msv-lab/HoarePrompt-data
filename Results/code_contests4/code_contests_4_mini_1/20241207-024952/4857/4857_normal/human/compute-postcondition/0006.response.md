The variable `x` is decremented by the value of `i`, which is currently 1. However, the initial value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `c`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates the change to `x` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 0; `x` is decreased by 1.**
