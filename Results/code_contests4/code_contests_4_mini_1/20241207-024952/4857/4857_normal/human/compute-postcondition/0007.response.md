The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, after execution, `c` becomes 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 1; `x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 1; `x` is decreased by 1**
