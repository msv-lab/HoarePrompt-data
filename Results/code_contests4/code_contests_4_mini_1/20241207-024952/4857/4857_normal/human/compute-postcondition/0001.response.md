The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is being initialized to 0. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0**
