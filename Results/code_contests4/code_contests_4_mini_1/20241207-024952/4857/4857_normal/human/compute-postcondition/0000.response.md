The value of `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000; `x` is an input integer**
