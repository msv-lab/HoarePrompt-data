`k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is 3, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 6; `k` is 4; `c` is 3; `x` is at least 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 6; `k` is 4; `c` is 3; `x` is at least 0**
