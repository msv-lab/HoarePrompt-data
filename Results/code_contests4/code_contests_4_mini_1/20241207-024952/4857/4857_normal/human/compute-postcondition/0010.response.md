The value of `i` is incremented by `k`, which is 2. Since `i` is initially 1, after executing the code `i = i + k`, the new value of `i` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged, and there is no effect on `x` or any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 1; `x` is at least 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 3; `k` is 2; `c` is 1; `x` is at least 3**.
