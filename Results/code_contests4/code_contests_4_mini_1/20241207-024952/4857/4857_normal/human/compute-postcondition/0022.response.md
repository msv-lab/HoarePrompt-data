Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input from the user, which must be between 1 and 10,000. It calculates how many triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, etc.) can be subtracted from the input number until the remaining value becomes negative. The function then prints the count of these iterations. The function does not return a value; it only outputs the count. **
