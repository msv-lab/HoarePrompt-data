`x` is assigned the value of `x - i`. Given that `i` is 6, `x` will decrease by 6. Since `x` is at least 6, the new value of `x` will be at least 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 6; `k` is 3; `c` is 2; `x` is at least 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 6; `k` is 3; `c` is 2; `x` is at least 0**
