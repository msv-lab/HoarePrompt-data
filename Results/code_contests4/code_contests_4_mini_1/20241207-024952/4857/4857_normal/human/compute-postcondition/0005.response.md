The value of `i` is incremented by `k`, where `k` is 1. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, after executing `i = i + k`, the new value of `i` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `c` is 0**
