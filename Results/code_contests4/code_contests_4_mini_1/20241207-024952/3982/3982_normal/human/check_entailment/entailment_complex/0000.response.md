To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's analyze the key parts:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**:
   - We have `n` robbers and `m` searchlights.
   - Each robber can move either right (increasing x-coordinate) or up (increasing y-coordinate).
   - A configuration is safe if no searchlight can see any robber, defined by the condition `a_i ≤ c_j` and `b_i ≤ d_j`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of moves required to achieve a safe configuration.

2. **Key Functions and Logic**:
   - `func_1`: This is the main function that calculates the minimum moves required.
   - It first calculates the relative positions of searchlights to robbers (stored in `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`).
   - It then uses binary search to find the minimum number of moves needed to ensure all robbers are safe from all searchlights.

3. **Annotations and Their Implications**:
   - The annotations describe the state of the program throughout its execution.
   - They indicate that `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are filled with non-negative differences between searchlight and robber coordinates.
   - The binary search is used to check how many moves are needed to avoid being seen by any searchlight.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not seem to clearly define `INF`, which is used in the binary search logic. Without a defined value for `INF`, the program may encounter issues when performing comparisons.
   - The logic relies heavily on the conditions set in the problem description. If there are cases where all robbers' positions are initially safe, the program should return 0 moves needed, but we must ensure this logic is correctly implemented.
   - The function `func_3` raises a TypeError because it tries to add an integer to a tuple, which is not valid in Python. This suggests that the function might not work as intended, possibly affecting the input processing.

5. **Testing Against the Examples**:
   - The provided examples must return the expected output as per the problem description. However, if we consider the TypeError in `func_3`, this will prevent the program from executing correctly, leading to failure in all cases.
   - Additionally, the handling of edge cases (if all robbers are initially at the same position as searchlights) could lead to incorrect results depending on how the binary search is set up.

Based on this analysis, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description because of the unresolved issues in `func_3` and potential mismanagement of cases where all positions overlap.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails due to a TypeError in `func_3`, which prevents it from executing correctly for all inputs. Thus, it cannot be guaranteed to find the minimum moves required under all potential cases.
