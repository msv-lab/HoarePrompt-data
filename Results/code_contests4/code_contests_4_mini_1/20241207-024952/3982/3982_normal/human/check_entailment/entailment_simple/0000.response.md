Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Moves**: The program calculates the relative positions of robbers and searchlights, but the logic for determining the minimum number of moves to achieve a "safe" configuration is flawed. The goal is to determine how many total moves it takes to ensure that no searchlight can see any robber. The method used in the program does not directly compute the total moves needed to separate robbers from searchlights.

2. **Binary Search Logic Misapplication**: The use of binary search in the program is not justified for the problem at hand. The problem requires a direct computation of the maximum necessary moves to ensure safety from all searchlights, but the program attempts to apply a binary search approach that doesn't correctly address the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling of Input and Output**: The input and output handling in the program are muddled. For example, `func_3` is not properly used or defined, and it does not align with the expected input structure of the problem description. The input of coordinates should be handled in a way that accurately reflects the number of robbers and searchlights.

4. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not effectively handle edge cases, such as when there are multiple robbers at the same position or when the searchlights are at the extreme ends of the coordinate range.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirement to compute the minimum number of moves to reach a safe configuration, thus leading to an incorrect implementation overall.
