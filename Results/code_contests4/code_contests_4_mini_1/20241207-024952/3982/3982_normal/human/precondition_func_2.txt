o is a tuple where the first element is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (a_i, b_i) of n robbers and the second element is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (c_j, d_j) of m searchlights. The number of robbers n and the number of searchlights m are both integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and each coordinate value is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_j, d_j ≤ 10^6.
