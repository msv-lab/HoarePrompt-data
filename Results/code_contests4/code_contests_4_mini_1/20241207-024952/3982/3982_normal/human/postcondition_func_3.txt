The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `m`, where both are expected to be between 1 and 2000. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` exactly `n` times. The behavior and output of `func_2()` are not defined within the provided code, so the specific content of the returned list will depend on the implementation of `func_2()`.
