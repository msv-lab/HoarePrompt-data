The function accepts a tuple `o` containing lists of coordinates for robbers and searchlights. It reads a line of input consisting of space-separated integers, converts each integer to an integer type, and then adds each to the tuple `o` (although this addition does not logically make sense as `o` is a tuple). The function ultimately returns a list of these sums, but since the addition of an integer to a tuple is not valid Python syntax, the function will raise a TypeError. Therefore, the expected behavior is not achieved, and no valid output is produced.
