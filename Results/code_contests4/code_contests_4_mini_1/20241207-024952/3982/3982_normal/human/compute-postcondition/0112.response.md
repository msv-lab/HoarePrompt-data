The value of `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the value of `psum`. The initial value of `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, and the value of `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1] + avail[2]`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `avail` has valid values at indices 0, 1, and 2. The output state reflects that `psum_min` may either retain its previous value or take on the value of `psum` depending on the comparison. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1] + avail[2]`, `psum_min` is the minimum of `avail[0]` and `psum`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1] + avail[2]`, `psum_min` is the minimum of `avail[0]` and `psum`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[2]`.**
