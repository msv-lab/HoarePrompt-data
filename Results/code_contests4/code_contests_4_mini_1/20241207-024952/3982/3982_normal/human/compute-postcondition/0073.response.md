The code assigns the value of `rel_lights_x[i]` to `x`. However, we do not have information about the value of `rel_lights_x` or its contents at index `i`, which is currently 0. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s, `ans` is 500000, and `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]` (unknown)**.
