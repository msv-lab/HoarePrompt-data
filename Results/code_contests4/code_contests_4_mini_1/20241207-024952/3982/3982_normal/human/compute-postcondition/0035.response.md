According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If the list has at least `k + 1` tuples, the loop will execute again for the next tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `lx` and `ly` are the current tuple values, and the loop is set to retrieve the next tuple in the `lights` list. 

Given that `lights` contains at least `k + 1` tuples and we are currently processing the next tuple, the loop will continue as long as there are more tuples available in the `lights` list. If we've just processed the current tuple, the next tuple will be accessed, which means we need to adjust the state for the next iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider that `lx` and `ly` will take on the values of the next tuple in the list, and the loop will continue until all tuples are processed.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k + 1` tuples; `lx` and `ly` are the next tuple in the list; if `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then `rel_lights_x` includes the value `x` and `rel_lights_y` includes the value `y`.**
