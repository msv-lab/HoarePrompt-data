According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list `avail`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and since `n` is greater than 0, the index `i` does not affect the loop execution directly. However, the variable `ax` is updated with each element of the `avail` list during the loop execution.

Since the loop iterates over `avail`, which has a size of 1000002, for the loop to execute one more time, `ax` will take the value of the next element in the `avail` list. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `avail` to iterate over. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `ax` has been assigned the value of the last element in `avail` during the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ax` will be assigned the value of the next element in `avail`, which means we need to set `ax` to `avail[1]`. 

However, since `ax` iterates over the entire list, the loop will continue until all elements in `avail` have been processed. Thus, at the beginning of the next iteration, `ax` should be updated to the next value in the `avail` list.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, `psum` is `avail[0]`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[1]`**
