Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k + 1` tuples; if `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x` and `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
