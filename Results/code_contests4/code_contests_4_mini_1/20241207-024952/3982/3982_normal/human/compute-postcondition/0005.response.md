According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `robbers` variable. The loop will only execute if `robbers` contains at least one tuple (rx, ry). The values of `n` and `m` are within the specified range, but they do not directly affect the execution of the loop. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `robbers` must be populated with at least one tuple. This typically means that the function `func_4(n, 2)` should return a list with at least one element. 

Assuming `func_4` returns an empty list when there are no valid pairs, the state needs to be adjusted as follows: 

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000, for the loop to execute `robbers` is a list containing at least one tuple (rx, ry)**.
