The value of `ans` is assigned the result of the expression `l + (r - l) // 2`. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is 500000, we can calculate `ans` as follows:

1. Calculate `r - l`: 
   - `500000 - 0 = 500000`.
   
2. Perform integer division by 2:
   - `500000 // 2 = 250000`.

3. Add `l` to the result:
   - `0 + 250000 = 250000`.

Now, `ans` is updated to `250000`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 250000, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]**
