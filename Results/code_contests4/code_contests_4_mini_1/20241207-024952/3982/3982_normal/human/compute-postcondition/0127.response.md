The loop iterates from 0 to `ans` (which is 250000), setting each index in the `avail` list from 0 to `ans` to 0. After all iterations of the loop, all the indices from 0 to 250000 in `avail` will be set to 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `ans + 1`, which is 250001. 

Since `n` is greater than 0 and does not change during the loop, it remains greater than 0. The other variables such as `psum_min`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` will also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with indices 0 to 250000 set to 0, `ans` is 250000, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]**
