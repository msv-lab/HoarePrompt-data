According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `lights` list, which contains tuples. At the end of the last iteration, `lights` has at least two tuples, and `lx` is the first element of the second tuple, while `ly` is the second element of the second tuple. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples in the `lights` list.

Since the loop is iterating over the `lights` list, the next tuple will be accessed in the next iteration. If there are at least three tuples in `lights`, the loop can execute a third time. After the current iteration, if we assume there were two tuples processed (the first and the second), then the next tuple will be the third tuple.

Therefore, if `lights` has at least three tuples, then for the loop to execute one more time, we will need to set `lx` and `ly` to the first and second elements of the third tuple in `lights`, respectively.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least three tuples; `lx` is the first element of the third tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the third tuple in `lights`.**
