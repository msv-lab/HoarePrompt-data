Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250003, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250003]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250003]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, and `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` remains unchanged.***
