According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `ans`. For the loop to execute again after the last iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 250001 and `ans` must be at least 250001, meaning that it can be equal to or greater than 250001.

Since `i` is currently 250001, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 250002. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `ans` must be at least 250002.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with `avail[250001]` set to 0, `ans` must be at least 250002, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`**
