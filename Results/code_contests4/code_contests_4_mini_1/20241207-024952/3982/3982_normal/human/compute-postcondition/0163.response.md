According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If `avail` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least one element, `psum` is equal to `ax`, and `psum_min` is now equal to `ax`. After the last iteration, the next value of `ax` will be the next element in `avail`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `avail` must have at least 2 elements, and `ax` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `avail` must contain at least 2 elements, and `ax` will be the next element in `avail`.**
