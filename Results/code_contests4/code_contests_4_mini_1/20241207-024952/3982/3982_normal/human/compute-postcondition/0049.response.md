To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the assignment `x, y = lx - rx, ly - ry`. 

1. The variables `lx` and `ly` are defined as the first and second elements of the second tuple in the list `lights`. 
2. The code assigns `x` the value of `lx - rx` and `y` the value of `ly - ry`.
3. The values of `rx` and `ry` are not provided in the initial state, but `lx` and `ly` are defined as the first and second elements of the second tuple in `lights`.

Since we do not have the specific values for `rx`, `ry`, `lx`, and `ly`, we cannot compute specific values for `x` and `y`. However, we acknowledge that `x` and `y` are assigned based on the specified calculations.

Thus, the output state will reflect the assignments made without giving specific numerical values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least 2 tuples; `lx` is the first element of the second tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the second tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`.**
