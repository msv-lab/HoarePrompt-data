Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least 3 tuples; `lx` is the first element of the third tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the third tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` now contains the previous elements plus `x`; `rel_lights_y` now contains the previous elements plus `y`.**
