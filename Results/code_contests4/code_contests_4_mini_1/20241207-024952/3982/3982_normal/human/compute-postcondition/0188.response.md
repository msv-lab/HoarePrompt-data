The variable `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`. We first need to calculate the expression inside `max`. 

Given:
- `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[ans + 1]`
- `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`
- `ans` is less than `n - 1`, and since `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is at least 0.

Calculating the expression:
1. We compute `x + y - ans`.
2. Then we compute `x - (x + y - ans)`, which simplifies to `-y + ans`.
3. Finally, we take the maximum of `0` and `-y + ans`.

This means:
- If `-y + ans` is greater than 0, then `sp` will be `-y + ans`.
- If `-y + ans` is less than or equal to 0, then `sp` will be `0`.

Thus, `sp` depends on the values of `y` and `ans`, but we do not have specific values for either. Therefore, we state the relationship.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + 1`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[ans + 1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, and `sp` is either `-y + ans` or `0` based on the computed value.**
