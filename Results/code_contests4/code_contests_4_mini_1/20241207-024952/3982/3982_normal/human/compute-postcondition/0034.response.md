Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k + 1` tuples; `lx` and `ly` are the next tuple in the list; if `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then `rel_lights_x` includes the value `x` and `rel_lights_y` includes the value `y`.***
