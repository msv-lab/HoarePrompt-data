The code assigns `psum_min` the minimum value between its current value and `psum`. The previous value of `psum_min` is `INF`, and `psum` is equal to `ax`, which is the first element in `avail`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is a valid value. 

Thus, after executing the line of code, `psum_min` will be updated to the minimum of `INF` and `ax`, which will be `ax`, as it is less than `INF`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least one element, `psum` is equal to `ax`, `psum_min` is now equal to `ax`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least one element, `psum` is equal to `ax`, `psum_min` is now equal to `ax`.**
