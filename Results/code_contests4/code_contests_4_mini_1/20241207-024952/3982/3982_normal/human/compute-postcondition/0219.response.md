According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If the list has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and `psum`, where `psum` has been incremented by `ax`. If `ax` is the last element of the `avail` list, then it indicates that `avail` has been traversed. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, we need to increase the index of the `avail` list, which is the next element that `ax` will take. Therefore, if there are more elements in `avail`, the next value of `ax` will be the next element from `avail`, and `psum` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`psum_min` is the minimum of its previous value and `psum`, for the loop to execute a second time `avail` must contain at least one more element after the current one, and `ax` will be the next element in the `avail` list.**
