Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250003, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250003]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250003]`, `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, and `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. If `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[sp]` is increased by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `avail[sp]` remains increased by 1, and no changes are made to `avail[ep + 1]`.***
