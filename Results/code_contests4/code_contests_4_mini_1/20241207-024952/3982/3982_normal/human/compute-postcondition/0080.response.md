The code `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` decrements the value at index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list. Since `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` (500000) and `x`, and considering `ep` is less than `ans`, it can be inferred that `ep` is less than or equal to 500000. The list `avail` is filled with 0s initially, so the operation will change the value at index `ep + 1` from 0 to -1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s except for index `ep + 1` which is -1, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`, `sp` is either 0 or a positive value based on the specific value of `y`, `ep` is assigned a value less than or equal to 500000.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s except for index `ep + 1` which is -1, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[0]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[0]`, `sp` is either 0 or a positive value based on the specific value of `y`, `ep` is assigned a value less than or equal to 500000.**
