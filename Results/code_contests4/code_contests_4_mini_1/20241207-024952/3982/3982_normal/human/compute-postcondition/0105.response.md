The code `psum += ax` adds the value of `ax` to `psum`. Given that `ax` is the first element of the `avail` list, and since `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ax` is `avail[0]`. The previous value of `psum` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `psum` will be equal to `avail[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF`, `psum` is `avail[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ax` is `avail[0]`.**
