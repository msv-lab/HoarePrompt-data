The value of `psum` is incremented by `ax`. Since `ax` is the first element in `avail`, which contains at least one element, `ax` has a specific value. The previous value of `psum` is 0, so after execution, `psum` will be equal to `ax`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least one element, `psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF`, `psum` is equal to `ax`, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least one element, `psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF`, `psum` is equal to `ax`, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
