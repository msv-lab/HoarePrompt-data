According to the code, the loop will iterate over the `avail` list. For the loop to execute at least once, the `avail` list must contain at least one element. Since the state indicates that `avail` is a list of size 1000002, it suggests that it is not empty, allowing the loop to execute.

The initial conditions state that `n` is greater than 0, which indicates that there are valid indices for accessing `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`. The value of `i` being `n` implies that it is set to a valid position based on the value of `n`.

However, we need to ensure that `ax` will be assigned the first element from `avail` when the loop begins its first iteration. Since `avail` is a list, the first iteration will set `ax` to `avail[0]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF`, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ax` is the first element of the `avail` list (`avail[0]`)**.
