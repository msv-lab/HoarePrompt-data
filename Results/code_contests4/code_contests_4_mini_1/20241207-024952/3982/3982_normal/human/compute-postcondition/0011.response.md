Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least one tuple; `lx` is the first element of the first tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then `rel_lights_x` includes the value of `x` and `rel_lights_y` includes the value of `y`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`.***
