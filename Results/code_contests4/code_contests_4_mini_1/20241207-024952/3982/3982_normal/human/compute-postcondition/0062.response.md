The code initializes a list `avail` with a size of \(10^6 + 1 + 1\) (which is \(1000002\)). All elements in this list are set to `0`. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this operation, so we only need to note the new state of `avail`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` contains at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k` tuples; `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with non-negative values; `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001; `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s.**
