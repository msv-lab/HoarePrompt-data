According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `lights` list. The loop iterates over each tuple in `lights`, and since `lights` contains at least `k` tuples, it will execute for the first `k` tuples. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have processed the first `k` tuples, meaning that `lx` and `ly` will represent the `k`-th tuple in `lights`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least `k + 1` tuples in `lights`, meaning that the loop can iterate one more time to access the tuple at index `k`. Therefore, after processing the `k`-th tuple, the next tuple to be processed will be the `(k + 1)`-th tuple, and the loop will increment the index accordingly.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k + 1` tuples, `lx` and `ly` are the next tuple in the list, and the loop will execute for the `(k + 1)`-th time.**
