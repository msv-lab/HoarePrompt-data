The value of `x` is assigned the element at index `i` (which is 250002) from the list `rel_lights_x`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 250002, it implies that `n` is at least 250003 or more. However, the specific value of `rel_lights_x[250002]` is not provided and cannot be determined from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the assignment of `x` and the conditions around `n` and `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250002]**.
