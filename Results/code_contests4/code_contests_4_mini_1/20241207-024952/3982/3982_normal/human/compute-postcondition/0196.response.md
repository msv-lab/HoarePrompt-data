The variable `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, where `i` is `ans + 2`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, but the specific values of `rel_lights_x` and `ans` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment without specific values for `x` or `rel_lights_x[i]`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`**.
