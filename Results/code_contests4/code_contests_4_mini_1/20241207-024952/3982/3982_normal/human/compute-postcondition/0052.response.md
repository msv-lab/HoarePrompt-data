Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least 2 tuples; `lx` is the first element of the second tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the second tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; if `x` and `y` are both non-negative, then `rel_lights_x` contains the previous elements plus the value of `x`, and `rel_lights_y` contains the previous elements plus the value of `y`.***
