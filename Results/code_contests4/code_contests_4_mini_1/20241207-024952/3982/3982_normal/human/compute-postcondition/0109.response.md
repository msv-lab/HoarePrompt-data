The value of `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `psum`. The previous value of `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, and `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1]`. Therefore, `psum_min` will be the minimum of `avail[0]` and `avail[0] + avail[1]`. Since `avail[0]` is less than or equal to `avail[0] + avail[1]`, `psum_min` remains `avail[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1]`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[1]` and `psum_min` remains `avail[0]`.**
