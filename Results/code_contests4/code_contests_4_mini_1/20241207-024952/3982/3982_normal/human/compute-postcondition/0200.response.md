The code `avail[sp] += 1` increments the value at index `sp` of the array `avail` by 1. The value of `sp` is determined by the expression `max(0, -y + ans)`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `ep`) are not affected by this operation.

Since `sp` will be greater than or equal to `0` (because of the `max` function), `avail[sp]` will be incremented by 1.

The output state reflects that `avail[sp]` has increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, -y + ans), `ep` is min(ans, x); `avail[sp]` is increased by 1.**
