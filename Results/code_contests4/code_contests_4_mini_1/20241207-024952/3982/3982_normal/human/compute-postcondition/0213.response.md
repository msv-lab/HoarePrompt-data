Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, each element of `avail` has been updated according to the loop logic, where `avail[sp]` has been incremented based on the calculations of `sp` and `ep` for each iteration, and `avail` reflects the cumulative changes from all iterations of the loop.**
