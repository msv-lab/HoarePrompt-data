According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. The loop will iterate over each tuple in `lights`. Since `lights` contains at least 2 tuples at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration will process the third tuple, assuming there are more than 2 tuples.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already processed the first tuple and the second tuple. The values `lx` and `ly` were assigned from the second tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, it should process the third tuple in `lights`. 

Thus, `lx` and `ly` will be assigned the first and second elements of the third tuple, respectively. The loop index effectively moves to the next tuple in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `lx` is the first element of the third tuple in `lights`, `ly` is the second element of the third tuple in `lights`.**
