According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `lights`. If `lights` has more tuples, the loop will execute for the next tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `lx` is the first element of the first tuple in `lights`, and `ly` is the second element of the first tuple in `lights`. The loop processes each tuple in `lights` sequentially.

If the loop has executed for the first tuple, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to access the next tuple in the list. Therefore, if `lights` contains at least two tuples, then on the next iteration `lx` will be the first element of the second tuple in `lights`, and `ly` will be the second element of the second tuple in `lights`.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least two tuples; `lx` is the first element of the second tuple in `lights`, `ly` is the second element of the second tuple in `lights`.**
