The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The value of `ans` is unknown, but since `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `x` is defined as `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, which means `x` has some value depending on the index `ans + 2`. The minimum value between `ans` and `x` will determine `ep`.

Since `ans` is not specified and `x` is dependent on `rel_lights_x`, the exact values of `ep`, `ans`, and `x` cannot be determined. However, we can conclude that `ep` will be the lesser of the two values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, -y + ans), and `ep` is min(ans, x).

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, -y + ans), `ep` is min(ans, x)**
