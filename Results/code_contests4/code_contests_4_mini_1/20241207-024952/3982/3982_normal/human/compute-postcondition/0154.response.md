In the given initial state, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250003, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250003]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250003]`, `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`, and `avail[sp]` is increased by 1.

The code snippet modifies the `avail` array by decreasing the value at the index `ep + 1` by 1. The previous values of `avail[sp]` and `avail[ep + 1]` are not affected directly by this operation, but we do know that `avail[sp]` has already been increased by 1 in the initial state.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes made by the code snippet. Since we don't have the specific values for `ep` and `avail[ep + 1]`, we can't provide concrete numbers, but we can indicate that the operation has been performed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250003, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250003]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250003]`, `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
