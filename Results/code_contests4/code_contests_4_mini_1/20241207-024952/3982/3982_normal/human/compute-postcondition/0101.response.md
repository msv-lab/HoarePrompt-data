Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 that reflects the changes made during the loop execution, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`. If for any `i` in range `n`, `x + y >= ans`, then `sp` and `ep` will be calculated accordingly, and the `avail` array will be updated based on the respective values of `sp` and `ep`.**
