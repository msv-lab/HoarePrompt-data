Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least `n` elements, and `psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is greater than 0, then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`.***
