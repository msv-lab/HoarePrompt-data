According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is initialized to 250001, but since the loop will set `i` to 0 on the first iteration, this is acceptable.

Since `n` is already greater than 0, we don't need to adjust that. However, we do need to consider the loop's iteration conditions. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, for the loop to execute the first time `i` will be 0**
