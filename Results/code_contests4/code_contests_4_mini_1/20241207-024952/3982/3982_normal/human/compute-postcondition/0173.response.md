The variable `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. However, the value of `ans` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least `n` elements; `psum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is greater than 0, and `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1` (where `ans` is undefined).**
