The value of `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 250003. The initial state indicates that `rel_lights_y` is an array or list, and the specific value of `rel_lights_y[250003]` is assumed to exist and be accessible. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged and are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250003, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250003]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250003, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250003]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250003]`**.
