Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, and `ans` is 500000. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `l` is 0 and `r` is 500000 with `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`. Otherwise, `l` is 500001 and `r` is 1000001, with `x` still assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, and `psum_min` being greater than 0. `psum_min` remains the minimum of all elements in `avail`, and `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`.***
