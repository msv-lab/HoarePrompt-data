Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]` and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is calculated as max(0, ans - y), and `ep` is assigned the value min(ans, x). If `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
