`rel_lights_y` is modified by appending the value of `y` to it. The value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0, so after execution, `rel_lights_y` will contain one more element, which is `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k + 1` tuples; `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`; `y` is greater than or equal to 0; `rel_lights_y` has `y` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k + 1` tuples; `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`; `y` is greater than or equal to 0; `rel_lights_y` has `y` appended to it.**
