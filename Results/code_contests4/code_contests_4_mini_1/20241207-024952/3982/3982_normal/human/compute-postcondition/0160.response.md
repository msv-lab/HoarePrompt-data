According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `avail`. The loop will execute if `avail` contains at least one element. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0, which allows for `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` to be indexed properly, and the values for `x` and `y` have been assigned. 

However, the state of `avail` must be such that it is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `avail` has been populated with values during the previous calculations based on the `n` iterations. If `avail` is empty, the loop cannot execute.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `avail` must contain at least one element, and `ax` is assigned the first element of `avail`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` contains at least one element, `psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF`, `psum` is 0, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
