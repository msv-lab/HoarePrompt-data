To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet:

1. The variable `sp` is calculated as `max(0, 500000 - y)`. Since `y` is assigned a value from `rel_lights_y[1]`, we need to consider that `sp` will either be `500000 - y` (if it's non-negative) or `0` (if `500000 - y` is negative).
2. The variable `avail` is a list with indices ranging from `0` to `1000001`, and it is filled with `0`s, except for the index `ep + 1` which is `-1`.
3. With the line `avail[sp] += 1`, the value at index `sp` of the list `avail` is incremented by `1`.

Since we don't have specific values for `y`, `x`, or `ep`, we can summarize the effect of the code:

- The value at index `sp` in the list `avail` is increased by `1`. The exact value of `sp` depends on the value of `y`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the increment in the `avail` list at the index determined by `sp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is max(0, 500000 - y), `ep` is either `x` or `500000`**.
