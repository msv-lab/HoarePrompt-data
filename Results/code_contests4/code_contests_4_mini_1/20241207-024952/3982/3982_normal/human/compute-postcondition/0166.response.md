According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If `avail` contains at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` has at least 2 elements, and `ax` is assigned the next element in `avail`. Since `ax` will take the next element, for the loop to execute one more time, `avail` must have at least 3 elements. Additionally, after the iteration, `ax` will be assigned the next element in the list, which means `ax` must be the third element in `avail`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`; `avail` contains at least 3 elements; `ax` will be the third element in `avail`; `psum` will be increased by `ax`; `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `psum`.**
