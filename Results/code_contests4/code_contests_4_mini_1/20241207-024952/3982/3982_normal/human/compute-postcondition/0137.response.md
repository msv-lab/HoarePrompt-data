Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250001]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250001]`, `sp` is either 0 or `ans - y`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
