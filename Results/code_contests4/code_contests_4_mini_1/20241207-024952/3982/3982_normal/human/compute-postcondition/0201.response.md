The code `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` decreases the value at the index `ep + 1` in the list `avail` by 1. The previous values of the variables are `n` greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, -y + ans), and `ep` is min(ans, x). The calculation affects only the `avail` array, specifically at the index `ep + 1`, but the exact value of `avail[ep + 1]` prior to the decrement is unknown.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, -y + ans), `ep` is min(ans, x), and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`, `sp` is max(0, -y + ans), `ep` is min(ans, x), and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
