Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 2]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 2]`. If the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is computed as max(0, -y + ans), `ep` is computed as min(ans, x), and if `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
