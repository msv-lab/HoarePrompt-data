The code `avail[sp] += 1` increments the value at the index `sp` of the list `avail` by 1. The previous state indicates that `sp` has been assigned a calculated maximum value from the expression, but the specific value of `sp` is not provided. Therefore, we can only state that the operation will affect the index `sp` of the `avail` list, increasing that specific element by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `y`, and `ep` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250002]`, `sp` is assigned a maximum value based on the expression, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and `avail[sp]` is increased by 1.**
