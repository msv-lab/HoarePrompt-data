To analyze the output state after all iterations of the nested for loops have executed, we can derive the relationships and values of the variables based on the given code and initial state.

The outer loop iterates over each tuple `(rx, ry)` in `robbers`, and for each robber, the inner loop iterates over each tuple `(lx, ly)` in `lights`. For each pair of robber and light, the expressions `x = lx - rx` and `y = ly - ry` are calculated. If both `x` and `y` are non-negative, their values are added to the lists `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`.

After all iterations of the loops, the following conditions hold:

- `n` and `m` remain integers within the range of 1 to 2000.
- `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples (as determined by the output states after the loop executes a few times).
- `robbers` is a list of tuples containing at least `k` tuples.
- `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for each `(lx, ly)` in `lights` where `ly - ry` is also non-negative across all robbers.
- `rel_lights_y` contains all corresponding non-negative values of `ly - ry` for each `(lx, ly)` in `lights` where `lx - rx` is also non-negative across all robbers.

If the lists `robbers` and `lights` are non-empty, then `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` will contain the non-negative adjusted coordinates of lights based on the positions of all robbers.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples; `robbers` is a list containing at least `k` tuples; `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values of `lx - rx` for all tuples in `lights` for which `ly - ry` is non-negative across all robbers; `rel_lights_y` contains all corresponding non-negative values of `ly - ry`.**
