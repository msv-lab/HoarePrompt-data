According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `lights` list, which contains tuples. The loop will iterate once for each tuple in the `lights` list. Given that `lights` contains at least `k` tuples, the loop will execute at least `k` times.

For the loop to execute one more time, it is specified that `robbers` must contain at least `k + 1` tuples, meaning that there is an additional tuple available in `robbers` that has not yet been processed. Furthermore, `(rx, ry)` will represent the next tuple in `robbers`, indicating that a specific tuple from `robbers` is to be used in the next iteration.

Thus, the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute one more time are:
- `robbers` contains at least `k + 1` tuples.
- `(rx, ry)` is the next tuple in `robbers`.

The current state indicates `n` and `m` are within valid ranges, and `lights` is appropriately populated. 

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000, `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples, for the loop to execute one more time `robbers` must contain at least `k + 1` tuples, and `(rx, ry)` will be the next tuple in `robbers.**
