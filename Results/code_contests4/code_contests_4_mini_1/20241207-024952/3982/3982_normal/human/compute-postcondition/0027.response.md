The code appends the value of `x` to the list `rel_lights_x`. Since `x` is calculated as `lx - rx`, and both `lx` and `rx` are part of the tuples in the lists, we know that `x` is greater than or equal to 0 based on the initial state.

The variable `rel_lights_x` is affected by this operation, and its previous state is not specified, but it now contains the value of `x` appended to it. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k + 1` tuples; `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.**
