`rel_lights_x` is updated to include the value of `x`, which is currently assigned the value `lx - rx`. The previous states of `x` and `y` are not directly affected, but `rel_lights_x` will now contain the current value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, and `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`, and `rel_lights_x` now includes the value of `x`**
