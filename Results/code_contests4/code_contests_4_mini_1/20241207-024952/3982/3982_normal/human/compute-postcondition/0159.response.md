The variable `psum` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables, which retain their previous states. Thus, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new assignment for `psum`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` is updated based on the calculations for all `n` iterations, where `sp` and `ep` are determined for each iteration, resulting in `avail` reflecting the modifications made during the loop based on the conditions met; `psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF`; `psum` is 0**.
