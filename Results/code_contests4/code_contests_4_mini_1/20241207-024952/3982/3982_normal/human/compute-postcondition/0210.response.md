The line of code `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` decrements the value at index `ep + 1` of the `avail` array by 1. This operation affects the `avail` variable based on the current value of `ep`, which is not specified in the initial state. However, the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Since `ep` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `avail[ep + 1]` after the operation. Therefore, we can only state that the value at index `ep + 1` in `avail` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 3`, `i` is `ans + 3`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 3]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 3]`, `sp` is max(0, ans - y); `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1.**
