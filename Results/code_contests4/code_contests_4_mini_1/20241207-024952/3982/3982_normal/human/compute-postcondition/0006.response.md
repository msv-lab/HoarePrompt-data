According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` variable. For the loop to execute, `lights` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `n` and `m` do not directly affect the loop execution since they are not involved in the loop's iteration logic. Additionally, `lx` and `ly` will take on the values of the first tuple in the `lights` list when the loop executes for the first time.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `lights` should contain at least one tuple, and `lx` and `ly` should be initialized to the first values of that tuple.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000, for the loop to execute `lights` is a list containing at least one tuple, `lx` is the first element of the first tuple in lights, `ly` is the second element of the first tuple in lights**
