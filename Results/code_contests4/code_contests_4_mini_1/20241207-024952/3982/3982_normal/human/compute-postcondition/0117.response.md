The value of `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` is 500000, the new value of `l` will be 500001. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 500001, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is the minimum of all elements in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, and the minimum of all elements in `avail` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 500001, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is the minimum of all elements in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, and the minimum of all elements in `avail` is greater than 0.**
