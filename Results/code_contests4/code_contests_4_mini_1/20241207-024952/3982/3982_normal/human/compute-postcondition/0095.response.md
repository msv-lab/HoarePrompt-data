To determine the output state, we start with the initial conditions. We have `n > 0`, `i = 2`, `x = rel_lights_x[2]`, and `y = rel_lights_y[2]`.

The code snippet is:
```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

1. The variable `sp` is assigned the value of `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`.
2. The expression inside the `max` function evaluates to `x - (x + y - ans)`. 
3. This simplifies to `x - x - y + ans`, which further simplifies to `ans - y`.
4. The value of `sp` will be the maximum of `0` and `ans - y`.

Since we do not know the specific values of `x`, `y`, or `ans`, we can only express the relationship based on the variables. The values of `x` and `y` depend on the lists `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`, respectively, but they are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Thus, the output state will reflect that `sp` is determined by these variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `sp` is max(0, ans - y) where `x` is rel_lights_x[2] and `y` is rel_lights_y[2]**.
