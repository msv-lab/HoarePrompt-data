The code initializes `rel_lights_y` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `m`, `robbers`, and `lights` are not affected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the affected variables and the new assignment for `rel_lights_y`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `robbers` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(n, 2); `lights` is assigned the value returned by `func_4(m, 2); `rel_lights_x` is an empty list; `rel_lights_y` is an empty list.**
