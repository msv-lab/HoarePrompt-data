To evaluate the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `n` is greater than `ans + 2`
- `i` is `ans + 2`
- `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`
- `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`

Next, we analyze the line of code:

```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

Calculating the expression inside the `max` function:

1. The expression `x + y - ans` is evaluated first.
2. Then, we calculate `x - (x + y - ans)`, which simplifies to `x - x - y + ans`, resulting in `-y + ans`.
3. Finally, we take the maximum between `0` and `-y + ans`.

Since `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `ans` must be less than `n - 2`. However, the exact values of `x` and `y` depend on the values in the lists `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` at index `i`, which is `ans + 2`. Therefore, without specific values for `rel_lights_x[i]` and `rel_lights_y[i]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `sp`.

Given that the values of `x` and `y` are unknown but derived from the lists, we summarize the output state in a way that reflects that `sp` is determined based on these variables. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is rel_lights_x[ans + 2], `y` is rel_lights_y[ans + 2], `sp` is max(0, -y + ans)**
