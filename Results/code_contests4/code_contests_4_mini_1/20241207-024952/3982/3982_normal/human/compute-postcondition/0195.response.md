According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ans + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, resulting in `i` being `ans + 2`. Since `n` is greater than `i`, we can state that `n` must be greater than `ans + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`**
