Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k + 1` tuples; `(rx, ry)` is the next tuple in `robbers; x` and `y` are assigned the values `lx - rx` and `ly - ry` respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are both greater than or equal to 0.***
