The value of `sp` is assigned the maximum of `0` and the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`. To evaluate this, we simplify the expression:

1. The expression inside the `max` function is `x - (x + y - ans)`.
2. This simplifies to `x - x - y + ans`, which further simplifies to `ans - y`.

Since we know that `ans` is greater than or equal to `x + y`, we can analyze the two cases:

- If `ans - y` is greater than `0`, then `sp` would be `ans - y`.
- If `ans - y` is less than or equal to `0`, then `sp` would be `0`.

The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than `0`, `i` is `250001`, and the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`. Therefore, we can't definitively say the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, but we can deduce the general behavior of `sp`.

Since `x` and `y` are derived from `rel_lights_x[250001]` and `rel_lights_y[250001]`, we do not have specific values for them, but we can conclude that `sp` is assigned a value that is either `0` or `ans - y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250001]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250001]`, and `sp` is either 0 or `ans - y`.**
