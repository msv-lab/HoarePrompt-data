The line of code `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` affects the variable `avail`. The value of `ep` is either `x` or `500000`, but the specific value of `avail[ep + 1]` is not provided. Thus, we cannot determine the exact value of `avail[ep + 1]` before the operation.

Since `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1, the output state reflects that `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1, without specifying the exact result of that decrement.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is max(0, 500000 - y), `ep` is either `x` or `500000`, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
