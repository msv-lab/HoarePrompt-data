The statement `avail[ep + 1] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `ep + 1` in the `avail` array by 1. The value of `ep` is assigned as the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. Since `ep` is less than `ans`, it indicates that `ep + 1` is a valid index in the `avail` array.

The initial state provides that `sp` is either 0 or `ans - y`, and `ep` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `ans` and `x`. However, the specific values of `ans`, `x`, and `avail` are not provided. Therefore, we can only conclude the impact of the operation on the `avail` array.

Overall, the operation reduces the value of `avail[ep + 1]` by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250001]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250001]`, `sp` is either 0 or `ans - y`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, `ep` is less than `ans`, and `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
