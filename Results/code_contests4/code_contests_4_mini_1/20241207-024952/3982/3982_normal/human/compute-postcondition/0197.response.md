`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. The value of `i` is `ans + 2`, and since `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, the program does not affect `n` or `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 2`, `i` is `ans + 2`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`**
