According to the code, the loop condition `l < r` determines whether the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is 1000001. Since `0 < 1000001`, the loop can indeed execute. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the variables for the loop to run the first time.

State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` contains at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k` tuples; `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with non-negative values; `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001; `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s.**
