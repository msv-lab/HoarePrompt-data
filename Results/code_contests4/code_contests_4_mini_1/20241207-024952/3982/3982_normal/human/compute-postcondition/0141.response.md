`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 250002. The value of `y` will depend on the contents of `rel_lights_y` at the index 250002. Since the specific value of `rel_lights_y[250002]` is not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `y`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250002]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250002]**
