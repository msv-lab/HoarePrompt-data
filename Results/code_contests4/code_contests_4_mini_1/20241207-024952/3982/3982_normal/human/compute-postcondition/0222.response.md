According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` iterable. The loop will execute again for the next element in `avail`. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is the minimum of its previous value and `psum`, and `psum` has been increased by `ax`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next value in `avail`.

If `ax` was the last element in `avail`, then the loop cannot execute again. But if there are more elements, we will have a new value of `ax`, and `psum` will be updated accordingly.

Assuming `avail` has at least one more element after the last iteration, we will set `ax` to the next element in `avail`.

State: **`psum_min` is the minimum of its previous value and `psum`, `psum` is updated accordingly with the next value of `ax` in `avail`**
