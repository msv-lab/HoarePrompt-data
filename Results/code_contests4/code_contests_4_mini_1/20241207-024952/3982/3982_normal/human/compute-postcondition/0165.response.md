The value of `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `psum`. The variable `psum` has been increased by `ax`, which is the next element in `avail`, but the specific previous value of `psum` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `psum_min`, only that it will be the minimum of its previous value and the updated `psum`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`; `avail` contains at least 2 elements; `ax` will be the next element in `avail`; `psum` is increased by `ax`; `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `psum`.**
