Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250002]`. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `sp` is assigned a maximum value based on the expression, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is increased by 1, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
