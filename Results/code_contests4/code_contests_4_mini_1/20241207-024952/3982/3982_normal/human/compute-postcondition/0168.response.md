The `psum_min` variable is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and the current value of `psum`. Since `psum` has been increased by `ax`, the actual values of `psum` and `psum_min` will determine the new value of `psum_min`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `avail`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of those variables and the new state of `psum_min`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`; `avail` contains at least 3 elements; `ax` is the third element in `avail`; `psum` is increased by `ax`; `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `psum`.**
