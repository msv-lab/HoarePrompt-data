The variable `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, which typically represents infinity in many programming contexts. This assignment does not depend on the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, or `avail`, and it does not affect them either. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `psum_min`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, each element of `avail` has been updated according to the loop logic, where `avail[sp]` has been incremented based on the calculations of `sp` and `ep` for each iteration, and `psum_min` is assigned the value of INF.**
