`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 2. The value of `rel_lights_y[2]` is used to determine `y`, but the specific value of `rel_lights_y[2]` is unknown at this moment. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[2]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[2]`.**
