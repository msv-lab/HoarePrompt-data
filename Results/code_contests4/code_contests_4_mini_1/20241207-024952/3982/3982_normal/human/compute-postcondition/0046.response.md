The code `rel_lights_y.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `rel_lights_y`. The previous state indicates that `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `rel_lights_y` is a list that is being modified by adding this new value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least 1 tuple; `lx` is the first element of the first tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the first tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0; `rel_lights_x` now contains the value of `x` appended to it; `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.**
