Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is max(0, 500000 - y), `ep` is either `x` or `500000`, and if `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.***
