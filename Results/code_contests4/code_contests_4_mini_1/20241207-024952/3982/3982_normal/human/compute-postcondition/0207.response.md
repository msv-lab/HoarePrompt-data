To analyze the given code snippet, we start with the initial state:

- `n` is greater than `ans + 3`.
- `i` is `ans + 3`.
- `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 3]`.
- `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`.

Now, we evaluate the expression:

```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
```

We can simplify the expression inside `max`:

1. The value of `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 3]`.
2. The value of `y` is `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is `ans + 3`.
3. The expression `x + y - ans` will combine the values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`.

Thus, we can rewrite `sp` as:

```
sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans)) = max(0, x - x - y + ans) = max(0, ans - y)
```

From this, we can deduce:

- If `ans - y` is greater than or equal to 0, `sp` will be equal to `ans - y`.
- If `ans - y` is less than 0, `sp` will be 0.

Since we don't have specific values for `ans` or `y`, but we know that `y` is assigned from `rel_lights_y[i]`, we conclude that `sp` is dependent on those values.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the variables and the derived expression for `sp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 3`, `i` is `ans + 3`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 3]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is max(0, ans - y)**.
