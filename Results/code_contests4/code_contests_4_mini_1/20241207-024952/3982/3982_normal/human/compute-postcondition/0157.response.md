Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `avail` is updated based on the calculations for all `n` iterations, where `sp` and `ep` are determined for each iteration, resulting in `avail` reflecting the modifications made during the loop based on the conditions met.**
