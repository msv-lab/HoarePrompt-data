According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ans + 2`, and `n` is greater than `ans + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `ans + 3`. 

Since `n` is greater than `ans + 2`, it is still valid for the loop to execute again as long as `n` remains greater than `ans + 3`.

State: **`n` is greater than `ans + 3`, `i` is `ans + 3`, `x` is `rel_lights_x[ans + 3]`, `y` is `rel_lights_y[ans + 3]`.**
