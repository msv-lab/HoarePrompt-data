According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 250002, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 250003. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 250003.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250003, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 250003**
