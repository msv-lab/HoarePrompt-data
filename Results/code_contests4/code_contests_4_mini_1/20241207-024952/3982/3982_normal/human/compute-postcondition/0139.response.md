According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 250001, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 250002 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 250002.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 250002**
