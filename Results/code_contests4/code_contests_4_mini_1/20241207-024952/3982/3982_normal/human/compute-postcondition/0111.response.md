The variable `psum` is updated by adding the value of `ax` to it. The previous value of `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1]`, and the value of `ax` is `avail[2]`. Therefore, after execution, `psum` becomes `avail[0] + avail[1] + avail[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1] + avail[2]`, `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[2]`.**
