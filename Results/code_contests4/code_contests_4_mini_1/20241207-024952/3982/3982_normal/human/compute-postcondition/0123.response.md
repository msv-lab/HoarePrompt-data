According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at most 250000, and `ans` is 250000. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 250001, and `ans` must be at least 250001.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with `avail[i]` set to 0, `ans` must be at least 250001, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`**
