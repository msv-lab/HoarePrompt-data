The code snippet `psum += ax` indicates that the variable `psum` is being incremented by the value of `ax`. However, the initial values of `psum` and `ax` are not specified in the initial state. 

Given that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `n`, it does not directly impact `psum` or `ax`. The initial conditions mention that `x` and `y` are assigned values based on `rel_lights_x[n-1]` and `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, but these variables do not affect `psum` or `ax` either.

Since `avail` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute, we can assume that the loop is indeed executed, but without specific values for `psum` and `ax`, we cannot determine their exact values after the operation.

Thus, the output will reflect the fact that `psum` is incremented by `ax`, without specifying the exact numeric values.

Output State: **`psum` is incremented by `ax`**
