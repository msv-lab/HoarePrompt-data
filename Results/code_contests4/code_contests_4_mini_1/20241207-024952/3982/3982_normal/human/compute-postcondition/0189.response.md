The variable `ep` is assigned the value of `min(ans, x)`. The value of `ans` is known to be greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[ans + 1]`. Since both variables are used in the `min` function, the actual values of `ans` and `x` will determine the value of `ep`. The state of the other variables (`i`, `y`, and `sp`) is not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `ans + 1`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[ans + 1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is either `-y + ans` or `0`, and `ep` is the minimum of `ans` and `x`.**
