To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables:

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s, with one specific index set to -1, `ans` is 500000, and `x` and `y` are assigned values from `rel_lights_x[1]` and `rel_lights_y[1]` respectively.

2. The code snippet calculates `sp` using the formula `sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`.

3. We can simplify the expression within `max()`:
   - The term `x + y - ans` needs to be evaluated first. We don't have specific values for `x` and `y`, so we will keep them as they are.
   - Thus, `sp = max(0, x - (x + y - 500000))`.
   - This further simplifies to `sp = max(0, x - x - y + 500000)`, which results in `sp = max(0, 500000 - y)`.

4. The output state is contingent on the value of `sp`, which is dependent on the unknown value of `y`. Since `y` is not specified, we can only express `sp` in terms of `y`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship established through the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s except for index `ep + 1` which is -1, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[1]`, `sp` is max(0, 500000 - y)**.
