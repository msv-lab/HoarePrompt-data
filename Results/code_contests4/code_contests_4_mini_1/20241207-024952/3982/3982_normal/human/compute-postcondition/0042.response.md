According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. The loop iterates over each tuple in `lights`. Since `lights` contains at least `k` tuples, the loop can execute if `k` is at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `lx` and `ly` will represent the coordinates from the first tuple in the `lights` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `lights` contains at least one tuple and that `lx` and `ly` are the first elements of that tuple.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000, `lights` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `lx` is the first element of the first tuple in `lights`, `ly` is the second element of the first tuple in `lights`**
