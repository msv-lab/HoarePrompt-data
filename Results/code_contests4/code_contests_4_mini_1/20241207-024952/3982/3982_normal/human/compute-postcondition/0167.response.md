The value of `psum` is increased by `ax`. Since `ax` is the third element in `avail`, and `avail` contains at least 3 elements, `psum` will now hold a new value that is greater than its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `avail`, `ax`, `psum_min`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`; `avail` contains at least 3 elements; `ax` will be the third element in `avail`; `psum` is increased by `ax`; `psum_min` remains the minimum of its previous value and `psum`.
