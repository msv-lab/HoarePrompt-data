The code assigns the value `0` to `avail[i]`, where `i` is `250002`. Since `avail` is a list of size `1000002`, this index is within bounds. The value at `avail[250001]` is already set to `0`, but `avail[250002]` will also be set to `0`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, `avail` has `avail[250002]` set to 0, `ans` must be at least 250002, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250002, `avail` has `avail[250002]` set to 0, `ans` must be at least 250002, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]**
