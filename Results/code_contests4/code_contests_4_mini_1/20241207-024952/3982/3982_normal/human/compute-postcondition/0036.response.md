The code assigns the values `lx - rx` to `x` and `ly - ry` to `y`. The specific values of `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, and `ry` are not provided, but we know that `x` will be updated based on the difference between `lx` and `rx`, and `y` will be updated based on the difference between `ly` and `ry`. The conditions state that `x` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0 in order for `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` to include these values.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, or `ry`, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y` after this assignment. However, we can state that `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the calculations. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` have been assigned values based on their calculations.

Output State: **`x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`**.
