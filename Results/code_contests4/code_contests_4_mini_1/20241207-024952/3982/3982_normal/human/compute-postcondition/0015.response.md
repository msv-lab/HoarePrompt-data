The variable `rel_lights_y` is updated by appending the value of `y` to it. The previous state of `y` is calculated as `ly - ry`, where `ly` and `ry` are known from the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `lights`, `lx`, `ly`, `x`, and `rel_lights_x` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least two tuples; `lx` is the first element of the second tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the second tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` now has `x` appended to it; `rel_lights_y` now has `y` appended to it.**
