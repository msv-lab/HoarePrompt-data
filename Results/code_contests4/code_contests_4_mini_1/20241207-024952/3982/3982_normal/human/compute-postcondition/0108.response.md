The value of `psum` is incremented by `ax`. Since `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[1]`, the new value of `psum` becomes `avail[0] + avail[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1]`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1]`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[1]`**
