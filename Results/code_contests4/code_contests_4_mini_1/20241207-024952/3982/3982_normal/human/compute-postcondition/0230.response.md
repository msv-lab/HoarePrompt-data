Postcondition: ***`psum_min` is the minimum value of the cumulative sums of all elements in `avail`, `psum` is the total sum of all elements in `avail`, and `avail` is a list of elements that were iterated over. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`.***
