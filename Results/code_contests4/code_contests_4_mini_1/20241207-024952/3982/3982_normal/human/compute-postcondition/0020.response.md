The variable `y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`. The values of `n`, `m`, `lx`, `ly`, `x`, and `rel_lights_x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least three tuples; `lx` is the first element of the third tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the third tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` now contains `x` appended to it; `rel_lights_y` now contains `y` appended to it. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least three tuples; `lx` is the first element of the third tuple in `lights`; `ly` is the second element of the third tuple in `lights`; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`; `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` now contains `x` appended to it; `rel_lights_y` now contains `y` appended to it.**
