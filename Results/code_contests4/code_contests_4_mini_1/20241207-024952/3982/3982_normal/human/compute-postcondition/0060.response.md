The value of `n` is assigned the value `len(rel_lights_x)`, which is the length of the list `rel_lights_x`. Since `rel_lights_x` contains all non-negative values and is derived from the tuples in `lights` based on the conditions involving `robbers`, `n` will be a non-negative integer that represents the count of those values. The previous values of `n` are not specified, but it will be updated to the length of `rel_lights_x`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` contains at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k` tuples; `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with non-negative values.**
