According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `ans + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `ans`, which is 500000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 500001. However, since the loop condition is `i in range(ans + 1)`, it can only execute when `i` is less than or equal to `ans`. Thus, `i` must be 500001 for the loop to execute one more time, which is outside the specified range.

State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `lights` contains at least `k` tuples, `robbers` contains at least `k` tuples, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with non-negative values, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s, `ans` is 500000, `avail[0]` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 500001**
