According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `robbers` list. If `robbers` contains more tuples, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `lights` has at least `k` tuples, but we need to focus on the `robbers` list to determine if it contains enough tuples for another iteration. 

Given that `rx` and `ry` represent the elements of the current tuple in `robbers`, the next iteration will involve the next tuple in the list. Therefore, if the loop has executed for `k` tuples in `robbers`, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must contain at least `k + 1` tuples, and the current `rx` and `ry` will represent the next tuple in the list.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k` tuples, for the loop to execute one more time `robbers` must contain at least `k + 1` tuples, and `(rx, ry)` will be the next tuple in `robbers`.**
