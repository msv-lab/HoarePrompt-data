The variable `psum` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not change any other variables and only affects the value of `psum`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `avail`, and `psum_min` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, each element of `avail` has been updated according to the loop logic, `psum_min` is assigned the value of INF, and `psum` is 0.**
