To analyze the provided code snippet, we first note the values of the variables involved in the operation.

- `l` is given as 0.
- `r` is given as 1000001.

Now we perform the calculation indicated in the code snippet:

```
ans = l + (r - l) // 2
```

Breaking this down:
1. Calculate `r - l`: 
   - `r - l` equals `1000001 - 0`, which is `1000001`.
   
2. Calculate `(r - l) // 2`: 
   - `1000001 // 2` equals `500000` (integer division).

3. Finally, calculate `ans`:
   - `ans = 0 + 500000`, which results in `500000`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` contains at least `k` tuples; `robbers` contains at least `k` tuples; `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with non-negative values; `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001; `avail` is a list of size 1000002 filled with 0s; `ans` is 500000.**
