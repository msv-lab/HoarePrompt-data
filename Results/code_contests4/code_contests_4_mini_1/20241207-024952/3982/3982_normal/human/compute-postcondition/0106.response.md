The `psum_min` variable is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value of `psum`. Since `psum_min` is initialized to `INF` and `psum` is equal to `avail[0]`, `psum_min` will be updated to `psum` if `psum` is less than `INF`. Therefore, after this line executes, `psum_min` will be equal to `avail[0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, `psum` is `avail[0]`, `ax` is `avail[0]`.**
