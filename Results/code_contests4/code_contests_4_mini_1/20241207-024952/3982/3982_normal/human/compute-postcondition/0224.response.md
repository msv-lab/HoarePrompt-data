The variable `psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and the current value of `psum`. The variable `psum` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `ax`, but the code snippet provided only involves the reassignment of `psum_min`. Since we do not have specific previous values for `psum_min` and `psum`, we cannot determine their exact values. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `psum_min` based on the minimum calculation. 

Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum of its previous value and `psum`**
