The variable `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1. The previous state shows that `ep` is assigned the value `min(ans, x)`, but the exact value of `ep` is not provided in the initial state. However, it is known that `ep` is derived from `ans` and `x`, which are not specified. The adjustment of `avail[ep + 1]` does not affect the other variables (`n`, `i`, `sp`, `ep`, or `avail`), but we note that `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `sp` is max(0, ans - y) where `x` is rel_lights_x[2] and `y` is rel_lights_y[2]; `ep` is assigned the value min(ans, x); `avail[ep + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
