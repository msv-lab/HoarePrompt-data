`y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, where `i` is 250001. Since `n` is greater than 0 and does not affect the assignment, the value of `y` will be determined by the value of `rel_lights_y[250001]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250001]`, and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250001]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 250001, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[250001]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[250001]`**
