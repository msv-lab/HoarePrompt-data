The variable `rel_lights_y` is a list that will have the value of `y` appended to it. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `lights`, `lx`, `ly`, `x`, and `rel_lights_x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `y` has been added to `rel_lights_y`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000; `lights` is a list containing at least `k + 1` tuples; `lx` and `ly` are the next tuple in the list; `x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`; `rel_lights_x` includes the value `x`; `rel_lights_y` now includes the value `y`.**
