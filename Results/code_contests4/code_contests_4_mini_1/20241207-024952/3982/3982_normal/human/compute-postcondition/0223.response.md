`psum` is updated by adding `ax` to its previous value. The value of `psum_min` remains the minimum of its previous value and the updated `psum`. Since the actual values of `psum` and `ax` are not provided, we cannot calculate their exact values but can describe their relationship. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is the minimum of its previous value and the new `psum`; `psum` is updated to its previous value plus `ax`.

Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum of its previous value and the new `psum`; `psum` is updated to its previous value plus `ax`.**
