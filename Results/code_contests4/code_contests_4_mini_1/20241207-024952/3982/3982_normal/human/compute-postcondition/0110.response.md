According to the code, the loop iterates over the `avail` list. Since the end of the previous iteration has `i` equal to `n`, and given that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is not used directly in the loop but will impact the index if needed. The `avail` list has a size of 1000002, so it contains 1000002 elements, indexed from 0 to 1000001.

At the end of the last iteration, `ax` was assigned the value of `avail[1]`, meaning that the loop executed for `ax` equal to `avail[1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ax` must be assigned the next element in the `avail` list, which is `avail[2]`. 

Thus, after this iteration, `ax` would be `avail[2]`, and for the loop to execute again, the `avail` list must have at least 3 elements, which it does since its size is 1000002.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list of size 1000002, `ans` is 500000, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `psum_min` is `avail[0]`, `psum` is `avail[0] + avail[1]`, `ax` is assigned the value of `avail[2]`, and `psum_min` remains `avail[0]`.**
