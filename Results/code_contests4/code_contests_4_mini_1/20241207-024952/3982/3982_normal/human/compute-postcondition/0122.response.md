The value at the index `i` of the list `avail` is being set to 0. The initial state specifies that `i` is at most 250000, so the assignment of `avail[i] = 0` will affect the list at that particular index. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at most 250000, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with `avail[i]` set to 0, `ans` is 250000, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is at most 250000, `avail` is a list of size 1000002 with `avail[i]` set to 0, `ans` is 250000, `psum_min` is equal to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 500000, `x` assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]**
