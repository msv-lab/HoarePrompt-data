To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we first need to analyze it in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the minimum positive value of `x` such that the point `(a, b)` lies on the specified polyline. If no such `x` exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b) = map(float, raw_input().split())
if a < b:
    print - 1
    exit(0)
print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. **Initial Condition**: If `a < b`, the program correctly outputs `-1`, because for the polyline defined, `b` cannot be greater than `a` (the height cannot exceed the horizontal distance).
3. **Calculation of `x`**: The program computes `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))`. This attempts to find `x`, but we need to verify if this calculation is correct.

### Potential Issues:
- The calculation of `x` relies on the `math.floor` function, which can lead to incorrect results if `(a + b) / (2 * b)` is not an integer. Specifically, when `a + b` is not evenly divisible by `2 * b`, the program may end up calculating an incorrect `x`.
- The result of `x` needs to be positive. If the computed value is not valid for the given conditions, it should return `-1`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `(2, 1)`:
- `a = 2`, `b = 1`. Here, `a` is not less than `b`, so the program proceeds to compute `x`.
- `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))` translates to `(2 + 1) / (2 * math.floor((2 + 1) / (2 * 1)))` which becomes `3 / (2 * math.floor(3/2)) = 3 / (2 * 1) = 3 / 2 = 1.5`.
- The expected output for this case is `1.5`, which is actually correct.
  
However, if we consider the case `(3, 1)`:
- This will correctly return `1.0`, which is also fine.
  
Finally, consider `(1, 1)`:
- This calculates `x` correctly but we need to ensure the program checks all edge cases properly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle cases where the calculation of `x` does not yield a valid polyline point. For instance, if `b` is much less than `a`, the calculation of `x` does not ensure that it is positive under all conditions.

Thus, there are cases (like `(1, 3)` or cases where `a + b` is not divisible by `2 * b`) where the program may not return the correct results.

Correctness: **False**.
