To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The problem states that we need to find a minimum positive value \( x \) such that the point \( (a, b) \) lies on a polyline defined by the coordinates:

- (0, 0)
- (x, x)
- (2x, 0)
- (3x, x)
- (4x, 0)
- ...

The points alternate between \( (nx, 0) \) for even \( n \) and \( (nx, x) \) for odd \( n \). 

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code reads two floating-point numbers, \( a \) and \( b \).
  
2. **Condition Check**: 
   - The program checks if \( a < b \). If true, it immediately prints `-1` and exits. This condition is not sufficient to determine if \( (a, b) \) is on the polyline. For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), it would incorrectly output -1 even though valid x might exist.

3. **Calculation**: 
   - The formula used is:
     ```python
     print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
     ```
   - This formula seems to attempt to find a value of \( x \) based on a combination of \( a \) and \( b \). However, it does not correctly compute \( x \) according to the polyline's structure as described in the problem.

### Key Issues
1. The check for \( a < b \) is not sufficient to determine if there is no valid \( x \). For example, if \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 1 \), \( x \) can still be determined.
2. The formula used does not appear to correctly derive a positive \( x \) that guarantees \( (a, b) \) lies on the polyline. The calculations should involve ensuring the point lies on the segments defined by alternating heights of \( x \) and 0, which is not captured by the current logic.

### Test Cases
- **Case 1**: Input `3 1`
  - Expected output: `1.000000000000`
  - The program should return this correctly.
  
- **Case 2**: Input `1 3`
  - Expected output: `-1`
  - The program should return this correctly.

- **Case 3**: Input `4 1`
  - Expected output: `1.250000000000`
  - The program should return this correctly.

- **Counterexample**: Input `2 1`
  - The program outputs a result, but the logic is flawed, and it doesn't guarantee \( x \) is valid. The actual calculations would reveal that there is a valid \( x \) but not derived correctly by the program.

### Conclusion
Because the program fails to correctly handle various inputs and contains logical flaws that prevent it from accurately determining the existence of a valid \( x \), I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
