The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` by reading from input and converting them to floats. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers, but after this line of code, they will be converted to floats. Therefore, the impact of the code is that `a` and `b` will now hold float values derived from the input. The specific values of `a` and `b` are not known, as they depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are now floats derived from input**.
