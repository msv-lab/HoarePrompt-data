Given that `a` is a float and `b` is a float derived from input, and if `a` is less than `b`, the program exits without further processing, we need to analyze the provided code snippet.

The code snippet is:
```
print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
```

Since the condition states that if `a` is less than `b`, the program exits without further processing, we do not execute the line of code provided. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that no calculation occurred due to the initial condition.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are floats derived from input; program exits without further processing.**
