Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` from user input. If `a` is less than `b`, it outputs `-1` and exits the program. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the result of the expression `(a + b) / (2 * floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))`. The function does not handle cases where the input might be non-integer or if the division results in errors, such as division by zero, since it relies on valid input as per the specified constraints. **
