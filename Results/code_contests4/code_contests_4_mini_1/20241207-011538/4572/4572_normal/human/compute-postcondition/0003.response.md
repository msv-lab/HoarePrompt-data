The `exit(0)` command is invoked, which terminates the program immediately. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and no further execution occurs after this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are floats derived from input; `a` is less than `b`; the output is -1, and the program exits without further processing.
