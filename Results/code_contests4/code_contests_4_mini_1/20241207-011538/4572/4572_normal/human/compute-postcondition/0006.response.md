The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the output is determined based on the values of `a` and `b`. Since no specific output cases are provided, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers constrained between 1 and 10^9.**
