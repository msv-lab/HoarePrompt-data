Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum positive value of `x` such that the polyline passes through the point `(a, b)` as described in the problem statement. 

Here are the issues with the implementation:

1. **Invalid Input Handling**: The program checks if `a < b` and returns `-1` immediately. This check is not sufficient as per the problem requirements. The polyline can still pass through points where `a < b`. The logic should consider the structure of the polyline rather than simply comparing `a` and `b`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The formula used in the print statement:
   ```python
   print(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))
   ```
   does not represent the calculation needed to find the minimum `x`. The relationship between `a`, `b`, and `x` is not accurately captured. The problem requires a careful analysis of the polyline structure and how `x` can be derived from `a` and `b`, which this formula does not do.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted to a specific precision (12 decimal places), but this is not accounted for in the print statement.

4. **Mathematical Logic**: The logic to determine if there is a valid `x` such that the polyline passes through `(a, b)` is not implemented. The conditions under which `x` should be derived from `a` and `b` are not coded into the program.

In summary, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements as it does not correctly compute or check the necessary conditions for `x`.
