The function reads an integer from standard input, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. However, the function does not enforce any constraints on the value of this integer, meaning it could technically return any integer value that is input, not limited to the specified ranges of 1 to 10^5 for `n` and 0 to 10^9 for each element in list `a`.
