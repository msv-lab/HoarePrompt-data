The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input containing space-separated integers. It returns a map object where each integer is converted from the input string to an integer type. The integers are expected to be non-negative and must satisfy the condition 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Note that the function does not validate the input, so if the input does not meet these criteria, it may result in unexpected behavior.
