You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input, which is expected to be a non-negative integer within the specified range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from standard input, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. However, the function does not enforce any constraints on the value of this integer, meaning it could technically return any integer value that is input, not limited to the specified ranges of 1 to 10^5 for `n` and 0 to 10^9 for each element in list `a`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing n non-negative integers from the input, where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input containing space-separated integers. It returns a map object where each integer is converted from the input string to an integer type. The integers are expected to be non-negative and must satisfy the condition 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Note that the function does not validate the input, so if the input does not meet these criteria, it may result in unexpected behavior.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000000000.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, with any trailing whitespace removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a line of input read from standard input with any trailing whitespace removed. The function does not handle potential input errors or unexpected input formats, as it assumes valid input will always be provided within the specified constraints.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers; `s` is the last integer in `args`; the output is the string representation of all integers in `args` followed by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `args` containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) followed by `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000,000). It outputs all integers in `args` as a space-separated string followed by a newline. The function does not return any value; it only prints the output to standard output.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing exactly two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and the second element is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a.
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing exactly two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second element is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `s` takes on the values of `n` and the list of integers in sequential order, and all elements are output as their string representations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing exactly two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It outputs the string representations of both the integer `n` and the list of integers sequentially. However, it does not return any value or result based on the input array, as it only writes to the standard output.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
