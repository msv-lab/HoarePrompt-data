Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully implement the logic required to find the subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean as described in the problem statement. The functions provided primarily handle input and output without any logic to calculate the arithmetic mean or to determine the longest subsegment that achieves this mean.

Specifically, the absence of a function to compute the maximum arithmetic mean and the corresponding longest subsegment is a critical flaw. For instance, given the example input:

```
5
6 1 6 6 0
```

The expected output is `2`, representing the length of the longest subsegment `[3, 4]`, which has the maximum arithmetic mean of `6`. However, there is no code that analyzes the array to find such a subsegment.

Thus, because the program lacks the necessary logic to fulfill the requirements of the problem statement, it fails to cover all potential cases where the arithmetic mean needs to be calculated and the longest subsegment identified. This leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
