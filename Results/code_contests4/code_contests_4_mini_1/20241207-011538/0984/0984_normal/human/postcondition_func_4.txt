The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing exactly two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It outputs the string representations of both the integer `n` and the list of integers sequentially. However, it does not return any value or result based on the input array, as it only writes to the standard output.
