Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `args` containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) followed by `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000,000). It outputs all integers in `args` as a space-separated string followed by a newline. The function does not return any value; it only prints the output to standard output. **
