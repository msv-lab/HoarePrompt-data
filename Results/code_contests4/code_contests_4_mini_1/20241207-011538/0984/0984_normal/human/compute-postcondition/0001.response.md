Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing exactly two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second element is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); on the first iteration `s` is `n`, on the second iteration `s` is the list of `n` integers; `sys.stdout.write` outputs the string representation of `s`.**
