The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `args`, which is a variable-length argument list containing exactly two elements. The first element is an integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, representing the length of the array. The second element is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`, representing the array `a`. The function processes this input and produces a result based on the contents of the array. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter args, which contains an integer n and a list of n integers. It processes the array according to its defined logic and returns a result based on the input array.**
