Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing exactly two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second element is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `s` takes on the values of `n` and the list of integers in sequential order, and all elements are output as their string representations.**
