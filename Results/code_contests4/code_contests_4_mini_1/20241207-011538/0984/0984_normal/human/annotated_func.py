#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input, which is expected to be a non-negative integer within the specified range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from standard input, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. However, the function does not enforce any constraints on the value of this integer, meaning it could technically return any integer value that is input, not limited to the specified ranges of 1 to 10^5 for `n` and 0 to 10^9 for each element in list `a`.

def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing n non-negative integers from the input, where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input containing space-separated integers. It returns a map object where each integer is converted from the input string to an integer type. The integers are expected to be non-negative and must satisfy the condition 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Note that the function does not validate the input, so if the input does not meet these criteria, it may result in unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000000000.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a line of input read from standard input, with any trailing whitespace removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a line of input read from standard input with any trailing whitespace removed. The function does not handle potential input errors or unexpected input formats, as it assumes valid input will always be provided within the specified constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers; `s` is the last integer in `args`; the output is the string representation of all integers in `args` followed by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `args` containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) followed by `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000,000). It outputs all integers in `args` as a space-separated string followed by a newline. The function does not return any value; it only prints the output to standard output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing exactly two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and the second element is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a.
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing exactly two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second element is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `s` takes on the values of `n` and the list of integers in sequential order, and all elements are output as their string representations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing exactly two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It outputs the string representations of both the integer `n` and the list of integers sequentially. However, it does not return any value or result based on the input array, as it only writes to the standard output.
