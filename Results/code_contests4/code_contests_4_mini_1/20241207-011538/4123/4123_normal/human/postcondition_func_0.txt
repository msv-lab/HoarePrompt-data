The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` is between 0 and `n` and `y` is between 0 and `n`, with `n` being a positive integer between 1 and 1000. It returns `x` if `y` is 0, `y + n` if `x` is equal to `n`, `n - x + 3n` if `y` is equal to `n`, and `3n - y` in all other cases, where `y` is greater than 0 and less than `n`. The function does not handle cases where `y` is equal to 0 and `x` is equal to `n` simultaneously, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
