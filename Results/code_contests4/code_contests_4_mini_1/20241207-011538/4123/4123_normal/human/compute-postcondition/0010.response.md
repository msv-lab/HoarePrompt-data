The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. The parameter `y` is a non-negative integer that is greater than 0. 

The function has multiple return cases based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `n`:

- Case 1: If the conditions are met, the function returns the value of `x`.
- Case 2: If the conditions are met, the function returns the value of `y` added to the value of `n`.
- Case 3: If the conditions are met, the function returns the calculated value as `n - x + 3n`.
- Case 4: If the conditions are met, the function returns the value of `3n - y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `x` and `y`, and based on their values and the value of `n`, it returns different outputs according to the specified cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`, and returns different values based on the specified cases involving `x`, `y`, and `n`.**
