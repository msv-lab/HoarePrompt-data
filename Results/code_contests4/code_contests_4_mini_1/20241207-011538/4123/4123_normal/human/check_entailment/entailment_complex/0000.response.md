The provided program is intended to calculate the shortest distance between two points located on the sides of a square, as outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze the program to determine its correctness.

1. **Function Behavior**: The function `func_1(x, y)` is designed to evaluate the coordinates of a single point on the square. The function returns different values based on the conditions of `y` and `x`. However, it does not appear to consider the relationship between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` as required by the problem description.

2. **Handling Two Points**: The problem requires calculating the distance between two points on the sides of the square, taking into account that the path must go through the sides. The program does not implement any logic to compute the distance between two distinct points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. Instead, it only evaluates one set of coordinates `(x, y)` at a time.

3. **Path Calculation**: The conditions used in the function (checking `y`, `x`, and their comparisons to `n`) do not accurately capture the shortest path around the square between the two points. For example, the function does not consider the wrapping around the corners of the square or calculate the total distance correctly based on the position of both points.

4. **Examples Validation**: 
   - For the input `2 0 0 1 0`, the expected output is `1`, which correctly represents the distance between the two points. However, this is not validated by the program as it only handles one point.
   - For `2 0 1 2 1`, the expected output is `4`, but again, there is no logic in the program to calculate the distance between these two specific coordinates.
   - For `100 0 0 100 100`, the expected output is `200`, which indicates a distance that involves multiple segments of movement along the square's perimeterâ€”this is not computed by the function.

In summary, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description because it only focuses on one point and lacks the necessary logic to calculate distances between two points on the square's perimeter. Thus, it cannot provide the correct distance for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
