Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square as described in the problem statement. 

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` only handles the cases based on the coordinates of a single point `(x, y)`. It does not take into account the second point `(x2, y2)` or how the two points relate to each other to compute the distance correctly.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The logic used to calculate distances is incorrect. The program does not implement the necessary checks and calculations to find the shortest path around the edge of the square. For example, the shortest path between two points could involve moving around the corners of the square, which the current implementation does not address.

3. **Missing Input Processing**: The program lacks the necessary structure to take inputs as described in the problem (specifically, it does not read or handle `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`), which are needed to compute the required distance.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
2 0 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `4`, as the shortest path around the square would move from `(0, 1)` to `(2, 1)`, which travels a total distance of `4`. The current implementation does not produce this result and fails to consider how to navigate the edges of the square.

In conclusion, the program does not satisfy the requirements set by the problem description, which necessitates a more comprehensive approach to calculate the shortest distance between two points on the perimeter of the square.
