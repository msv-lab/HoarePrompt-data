The provided program aims to calculate the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square based on their coordinates. Let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Code Analysis
1. The program takes five input integers: `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, which represent the side length of the square and the coordinates of two points on the square's perimeter.
2. It defines a function `func_1(x, y)` to transform point coordinates into a linear representation along the perimeter of the square.
3. The function has specific return values based on the coordinates:
   - Returns `x` if `y == 0` (the bottom edge).
   - Returns `y + n` if `x == n` (the right edge).
   - Returns `n - x + 3n` if `y == n` (the top edge).
   - Returns `3n - y` for all other cases.

The calculation `print(func_1(x2, y2) - func_1(x1, y1) + 4 * n) % (4 * n)` aims to find the difference in the linear representation of the two points, adjusted by the perimeter.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. The function does not explicitly handle the case where both points are at the same corner of the square (e.g., (0, 0) and (0, 0)). This could lead to incorrect distance calculations since the difference would be zero, but the distance should be defined.
2. The output hints mention that the function does not handle the simultaneous condition where `y == 0` and `x == n`. Although this case should not occur based on the problem constraints (points lie on the sides), if it were to happen, the output might be incorrect.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints provide a breakdown of what the function does for various inputs. They are consistent with the code, as they describe the return values for different coordinate scenarios. However, they also point out that the case where `y == 0` and `x == n` is not handled, which could indeed lead to unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion
The program is expected to calculate the shortest distance correctly for most cases. However, the potential edge cases highlighted, particularly the unhandled scenario of two corners being equal and the simultaneous case of `y == 0` and `x == n`, indicate that the program does not fully meet the problem description requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
