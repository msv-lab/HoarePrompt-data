To determine the correctness of the provided program that calculates the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square, we need to analyze the logic.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads five integers, which represent the side length of the square and the coordinates of the two points on the square's perimeter.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The function `func_1` computes a distance based on the coordinates of the points. However, the logic used to calculate this distance appears to be complicated and may not correctly account for all configurations of points on the square.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - When both points are at the same position (e.g., (0,0) and (0,0)), the distance should be `0`, but we need to check if this case returns the right result.
   - When points are at opposite corners of the square (e.g., (0,0) and (n,n)), the distance should be `2n` since they could go around the square.
   - When points are on the same side (e.g., (0,0) and (1,0)), the distance should simply be the absolute difference between their x-coordinates.

4. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` does not seem to correctly handle all possible cases. For instance:
   - If `x1 = 0`, `y1 = 0`, `x2 = n`, `y2 = n`, it should yield a distance of `2n`, but the calculation may not yield this depending on the inner logic.
   - The modulo operation with `(4 * n)` seems to imply a circular path around the square, which may not be necessary depending on the input coordinates.

Given these observations, we can construct a test case where the result is not as expected. 

For the input:
```
2 0 0 2 2
```
This represents the points (0,0) and (2,2). The expected output should be `4` (the distance going around the sides), but the logic in the function may not yield this.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
