To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it correctly calculates the shortest distance between two points on the sides of a square.

The program reads five integers: `n` (the side length of the square), and the coordinates of two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` which are guaranteed to lie on the sides of the square.

The function `func_1(x, y)` is defined to compute a value based on the position of the point `(x, y)` on the square's perimeter. The logic inside this function seems to map the coordinates on the square's sides to a linear representation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function works:

1. If the point is on the bottom side (y = 0), the distance from the origin is simply `x`.
2. If the point is on the right side (x = n), the distance is `y + n`, which accounts for moving vertically up from the bottom right corner.
3. If the point is on the top side (y = n), the distance is calculated by moving from the left corner (0, n) to (n, n), which is `n - x + n + n`.
4. Lastly, if the point is on the left side (x = 0), the distance is `n - y + n + n + n`, which seems to account for moving around the square to reach the left side from the bottom left corner.

The program computes the distance between the two points as:

```python
print(func_1(x2, y2) - func_1(x1, y1) + 4 * n) % (4 * n)
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Distance Calculation**: The program might not correctly account for the circular nature of the square's perimeter. For example, if `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides of the square, the direct linear distance may not be correct. The code should consider the shorter path around the square, which might not be correctly handled by simply using `func_1`.
  
2. **Modulo Operation**: The addition of `4 * n` and subsequent modulo operation could lead to incorrect results if the calculated distance is negative or if it misrepresents the intended distance.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `n = 2`, `(x1, y1) = (0, 1)`, and `(x2, y2) = (2, 0)`. The shortest distance should be 3 (going from (0, 1) down to (0, 0), then to (2, 0)). 

Using the function:
- For `(0, 1)`: it would return 2 (since it would process as moving to the left side and counting).
- For `(2, 0)`: it would return 0 (directly at the bottom right).

Hence, the output would be computed as `0 - 2 + 8`, which is `6 % 8 = 6`, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
