The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `t` is `m - 2`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `t` becomes `m - 3`. Other variables' states are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is at least 3; `a` is a list of integers decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c[a[0]]` is incremented by 1; `l` is 0; `r` is increased by 1; `ans` is -1; `t` is `m - 3; `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**
