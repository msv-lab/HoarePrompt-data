The value of `r` is incremented by 1, which means that `r` is now one unit larger than its previous value. The states of the other variables, including `ans`, `l`, and `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` has been updated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is now one unit larger, and the conditions for the loop to execute again are still valid.

Output State: **`ans` has been updated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is now one unit larger, and the conditions for the loop to execute again are still valid.**
