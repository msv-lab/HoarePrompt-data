The value of `t` is assigned the value of `m`. Since `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `t` will also hold a value within the same range. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros; `l` is 0; `r` is -1; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros; `l` is 0; `r` is -1; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m.**
