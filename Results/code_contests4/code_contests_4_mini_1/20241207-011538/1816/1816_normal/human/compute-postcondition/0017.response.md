The value of `t` is decremented by 1, and since `t` is equal to `m - 1`, its new value will be `m - 2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c[a[0]]` is incremented by 1; `l` is 0; `r` is now greater than its previous value; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m - 2; `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c[a[0]]` is incremented by 1; `l` is 0; `r` is now greater than its previous value; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m - 2; `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**
