The variable `a` is assigned the result of applying a lambda function to each element of the list generated by splitting the input string from `raw_input()`. Each element in this list is converted to an integer and then decremented by 1. The specific values of `n` and `m` do not affect this operation directly, as they are not modified by it. The output state will depend on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which we cannot specify here. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1.**
