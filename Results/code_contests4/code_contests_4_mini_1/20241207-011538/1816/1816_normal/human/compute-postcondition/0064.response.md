According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has been incremented by 1, and `r` is equal to the maximum value it can take such that `r + 1` is less than `n`. 

Since `l` has been incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, which means `l` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is still less than or equal to `r`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be equal to `r` or less than `r`. This means that `r` needs to remain greater than or equal to the new value of `l`.

State: **`r` is equal to the maximum value it can take such that `r + 1` is less than `n`; `c[a[l]]` is equal to `b[a[l]]`; `l` is incremented by 1; `c[a[r]]` is incremented as needed during the iterations; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `r - l + 1 - s,` and for the loop to execute again `l` must be less than or equal to `r`**
