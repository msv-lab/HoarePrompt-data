The variables `l` and `r` are initialized with the values `0` and `-1`, respectively. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment; instead, they are simply set. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `c`) remain unaffected as they are not involved in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros; `l` is 0; `r` is -1.
