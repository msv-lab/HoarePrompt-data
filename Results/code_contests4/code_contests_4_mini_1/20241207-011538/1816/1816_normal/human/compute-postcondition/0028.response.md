Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` contains the counts of each integer in `a` up to `m`; `l` is 0; `r` is equal to `n - 1`; `ans` is -1; `t` is greater than 0, indicating that all required counts have been met, the value of `ans` is printed, and the program is exiting.***
