The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is equal to the maximum value it can take such that `r + 1` is less than `n`, `c[a[l]]` is equal to `b[a[l]]`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `c[a[r]]` is incremented as needed during the iterations, and `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
