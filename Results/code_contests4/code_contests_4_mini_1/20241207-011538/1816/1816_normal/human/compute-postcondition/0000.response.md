The line of code `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts those parts into integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The input will assign values to `n` and `m`, which will now hold specific integer values.

Since the values of `n` and `m` are determined by user input and we have no specific values provided, we cannot state the exact integers they will hold after execution. However, we can conclude that they will be integers within the specified ranges.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n**
