The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Since `r` is equal to the maximum value it can take such that `r + 1` is less than `n`, after the execution, `r` will now be greater than or equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`r` is now greater than or equal to `n`**
