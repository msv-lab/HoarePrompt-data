Postcondition: ***`r` is the largest index such that `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, `c[a[r]]` has been incremented for each iteration of the loop, `l` is still 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1, `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`, `c` contains the counts of each integer in `a` up to `m` with `c[a[l]]` decremented by 1, `ans` is equal to n - s, `t` is greater than 0, and `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`.***
