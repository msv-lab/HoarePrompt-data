The code `c[a[r]] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[r]` of the array `c` by 1. Given that `r` is less than `n - 1`, `a[r]` is a valid index. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now increased by 1, `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, and `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`r` is now increased by 1, `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, and `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**
