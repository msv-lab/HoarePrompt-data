Postcondition: ***`r` is equal to `n - 1`, `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, and `c[a[r]]` is incremented as needed during the iterations. The condition `c[a[l]]` is still less than `b[a[l]]` holds true. The loop will terminate when either `r + 1` is not less than `n` or `c[a[l]]` is no longer less than `b[a[l]]`.***
