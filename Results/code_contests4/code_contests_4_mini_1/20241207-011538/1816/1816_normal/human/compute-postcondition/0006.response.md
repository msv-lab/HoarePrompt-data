The variable `ans` is assigned the value of -1. This assignment does not change the values of any other variables in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` is a list of length `m` initialized with zeros; `l` is 0; `r` is -1; `ans` is -1.
