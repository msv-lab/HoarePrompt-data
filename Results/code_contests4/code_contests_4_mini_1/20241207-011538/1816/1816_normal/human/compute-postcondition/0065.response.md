Output State: **`r` is equal to the maximum value it can take such that `r + 1` is less than `n`; `c[a[l]]` is updated to `c[a[l]] - 1`; `l` is incremented by 1; `c[a[r]]` is incremented as needed during the iterations; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `r - l + 1 - s;` the loop continues with `l` less than or equal to `r.**
