Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` now has `c[a[0]]` incremented by 1; `l` is 0; `r` is 0; `ans` is -1; `t` is equal to `m`; and `c[a[r]]` is equal to `b[a[r]]`.***
