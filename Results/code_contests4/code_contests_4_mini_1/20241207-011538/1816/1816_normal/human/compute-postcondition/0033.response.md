The value of `r` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `r` is unknown, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` contains the counts of each integer in `a` up to `m` with `c[a[l]]` decremented by 1; `l` is 0; `r` is increased by 1; `ans` is equal to n - s; `t` is greater than 0; for the loop to execute the first time `c[a[l]]` must be less than `b[a[l]]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, each decremented by 1; `s` is the sum of the integers in `b`; `c` contains the counts of each integer in `a` up to `m` with `c[a[l]]` decremented by 1; `l` is 0; `r` is increased by 1; `ans` is equal to n - s; `t` is greater than 0; for the loop to execute the first time `c[a[l]]` must be less than `b[a[l]]`.**
