The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Since it was stated that `r` is now less than `n - 1`, after the execution, `r` will still be less than `n - 1`, but its exact value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `r` has increased by 1 while the current state of `n` remains unknown.

Output State: **`r` is now less than `n - 1`, and `r` is increased by 1**
