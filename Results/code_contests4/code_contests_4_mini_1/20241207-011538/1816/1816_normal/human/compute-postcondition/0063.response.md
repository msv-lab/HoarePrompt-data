Output State: **`r` is equal to the maximum value it can take such that `r + 1` is less than `n`; `c[a[l]]` is equal to `b[a[l]]`; `l` is incremented by 1; `c[a[r]]` is incremented as needed during the iterations; if `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `r - l + 1 - s`.**
