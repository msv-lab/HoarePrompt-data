The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `r` was increased by 1 before executing this code snippet, making the new value of `r` equal to its previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `r + 2` for the loop to execute again, `n` is greater than `r + 1`, `c[a[l]]` is increased by 1, and `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`.

Output State: **`r` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `r + 2 for the loop to execute again, n is greater than r + 1, c[a[l]] is increased by 1, and c[a[l]] is less than b[a[l]]**
