#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` (the number of lightsabers) and `m` (the number of different colors), along with two lists: one containing `n` integers that represent the colors of the lightsabers and another containing `m` integers that specify the desired counts of Jedi Knights for each color. It calculates and returns the minimum number of lightsabers required to meet the desired counts of each color. If it is not possible to meet all desired counts, it returns -1.
