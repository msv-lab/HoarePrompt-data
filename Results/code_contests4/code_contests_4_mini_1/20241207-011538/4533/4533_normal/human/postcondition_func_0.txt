The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which indicates the number of heights in a list `h`, and processes this list to calculate a new list `s`. The list `s` contains the difference between the current maximum height observed and each height in the list, adjusted to ensure that negative values are replaced with zero. Finally, the function prints the values in `s` in the original order. The function does not return anything but outputs the result directly.
