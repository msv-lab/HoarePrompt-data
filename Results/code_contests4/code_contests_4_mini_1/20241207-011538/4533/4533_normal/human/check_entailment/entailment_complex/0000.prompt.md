You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The capital of Berland has n multifloor buildings. The architect who built up the capital was very creative, so all the houses were built in one row.

Let's enumerate all the houses from left to right, starting with one. A house is considered to be luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses with larger numbers. In other words, a house is luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses, which are located to the right from it. In this task it is assumed that the heights of floors in the houses are the same.

The new architect is interested in n questions, i-th of them is about the following: "how many floors should be added to the i-th house to make it luxurious?" (for all i from 1 to n, inclusive). You need to help him cope with this task.

Note that all these questions are independent from each other — the answer to the question for house i does not affect other answers (i.e., the floors to the houses are not actually added).

Input

The first line of the input contains a single number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of houses in the capital of Berland.

The second line contains n space-separated positive integers hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 109), where hi equals the number of floors in the i-th house. 

Output

Print n integers a1, a2, ..., an, where number ai is the number of floors that need to be added to the house number i to make it luxurious. If the house is already luxurious and nothing needs to be added to it, then ai should be equal to zero.

All houses are numbered from left to right, starting from one.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and h is a list of n positive integers where each integer hi satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.next())
    floors = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split(' '))
    m = 0
    s = []
    for h in floors[::-1]:
        s.append('%i' % (m - h + 1 if m - h + 1 > 0 else 0))
        
        m = max(h, m)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `m` is the maximum height from `floors`; `s` is a list containing `n` integers representing the results of the calculations performed during the iterations.
    print(' '.join(s[::-1]).strip())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which indicates the number of heights in a list `h`, and processes this list to calculate a new list `s`. The list `s` contains the difference between the current maximum height observed and each height in the list, adjusted to ensure that negative values are replaced with zero. Finally, the function prints the values in `s` in the original order. The function does not return anything but outputs the result directly.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
