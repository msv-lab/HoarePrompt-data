To determine whether the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze how the program processes the input and generates output based on the given conditions.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Identify how many floors need to be added to each house to make it "luxurious."
2. A house is considered luxurious if its number of floors is strictly greater than any house to its right.
3. The output should be a list of integers where each integer represents the number of floors to be added to each respective house.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `floors` representing the number of floors in each house.

2. **Reverse Processing**:
   - The program iterates through the list of floors in reverse order (from right to left). This is a valid approach because it allows us to keep track of the maximum height (`m`) encountered so far to the right of the current house.

3. **Logic for Calculating Floors to Add**:
   - For each house (starting from the rightmost one), the program checks if the current house's height `h` is less than or equal to `m`. 
   - If it is, it calculates how many floors need to be added (which would be `m - h + 1`, ensuring that it becomes strictly greater than `m`).
   - If the result is less than or equal to zero, it sets the required addition to zero (indicating the house is already luxurious).

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the results are collected in a list `s`, which is reversed back to the original order before printing.

### Verification against Requirements:
- **Luxurious Condition**: The program correctly identifies if a house is already luxurious or calculates the necessary floors to make it luxurious by comparing it with the maximum height of the houses to its right.
- **Independent Questions**: The program correctly computes each houseâ€™s requirement without affecting others, which aligns with the problem description.
- **Correct Output Format**: The output matches the required format of a single line of space-separated integers.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description as it accurately computes the necessary number of floors to be added to each house to ensure it becomes luxurious. It handles all edge cases as specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
