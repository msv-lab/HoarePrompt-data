To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we must analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code.

The loop iterates over the `floors` list in reverse order. For each floor height `h`, it appends a value to the list `s` that is calculated based on the current maximum `m` and the current floor height `h`. The value appended is `m - h + 1` if that result is positive, otherwise, it appends `0`. After appending, `m` is updated to be the maximum of the current `h` and the previous `m`.

After the loop finishes executing:
1. `n` remains unchanged as it is a parameter of the input.
2. `h` is not defined after the loop ends, as it is only used within the loop's scope.
3. `floors` remains unchanged as it is also a parameter of the input.
4. `m` will be the maximum value found in the `floors` list, as it keeps getting updated to the maximum height during the iterations.
5. `s` will contain a series of values calculated as described, reflecting the differences between `m` and the heights of the floors processed.

In the context where `floors` is non-empty and considering how the loop operates, `s` will contain `n` values, each representing the calculated difference or `0`.

Thus, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `m` is the maximum height from `floors`; `s` is a list containing `n` integers representing the results of the calculations performed during the iterations.**
