`m` is assigned the value `max(h, m)`. The previous value of `m` is 0, and `h` is a positive integer. Therefore, `m` will be updated to the greater of `h` or 0, which will be `h` since it is positive. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `h` is a positive integer; `floors` is a non-empty iterable of integers; `m` is `h`; `s` is either [1] if `h` is 1 or [0] if `h` ≥ 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `h` is a positive integer; `floors` is a non-empty iterable of integers; `m` is `h`; `s` is either [1] if `h` is 1 or [0] if `h` ≥ 2.**
