The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on two variables: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `h`, which is a list of `n` positive integers. The constraints specify that `n` must be in the range of 1 to 100,000, and each integer in the list `h` must be in the range of 1 to 1,000,000,000. The function's output is not explicitly stated, so we cannot determine specific return values without additional context. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality of the function based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a list h of n positive integers (1 ≤ hi ≤ 1,000,000,000).**
