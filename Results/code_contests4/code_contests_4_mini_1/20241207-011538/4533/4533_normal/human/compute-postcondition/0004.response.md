According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `floors` iterable. For the loop to execute, `floors` must contain at least one integer. At the start of the loop, `m` is 0 and `s` is an empty list. The variable `h` will take its first value from the last element of `floors` when the loop executes. 

So for the loop to be executed, `floors` must be non-empty, and `h` will be set to the last element of `floors`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `h` is a list of `n` positive integers; `floors` is a non-empty iterable of integers; `m` is 0; `s` is an empty list; for the loop to execute the first time `h` is the last element of `floors`.**
