To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have `n` buildings, each with a certain number of floors.
2. A building is considered luxurious if its floor count is strictly greater than all buildings to its right.
3. For each building, we need to determine how many additional floors are needed to make it luxurious. If it's already luxurious, the additional floors needed should be 0.

### Code Analysis:
```python
n = int(sys.stdin.next())
floors = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split(' '))
m = 0
s = []
for h in floors[::-1]:
    s.append('%i' % (m - h + 1 if m - h + 1 > 0 else 0))
    m = max(h, m)
print(' '.join(s[::-1]).strip())
```

1. The first line reads the number of buildings.
2. The second line reads the heights of the buildings into a list `floors`.
3. The code iterates over the heights in reverse order (right to left).
4. For each height `h`, it calculates how many floors need to be added to `h` to make it luxurious based on the maximum height `m` from the buildings to the right.
5. If the current building height `h` is already greater than or equal to `m`, then `0` is added to the result list.
6. Finally, the results are printed in the original order.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program calculates `m` (the maximum height of buildings to the right) correctly as it reverses the list.
2. However, the calculation for additional floors seems to be incorrect:
   - The code calculates `m - h + 1`, which is supposed to give the number of floors to be added. However, if `h` is equal to `m`, it incorrectly assigns `1` instead of `0`. This means it does not correctly handle the case where the current building is equal to the maximum height found so far.
3. Consider the input `4\n3 3 3 4`. According to the logic, the outputs should be `2 2 2 0`, but the program would produce `2 2 2 1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Since we found a case (e.g., when all buildings are at maximum height) where the program does not work as expected, the final assessment of the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.
