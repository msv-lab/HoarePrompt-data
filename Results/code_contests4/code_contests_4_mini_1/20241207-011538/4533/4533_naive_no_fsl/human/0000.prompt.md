You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The capital of Berland has n multifloor buildings. The architect who built up the capital was very creative, so all the houses were built in one row.

Let's enumerate all the houses from left to right, starting with one. A house is considered to be luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses with larger numbers. In other words, a house is luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses, which are located to the right from it. In this task it is assumed that the heights of floors in the houses are the same.

The new architect is interested in n questions, i-th of them is about the following: "how many floors should be added to the i-th house to make it luxurious?" (for all i from 1 to n, inclusive). You need to help him cope with this task.

Note that all these questions are independent from each other — the answer to the question for house i does not affect other answers (i.e., the floors to the houses are not actually added).

Input

The first line of the input contains a single number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of houses in the capital of Berland.

The second line contains n space-separated positive integers hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 109), where hi equals the number of floors in the i-th house. 

Output

Print n integers a1, a2, ..., an, where number ai is the number of floors that need to be added to the house number i to make it luxurious. If the house is already luxurious and nothing needs to be added to it, then ai should be equal to zero.

All houses are numbered from left to right, starting from one.

Examples

Input

5
1 2 3 1 2


Output

3 2 0 2 0 

Input

4
3 2 1 4


Output

2 3 4 0 
Program:
```
n = int(sys.stdin.next())
floors = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split(' '))
m = 0
s = []
for h in floors[::-1]:
    s.append('%i' % (m - h + 1 if m - h + 1 > 0 else 0))
    m = max(h, m)
print(' '.join(s[::-1]).strip())
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
