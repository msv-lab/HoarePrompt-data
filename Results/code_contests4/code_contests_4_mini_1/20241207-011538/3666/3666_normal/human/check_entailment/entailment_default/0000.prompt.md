You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts an integer `q` (which represents the number of segments) from user input and returns this integer. The function does not, however, handle or return the subsequent inputs (l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2) corresponding to the segments, which are expected to be provided across `q` lines. Therefore, while it captures the value of `q`, it lacks the logic to process or return the segment values.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts input values representing the number of queries and the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis, specifically integers `q`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, but does not validate these inputs or ensure that they adhere to the specified ranges. It simply returns the input as a string without performing any calculations or further processing.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an iterable map object containing integers obtained from splitting an input string by spaces. This iterable can be converted to a list or iterated over directly, but it does not return a list itself. Additionally, if the input is empty, the function will return an empty iterable.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from input. It returns a map object that converts these integers into strings. It does not handle any specific queries, nor does it check for the constraints provided in the annotations, such as the ranges of l1, r1, l2, and r2 or the number of queries.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `q` representing the number of queries, each consisting of four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, which define two segments on the x-axis. It returns the result from `func_3()`, which is expected to handle the input data and perform computations based on the provided segments. However, since `func_5()` does not directly handle inputs, it relies entirely on `func_3()` to manage the query data and output.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` initializes a new thread to handle multiple queries consisting of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) within specified bounds. The function does not directly process these queries or return any results; it sets up the environment for handling queries via a separate `main` function, which is not provided in the annotated code. There are no validations or specific return values in this function, and the actual processing of the queries is expected to occur in the `main` function.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += int(n % 10)
        n = int(n / 10)
    return sum
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It processes the number by repeatedly taking the last digit and summing it until `n` is reduced to 0. There are no edge cases that handle invalid inputs, but as per the code, it only works with non-negative integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains four integers. It returns `True` if `x` is not empty and if `x` contains exactly one tuple (i.e., it evaluates to a power of two in terms of its bit representation), otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not return the list of tuples or the least significant bit as stated in the annotations.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts a positive integer `x` representing the number of queries and a list `y` of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers. The function does not process these tuples in a meaningful way; instead, it replaces `x` with `y` and manipulates `y` using the modulo operation until `y` becomes zero. Ultimately, the function returns the last non-zero value of `x`, which, due to the structure of the code, is not a tuple but rather an integer, representing the last processed value of `y`. The code does not effectively utilize the tuples in `y` as described in the annotations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return (gcd, x, y)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of tuples `a` representing segments on the x-axis and an integer `b`. It returns `b`, 0, and 1 if `a` is equal to 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `b` and `a`, along with two additional integers `x` and `y` that are computed based on the recursive results. This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the gcd and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of queries (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3. It also returns False if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself for values of `n` greater than or equal to 5, and returns True if `n` is greater than 3 and is a prime number.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    if n == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    p = func_12(n >> 1)
    c = p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0])
    d = p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]
    if n & 1:
        return c + 2 * d
    else:
        return c + d
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and, if `n` is 0, returns the tuple (0, 1). For any positive integer `n`, the function recursively calculates values based on the half of `n` (using bitwise right shift) and returns either `c + 2 * d` or `c + d` depending on whether `n` is odd or even, where `c` and `d` are derived from previous computations involving recursive calls to `func_12`. The function does not handle any cases where `n` could be negative or zero in the context of its recursive logic beyond the initial check.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function `func_13` sets up to read input from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters directly nor does it return any values. The annotations suggest that it is intended to process queries defined by integers `q`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, but the actual implementation does not perform any operations related to these parameters, as no further logic is provided in the code. Therefore, the function lacks the functionality to process the specified queries based on the described parameters.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    res = 1
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x
        x = x * x
        y >>= 1
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts an integer `x` and a list `y` (which is not actually used in the computation) and returns 1, since it effectively computes `x` raised to the power of 0, which is always 1. The use of the variable `y` appears to be incorrect or misleading as it is not representative of the actual input structure described in the comments. The function does not utilize the tuples in `y` for any computations, and simply reduces `y` to 0 through bitwise right-shifting.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    q = func_1()
    for i in range(q):
        (l1, r1, l2, r2) = func_3()
        func_16(l1, r2)
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts an integer `q`, which denotes the number of queries (with constraints between 1 and 500 inclusive). For each query, it retrieves four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2` (with constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9). It then calls another function, `func_16`, with parameters `l1` and `r2`, for a total of `q` times. However, the function does not return any values or provide feedback based on the calls made.
Function number 16 :

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
