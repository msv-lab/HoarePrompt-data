The provided code aims to find two distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( l_1 \leq a \leq r_1 \) and \( l_2 \leq b \leq r_2 \), for multiple queries. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` to `func_5` focus primarily on reading input, but there's no logic that processes the segments or checks the conditions of selecting distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Missing Logic**: There is no function that actually implements the requirement of finding two distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) based on the segments given. The code structure implies that `func_15` is intended to handle multiple queries but only calls `func_16` with parameters that do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Edge Cases:
- If the segments are very close to each other, say \( [1, 2] \) and \( [1, 2] \), the only integers available are 1 and 2. The code must ensure \( a \neq b \). 
- The code should handle cases where the segments overlap or are adjacent, ensuring the chosen integers are distinct.

### Output Hints Comparison:
The output hints for each function indicate that they handle input but do not engage in any logic to determine the outputs as specified in the problem. For instance:
- `func_16` merely prints values without performing any checks or calculations to ensure \( a \) and \( b \) are distinct.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code does not contain any functional implementations to solve the core problem of selecting distinct integers from the given segments, it fails to meet the problem description requirements.

Correctness: **False**

The code lacks the necessary logic to ensure that two distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) are selected from the defined segments. For instance, if the input is \( 1, 2, 1, 2 \), the code might incorrectly return \( (1, 1) \), violating the requirement that \( a \neq b \). This demonstrates that the code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
