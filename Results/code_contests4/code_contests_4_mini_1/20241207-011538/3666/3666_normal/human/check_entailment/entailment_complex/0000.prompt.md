You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) followed by q lines, each containing four integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 (1 ≤ l_1 < r_1, 1 ≤ l_2 < r_2 ≤ 10^9) representing two segments on the x-axis.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input value q, followed by the integer inputs l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 for each of the q segments on the x-axis.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `q` (which represents the number of segments) from user input and returns this integer. The function does not, however, handle or return the subsequent inputs (l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2) corresponding to the segments, which are expected to be provided across `q` lines. Therefore, while it captures the value of `q`, it lacks the logic to process or return the segment values.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) representing the number of queries. For each query, there are four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 (1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9) representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis, such that l1 ≤ a ≤ r1 and l2 ≤ b ≤ r2, and a ≠ b.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input values representing the number of queries and the endpoints of the two segments, which includes integers q, l1, r1, l2, and r2 within specified ranges.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input values representing the number of queries and the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis, specifically integers `q`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, but does not validate these inputs or ensure that they adhere to the specified ranges. It simply returns the input as a string without performing any calculations or further processing.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500, and for each query i (1 ≤ i ≤ q), l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} are integers such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, and l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an iterable map object containing integers obtained from splitting an input string by spaces. This iterable can be converted to a list or iterated over directly, but it does not return a list itself. Additionally, if the input is empty, the function will return an empty iterable.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function handles multiple queries where each query consists of four integers l1, r1, l2, and r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. The number of queries q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that converts the input string of space-separated integers into strings
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from input. It returns a map object that converts these integers into strings. It does not handle any specific queries, nor does it check for the constraints provided in the annotations, such as the ranges of l1, r1, l2, and r2 or the number of queries.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) representing the number of queries, and for each query, there are four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 (1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9) representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns the result of func_3() which processes the integer q representing the number of queries and the segments defined by the integers l1, r1, l2, r2 for each query.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `q` representing the number of queries, each consisting of four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, which define two segments on the x-axis. It returns the result from `func_3()`, which is expected to handle the input data and perform computations based on the provided segments. However, since `func_5()` does not directly handle inputs, it relies entirely on `func_3()` to manage the query data and output.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function handles multiple queries, where each query consists of four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. The number of queries q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` initializes a new thread to handle multiple queries consisting of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) within specified bounds. The function does not directly process these queries or return any results; it sets up the environment for handling queries via a separate `main` function, which is not provided in the annotated code. There are no validations or specific return values in this function, and the actual processing of the queries is expected to occur in the `main` function.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and each query consists of four integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 such that 1 ≤ l_1 < r_1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l_2 < r_2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_7(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += int(n % 10)
        
        n = int(n / 10)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `sum` is the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the original value of n, which is 0, resulting in a sum of 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It processes the number by repeatedly taking the last digit and summing it until `n` is reduced to 0. There are no edge cases that handle invalid inputs, but as per the code, it only works with non-negative integers.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9, and the number of queries q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500.
def func_8(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns the list of tuples 'x' and the result of the bitwise operation 'not x & (x - 1)' which is an integer representing the least significant bit that is set in 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains four integers. It returns `True` if `x` is not empty and if `x` contains exactly one tuple (i.e., it evaluates to a power of two in terms of its bit representation), otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not return the list of tuples or the least significant bit as stated in the annotations.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_9(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the last non-zero tuple from `y`, `y` is 0, which occurs when the loop terminates after processing all queries.
    return x
    #The program returns the last non-zero tuple from 'y', which is 0, that occurs when the loop terminates after processing all queries.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` representing the number of queries and a list `y` of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers. The function does not process these tuples in a meaningful way; instead, it replaces `x` with `y` and manipulates `y` using the modulo operation until `y` becomes zero. Ultimately, the function returns the last non-zero value of `x`, which, due to the structure of the code, is not a tuple but rather an integer, representing the last processed value of `y`. The code does not effectively utilize the tuples in `y` as described in the annotations.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where each element is a tuple of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis for q queries, with 1 ≤ q ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ l1, r1, l2, r2 ≤ 10^9, l1 < r1, and l2 < r2.
def func_10(a, b):
    if (a == 0) :
        return b, 0, 1
        #The program returns the value of b, which is undefined in the current context, along with the integers 0 and 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of integers where each element is a tuple of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) representing the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis for q queries, with 1 ≤ q ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ l1, r1, l2, r2 ≤ 10^9, l1 < r1, and l2 < r2. The variable `a` is not equal to 0.
    gcd, x1, y1 = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns gcd, x, and y where gcd is the greatest common divisor calculated from func_10, x is computed as y1 - b // a * x1, and y is equal to x1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `a` representing segments on the x-axis and an integer `b`. It returns `b`, 0, and 1 if `a` is equal to 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `b` and `a`, along with two additional integers `x` and `y` that are computed based on the recursive results. This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the gcd and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), and for each query, the integers l1, r1, l2, r2 are such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_11(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of queries where n is greater than 1, and for each query, the integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2` are such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating a successful evaluation of the queries.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of queries where `n` is greater than 3, and for each query, the integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2` are such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of queries where `n` is greater than 3, and for each query, the integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2` are such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. `n` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3.
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 25 and is not divisible by 2 or 3; `i` is greater than or equal to 5 and has been incremented by 6 until `i * i` exceeds `n`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of queries (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3. It also returns False if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself for values of `n` greater than or equal to 5, and returns True if `n` is greater than 3 and is a prime number.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, l_1, r_1, l_2, and r_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ l_1 < r_1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l_2 < r_2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_12(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0, 1
        #The program returns the tuple (0, 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, `l_1`, `r_1`, `l_2`, and `r_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_1` < `r_1` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `l_2` < `r_2` ≤ 10^9. The value of `n` is greater than 0.
    p = func_12(n >> 1)
    c = p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0])
    d = p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]
    if (n & 1) :
        return c + 2 * d
        #The program returns c plus 2 times the value of d, where d is the sum of the squares of the two elements in the tuple p returned from func_12(n >> 1)
    else :
        return c + d
        #The program returns the sum of 'c' and 'd', where 'd' is the sum of the squares of the first two elements of the result from `func_12(n >> 1)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and, if `n` is 0, returns the tuple (0, 1). For any positive integer `n`, the function recursively calculates values based on the half of `n` (using bitwise right shift) and returns either `c + 2 * d` or `c + d` depending on whether `n` is odd or even, where `c` and `d` are derived from previous computations involving recursive calls to `func_12`. The function does not handle any cases where `n` could be negative or zero in the context of its recursive logic beyond the initial check.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 500, and for each query, l1, r1, l2, r2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ l1 < r1, 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` sets up to read input from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters directly nor does it return any values. The annotations suggest that it is intended to process queries defined by integers `q`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, but the actual implementation does not perform any operations related to these parameters, as no further logic is provided in the code. Therefore, the function lacks the functionality to process the specified queries based on the described parameters.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ x ≤ 500), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_14(x, y):
    res = 1
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x
        
        x = x * x
        
        y >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is the result of raising the initial value of `x` to the power of the initial value of `y`, and `x` is the final value after squaring each time during the iterations.
    return res
    #The program returns the result of raising the initial value of x to the power of 0, which is 1, since any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and a list `y` (which is not actually used in the computation) and returns 1, since it effectively computes `x` raised to the power of 0, which is always 1. The use of the variable `y` appears to be incorrect or misleading as it is not representative of the actual input structure described in the comments. The function does not utilize the tuples in `y` for any computations, and simply reduces `y` to 0 through bitwise right-shifting.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and for each query, l1, r1, l2, r2 are integers such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9.
def func_15():
    q = func_1()
    for i in range(q):
        l1, r1, l2, r2 = func_3()
        
        func_16(l1, r2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is `q - 1`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2` are the last values assigned from the final call to `func_3()`, `func_16(l1, r2)` has been called `q` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `q`, which denotes the number of queries (with constraints between 1 and 500 inclusive). For each query, it retrieves four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2` (with constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9). It then calls another function, `func_16`, with parameters `l1` and `r2`, for a total of `q` times. However, the function does not return any values or provide feedback based on the calls made.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a list of integers where each query consists of four integers l1, r1, l2, r2 such that 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. The number of queries is a positive integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500).
def func_16():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:

        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a list of integers; `file` contains the string representation of all integers in `args`, separated by `sep`; `at_start` is False.

    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a list of integers, `file` is updated with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is False. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, `file.flush()` is called to flush the stream.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers called `args`, which represents queries containing four integers each (l1, r1, l2, r2) under the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. It writes all integers from `args` to a specified output stream, separating them with a specified separator, and finishes with a specified end character. If instructed, it also flushes the output stream. The function does not directly process the query values but simply outputs them.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
