Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. 

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program has several functions that seem to handle input, but none of them actually read the full set of required values (l1, r1, l2, r2) per query properly to produce results. For instance, `func_3` and `func_5` are designed to read some inputs, but they do not return valid tuples of (l1, r1, l2, r2) for processing.

2. **Logic for Output**: The key requirement of the problem is to find two distinct integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( l_1 \leq a \leq r_1 \), \( l_2 \leq b \leq r_2 \), and \( a \neq b \). The program does not implement any logic to select these integers based on the input ranges. 

3. **Function Calls and Flow**: The main function (`func_15`) tries to call `func_3` to get l1, r1, l2, r2, but the output of `func_3` is not being properly utilized to compute or print the required values, as it only collects values and does not check for distinctness or constraints.

4. **Final Output**: The function `func_16` is structured to print values but does not actually receive valid inputs nor is it invoked with the correct parameters to output valid results for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to implement the core logic needed to meet the problem's requirements. There are no mechanisms to ensure that the selected integers \( a \) and \( b \) meet the conditions of the segments, nor does it handle output correctly. Thus, it does not adhere to the problem description as required.
