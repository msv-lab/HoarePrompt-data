Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the required functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires finding two distinct integers `a` and `b`, such that `l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1`, `l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2`, and `a ≠ b` for each query. However, the code lacks the logic to do this. 

1. **Missing Logic**: The functions, particularly `func_15`, are not performing any calculations to find the two integers; they are merely reading inputs and calling another function (`func_16`) which seems to be designed for output but does not perform the actual logic needed to determine valid pairs of integers.

2. **Input Handling**: The annotations suggest that the functions do not properly handle or process the input values (`l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`) to generate distinct integers as required. For example, in the provided `func_15`, it only retrieves inputs without processing them to find valid pairs.

3. **Example Case**: The example from the problem statement indicates that for some segments, valid pairs can be easily determined (e.g., for the segments `[1, 2]` and `[1, 2]`, a valid output is `2 1`), but the code does not demonstrate any logic that computes these outputs based on the input ranges.

Overall, the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it lacks the necessary logic to compute distinct integers from the provided segments. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
