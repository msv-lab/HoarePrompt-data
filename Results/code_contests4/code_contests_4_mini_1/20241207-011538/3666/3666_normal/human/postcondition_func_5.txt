The function `func_6` initializes a new thread to handle multiple queries consisting of four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) within specified bounds. The function does not directly process these queries or return any results; it sets up the environment for handling queries via a separate `main` function, which is not provided in the annotated code. There are no validations or specific return values in this function, and the actual processing of the queries is expected to occur in the `main` function.
