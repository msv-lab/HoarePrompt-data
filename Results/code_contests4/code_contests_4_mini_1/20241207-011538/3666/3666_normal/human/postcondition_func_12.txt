The function `func_13` sets up to read input from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters directly nor does it return any values. The annotations suggest that it is intended to process queries defined by integers `q`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, but the actual implementation does not perform any operations related to these parameters, as no further logic is provided in the code. Therefore, the function lacks the functionality to process the specified queries based on the described parameters.
