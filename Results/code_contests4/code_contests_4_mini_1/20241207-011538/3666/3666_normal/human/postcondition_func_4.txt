The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `q` representing the number of queries, each consisting of four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, which define two segments on the x-axis. It returns the result from `func_3()`, which is expected to handle the input data and perform computations based on the provided segments. However, since `func_5()` does not directly handle inputs, it relies entirely on `func_3()` to manage the query data and output.
