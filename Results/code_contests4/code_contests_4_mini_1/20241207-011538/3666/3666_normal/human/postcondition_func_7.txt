The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains four integers. It returns `True` if `x` is not empty and if `x` contains exactly one tuple (i.e., it evaluates to a power of two in terms of its bit representation), otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not return the list of tuples or the least significant bit as stated in the annotations.
