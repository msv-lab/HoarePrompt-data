The function accepts an integer `q`, which denotes the number of queries (with constraints between 1 and 500 inclusive). For each query, it retrieves four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2` (with constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9). It then calls another function, `func_16`, with parameters `l1` and `r2`, for a total of `q` times. However, the function does not return any values or provide feedback based on the calls made.
