The function accepts a list of tuples `a` representing segments on the x-axis and an integer `b`. It returns `b`, 0, and 1 if `a` is equal to 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `b` and `a`, along with two additional integers `x` and `y` that are computed based on the recursive results. This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the gcd and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
