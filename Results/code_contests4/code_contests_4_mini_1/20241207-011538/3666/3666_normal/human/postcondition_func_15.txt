The function accepts a list of integers called `args`, which represents queries containing four integers each (l1, r1, l2, r2) under the constraints 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. It writes all integers from `args` to a specified output stream, separating them with a specified separator, and finishes with a specified end character. If instructed, it also flushes the output stream. The function does not directly process the query values but simply outputs them.
