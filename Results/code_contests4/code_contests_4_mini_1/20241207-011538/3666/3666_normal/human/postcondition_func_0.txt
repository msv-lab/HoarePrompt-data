The function accepts an integer `q` (which represents the number of segments) from user input and returns this integer. The function does not, however, handle or return the subsequent inputs (l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2) corresponding to the segments, which are expected to be provided across `q` lines. Therefore, while it captures the value of `q`, it lacks the logic to process or return the segment values.
