The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of queries (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3. It also returns False if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself for values of `n` greater than or equal to 5, and returns True if `n` is greater than 3 and is a prime number.
