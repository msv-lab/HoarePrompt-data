The code assigns default values to `sep` and `file` by popping them from the `kwargs` dictionary. If `sep` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space character (' '), and if `file` is not provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The values of `args`, the list of integers, and the specific integer queries remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a list of integers; `sep` is either a provided value or a space character; `file` is either a provided value or `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` is a list of integers; `sep` is either a provided value or a space character; `file` is either a provided value or `sys.stdout.**
