The `file.write(sep)` operation writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. However, the previous state does not provide information about the value of `sep`, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and acknowledges the action taken.

Output State: **`args` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `file` contains the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, and `sep` is written to the file.**
