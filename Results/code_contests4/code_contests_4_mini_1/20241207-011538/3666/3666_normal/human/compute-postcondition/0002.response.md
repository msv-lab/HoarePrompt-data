The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `args`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a list of integers; `sep` is either a provided value or a space character; `file` is either a provided value or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`args` is a list of integers; `sep` is either a provided value or a space character; `file` is either a provided value or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is True**
