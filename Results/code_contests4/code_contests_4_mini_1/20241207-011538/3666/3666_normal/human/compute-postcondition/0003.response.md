According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the `args` list contains at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `at_start` being True does not affect the execution of the loop directly. However, for the loop to be executed the first time, `x` should be set to the first integer in the `args` list.

State: **`args` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the `args` list**
