The function `func_16` accepts a parameter `args`, which is a list of integers. Each query in `args` consists of four integers: `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, where the constraints are as follows: 1 ≤ l1 < r1 ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ l2 < r2 ≤ 10^9. The number of queries, denoted as `q`, is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ q ≤ 500. After executing the function body, the exact return value is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes these queries based on the given parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `args`, with each query containing four integers (l1, r1, l2, r2) under specified constraints, and processes these queries.**
