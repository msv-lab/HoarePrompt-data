The function accepts input values representing the number of queries and the endpoints of two segments on the x-axis, specifically integers `q`, `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, and `r2`, but does not validate these inputs or ensure that they adhere to the specified ranges. It simply returns the input as a string without performing any calculations or further processing.
