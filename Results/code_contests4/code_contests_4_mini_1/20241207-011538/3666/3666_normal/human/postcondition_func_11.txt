The function accepts a positive integer `n` and, if `n` is 0, returns the tuple (0, 1). For any positive integer `n`, the function recursively calculates values based on the half of `n` (using bitwise right shift) and returns either `c + 2 * d` or `c + d` depending on whether `n` is odd or even, where `c` and `d` are derived from previous computations involving recursive calls to `func_12`. The function does not handle any cases where `n` could be negative or zero in the context of its recursive logic beyond the initial check.
