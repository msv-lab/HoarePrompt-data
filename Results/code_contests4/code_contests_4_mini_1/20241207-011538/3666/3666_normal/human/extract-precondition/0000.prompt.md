You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
