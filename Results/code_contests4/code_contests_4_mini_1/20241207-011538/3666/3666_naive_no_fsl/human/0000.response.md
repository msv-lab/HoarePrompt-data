Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to find two distinct integers, `a` and `b`, such that `l1 ≤ a ≤ r1`, `l2 ≤ b ≤ r2`, and `a ≠ b` for each query. However, the implementation in `func_15` is incomplete as it does not actually contain logic to determine and print the values of `a` and `b` based on the input segments.

The line `func_16(l1, r2)` in `func_15` uses `l1` from the first segment and `r2` from the second segment but does not ensure that `a` and `b` are distinct. In cases where `l1` equals `r2`, this will produce an invalid output as it violates the requirement that `a ≠ b`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2 2 3
```
Here, `l1 = 1`, `r1 = 2`, `l2 = 2`, and `r2 = 3`. A valid output would be `a = 1` and `b = 2`, but since `a` cannot equal `b`, an error in logic is present.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure distinct integers for all possible cases, the correctness is marked as **False**.
