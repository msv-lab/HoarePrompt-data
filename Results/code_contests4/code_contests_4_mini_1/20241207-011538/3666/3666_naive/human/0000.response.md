To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and analyze the program.

**Problem Description:**
- We are given two segments [l1; r1] and [l2; r2] on the x-axis.
- We need to find two integers a and b such that:
  - l1 ≤ a ≤ r1
  - l2 ≤ b ≤ r2
  - a ≠ b
- The function will handle multiple queries, and it is guaranteed that a solution exists for every case.

**Program Analysis:**
The program defines a main function `func_15` that reads multiple queries and processes them. The crucial part of the program that determines if it meets the requirements is the call to `func_16(l1, r2)`. 

However, there are several potential issues:
1. **Selection of Values**: The program chooses `a = l1` and `b = r2`. If `r2` coincides with `l1`, then `a` would equal `b` (i.e., `l1` could be equal to `r2`), violating the constraint that `a ≠ b`.
2. **Lack of Generality**: The program does not account for cases where choosing the endpoints might lead to equality. It only checks for `l1` and `r2`, which may not suffice in all scenarios.

**Example Case Where It Fails:**
- Let's take the input:
  ```
  1
  1 3 1 3
  ```
  Here, both segments are [1, 3]. If the program outputs `1` from `l1` and `3` from `r2`, then `a = 1` and `b = 3` are valid. But if it were to output `1` and `1`, it would fail since `a` should not equal `b`. 

In this case, the program does not handle all potential inputs correctly, specifically when the segments overlap completely.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program can produce invalid outputs in certain scenarios, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**.
