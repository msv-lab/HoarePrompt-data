The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the on and off times of the lamps. The first element of `arr` is a tuple containing two integers `n` (the total number of lamps) and `k` (the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously). The function processes this list to calculate the cumulative sums of the tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a list `tem`, which contains these cumulative sums with a length equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of tuples representing lamp timings and return a list of cumulative sums based on those timings. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where the first tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `tem` containing the cumulative sums of the tuples from `arr` with length `n`.**
