The code attempts to append a new value to the list `tem`. The value being appended is the result of the expression `tem[i] + arr[i]`. 

1. The current value of `i` is 2.
2. The current value of `tem[i]` is `tem[2]`, which is `(a, b, c, d)`.
3. The code checks for `arr[i]`, which requires `arr` to have at least 3 tuples. The value of `arr[i]` is not provided in the initial state, but it is necessary for the execution of the code.
4. Assuming `arr[i]` is compatible with the tuple type for concatenation (e.g., if `arr[i]` is also a tuple), the operation proceeds. If `arr[i]` is, for example, `(e, f)`, then `tem[2] + arr[i]` would result in `(a, b, c, d, e, f)`.
5. After the operation, a new value will be appended to `tem`.

However, since we do not have the specific value of `arr[i]`, we cannot provide a definitive output for the new state of `tem`. Therefore, the output state is based on the assumption of appending a compatible value to `tem`.

Output State: **`tem` is [0, (a, b), (a, b, c, d), (a, b, c, d) + arr[2]]; `i` is 2**
