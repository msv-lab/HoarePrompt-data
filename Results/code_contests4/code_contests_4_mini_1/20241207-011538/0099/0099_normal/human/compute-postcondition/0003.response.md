The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads from standard input to obtain data related to the lamps, specifically their on and off times. After executing the function body, it returns a readline method from a BytesIO object that was created by reading this input data. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to read lamp on and off time data from standard input and return it as a readline method for further processing.
