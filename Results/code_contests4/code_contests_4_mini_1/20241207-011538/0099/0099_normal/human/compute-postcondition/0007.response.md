To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop code and the output states provided.

The loop iterates through the length of `arr`, and for each iteration `i`, it appends the sum of `tem[i]` and `arr[i]` to the list `tem`. 

From the output states provided:
- After 1 iteration, `tem` contains `[0, (a, b)]` which implies `tem[1]` is equal to `tem[0] + arr[0]`.
- After 2 iterations, `tem` is `[0, (a, b), (a, b, c, d)]` indicating that `tem[2]` is `tem[1] + arr[1]`.
- After 3 iterations, `tem` is `[0, (a, b), (a, b, c, d), (a, b, c, d) + arr[2]]`, suggesting that `tem[3]` is `tem[2] + arr[2]`.

After this pattern, we can infer that if `arr` contains `n` tuples, the loop will execute `n` times, and `tem` will contain `n + 1` elements (the initial 0 plus the results of each of the `n` iterations).

In the case where `arr` is empty (length of 0), the loop does not execute, which means `tem` will remain as `[0]`.

Thus, for the output state after all iterations of the loop:
- If `arr` contains `n` tuples, `tem` will be a list where `tem[j]` for `j = 1 to n` is the cumulative tuple sum from `arr`.

Therefore, the overall output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`tem` is a list where `tem[j]` for `j = 1 to n` is the cumulative sum of tuples from `arr`, `arr` is a list of tuples, `n` is the length of `arr`.**
