Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000); `k` is a positive integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each lamp's on and off times `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n; and `sys.stdout` is redirected to a `BytesIO` object.**
