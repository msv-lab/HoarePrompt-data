According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `arr` contains at least 2 tuples. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 tuples, and `i` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`tem` is [0, (a, b), (a, b, c, d)], for the loop to execute a second time `arr` must contain at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2**
