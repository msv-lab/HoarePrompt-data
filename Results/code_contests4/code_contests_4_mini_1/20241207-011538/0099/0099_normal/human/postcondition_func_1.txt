The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `r`. If `n` is less than `r`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of the division of the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `(n - r)`, calculated using the `div` function. The function assumes that `facs` is an array containing precomputed factorial values for integers up to `n`.
