The function accepts two parameters: `be`, which is a list of integers representing the start times of lamps, and `en`, which is an integer representing the end time. It calculates a list `res` where the first element is 1, and subsequent elements are derived from multiplying the last element of `res` by each integer from `be` to `en`. If `be` is greater than `en`, the function only returns `[1]`. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where `be` is a list; it would raise a TypeError when attempting to iterate over it as a range. Therefore, the actual implementation does not align with the annotations, which imply that `be` and `en` can be compared directly.
