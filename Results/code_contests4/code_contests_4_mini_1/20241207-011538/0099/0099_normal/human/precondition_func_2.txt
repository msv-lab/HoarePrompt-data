arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the on and off times of the lamps. Additionally, the first element of arr is a tuple containing two integers n and k, where n is the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and k is the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Each l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) represents the time period for each lamp.
