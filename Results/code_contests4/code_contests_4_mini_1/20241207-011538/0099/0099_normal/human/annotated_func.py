#State of the program right berfore the function call: be is a list of integers representing the start times (l_i) of n lamps, en is a list of integers representing the end times (r_i) of n lamps, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and each l_i and r_i are integers satisfying 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `be` is a list of integers representing start times, `en` is a list of integers representing end times, `res` is [1, mult(1, be), mult(mult(1, be), be + 1), ..., mult(..., en)] if `be` ≤ `en`, otherwise `res` is [1].
    return res
    #The program returns the list 'res', which contains a sequence of values derived from the start times 'be' and end times 'en', following the specified conditions. If 'be' is less than or equal to 'en', 'res' contains calculated values based on the products of 'be' and 'en'; otherwise, it returns [1].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `be`, which is a list of integers representing the start times of lamps, and `en`, which is an integer representing the end time. It calculates a list `res` where the first element is 1, and subsequent elements are derived from multiplying the last element of `res` by each integer from `be` to `en`. If `be` is greater than `en`, the function only returns `[1]`. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where `be` is a list; it would raise a TypeError when attempting to iterate over it as a range. Therefore, the actual implementation does not align with the annotations, which imply that `be` and `en` can be compared directly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each lamp, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2(n, r):

        #The program returns the value 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and for each lamp, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `r`.
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the value of div(facs[n], facs[n - r]), where facs[n] and facs[n - r] are the factorial values for n and (n - r) respectively, and n is a positive integer between 1 and 300,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `r`. If `n` is less than `r`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of the division of the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `(n - r)`, calculated using the `div` function. The function assumes that `facs` is an array containing precomputed factorial values for integers up to `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the on and off times of the lamps. Additionally, the first element of arr is a tuple containing two integers n and k, where n is the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and k is the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Each l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) represents the time period for each lamp.
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list where `tem[j]` for `j = 1 to n` is the cumulative sum of tuples from `arr`, `arr` is a list of tuples, `n` is the length of `arr`.
    return tem
    #The program returns the list 'tem' which contains the cumulative sums of tuples from the list 'arr' with length 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where the first tuple contains two integers `n` (the total number of lamps) and `k` (the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously). The function calculates and returns a list `tem` that contains the cumulative sums of the integers in the tuples from `arr`. However, it does not take into account the specific lamp on and off times or any conditions related to the values of `k` or how they relate to the lamps; it simply returns a cumulative sum based on the input list. Additionally, it assumes that the elements in `arr` are integers, which may not align with the described input as tuples of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000), k is a positive integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and each lamp's on and off times l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n.

    #The program returns a readline method from a BytesIO object created by reading from standard input, which contains the data of the lamps represented by their on and off times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a readline method from a BytesIO object, which is created by reading the entire standard input. This input is expected to contain the on and off times of lamps, but the actual reading and processing of lamp data is not performed within this function, leaving the handling of the lamp data to the caller.
