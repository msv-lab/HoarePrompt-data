You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: be is a list of integers representing the start times (l_i) of n lamps, en is a list of integers representing the end times (r_i) of n lamps, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and each l_i and r_i are integers satisfying 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `be` is a list of integers representing start times, `en` is a list of integers representing end times, `res` is [1, mult(1, be), mult(mult(1, be), be + 1), ..., mult(..., en)] if `be` ≤ `en`, otherwise `res` is [1].
    return res
    #The program returns the list 'res', which contains a sequence of values derived from the start times 'be' and end times 'en', following the specified conditions. If 'be' is less than or equal to 'en', 'res' contains calculated values based on the products of 'be' and 'en'; otherwise, it returns [1].

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each lamp, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the value 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and for each lamp, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `r`.
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the value of div(facs[n], facs[n - r]), where facs[n] and facs[n - r] are the factorial values for n and (n - r) respectively, and n is a positive integer between 1 and 300,000.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the on and off times of the lamps. Additionally, the first element of arr is a tuple containing two integers n and k, where n is the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and k is the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Each l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) represents the time period for each lamp.
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list where `tem[j]` for `j = 1 to n` is the cumulative sum of tuples from `arr`, `arr` is a list of tuples, `n` is the length of `arr`.
    return tem
    #The program returns the list 'tem' which contains the cumulative sums of tuples from the list 'arr' with length 'n'

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000), k is a positive integer representing the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and each lamp's on and off times l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 for i from 1 to n.
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a readline method from a BytesIO object created by reading from standard input, which contains the data of the lamps represented by their on and off times.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
