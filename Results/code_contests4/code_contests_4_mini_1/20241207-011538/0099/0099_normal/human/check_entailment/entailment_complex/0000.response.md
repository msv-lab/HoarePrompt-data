Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

1. The main issue lies in the functions, particularly `func_1` and `func_3`, which do not seem to handle the logic of checking overlapping lamp intervals as required by the problem description. The solution must find combinations of k lamps that can all be turned on at the same time, but these functions do not address the overlap of time intervals for the lamps.

2. Specifically, `func_3` is supposed to calculate the cumulative sums of the tuples representing the lamps, but it does not take into account the time intervals (l_i, r_i) and does not determine if there are k lamps that can be turned on simultaneously. This means that it lacks the necessary logic to determine valid combinations of lamps based on their on/off times.

3. Additionally, the annotations for `func_1` mention a TypeError that would occur due to incorrect handling of the input types, indicating that the implementation is flawed and would not execute correctly.

4. The sampling of edge cases from the problem description (like when k = n and all lamps can only be on at a specific time) demonstrates that the implementation would fail to return the correct results due to lack of handling of the overlapping intervals.

In summary, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description across multiple scenarios, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
