Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key points of failure:

1. **Function Definitions and Logic**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` do not implement any logic related to determining the number of ways to select `k` lamps that can be turned on simultaneously. Instead, they perform unrelated operations such as computing cumulative sums and factorials, which do not align with the problem of checking overlapping time intervals for lamps.

2. **Missing Implementation**: There is no function that checks for overlapping intervals among the lamps based on their on (`l_i`) and off (`r_i`) times. The problem requires finding combinations of lamps that can be turned on simultaneously, which involves determining if there exists a common time when at least `k` lamps are turned on. This essential logic is absent.

3. **Input and Output Handling**: The program lacks a main function or a clear input/output structure that handles the reading of input (the number of lamps and their respective on/off times) and the output of the result. The current functions do not effectively utilize the input format as described in the problem.

In conclusion, since the program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid combinations of lamps that can be turned on simultaneously, it does not fulfill the problem requirements. Therefore, it is incorrect.
