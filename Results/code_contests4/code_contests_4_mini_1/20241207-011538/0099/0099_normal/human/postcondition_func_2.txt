The function accepts a list of tuples `arr`, where the first tuple contains two integers `n` (the total number of lamps) and `k` (the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously). The function calculates and returns a list `tem` that contains the cumulative sums of the integers in the tuples from `arr`. However, it does not take into account the specific lamp on and off times or any conditions related to the values of `k` or how they relate to the lamps; it simply returns a cumulative sum based on the input list. Additionally, it assumes that the elements in `arr` are integers, which may not align with the described input as tuples of integers.
