Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field as `(n * m) / 2`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not accurately account for the curse condition specified in the problem description. 

For instance, consider the input `1 1`. The field is only 1x1, so only one soldier can be placed without any conflict. However, the program would output `0.5`, which is not a valid number of soldiers (you cannot have half a soldier). 

Another example is input `2 2`, where the maximum number of soldiers should be `2`, but the program would output `2`, which is correct in this case, but it does not hold for all scenarios. 

Therefore, the logic used in the program fails to correctly determine the maximum number of soldiers that can be positioned without conflict, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
