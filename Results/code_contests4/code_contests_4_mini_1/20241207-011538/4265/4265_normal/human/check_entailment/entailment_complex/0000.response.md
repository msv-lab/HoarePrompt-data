Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on an n × m field such that no two soldiers conflict with each other based on the curse. The curse is defined by the squared distance between soldiers being equal to 5.

However, the provided program calculates `(n * m) / 2`, which represents half of the area of the rectangular field, but it does not take into account the specific positioning of soldiers and the constraints imposed by the curse. 

For instance, in the example of a 2 × 4 field, the correct maximum number of soldiers is 4, but using the formula `(2 * 4) / 2` would yield 4, which is coincidentally correct for that specific case. However, in other cases, such as the 3 × 4 example, the program would calculate `(3 * 4) / 2 = 6`, which is the correct answer. The program does not provide a valid and general approach to account for all configurations and constraints defined by the curse since it relies solely on the area of the field.

Thus, the approach of simply halving the area does not ensure that the configuration of soldiers adheres to the curse condition for all possible field sizes, leading to potential inaccuracies. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
