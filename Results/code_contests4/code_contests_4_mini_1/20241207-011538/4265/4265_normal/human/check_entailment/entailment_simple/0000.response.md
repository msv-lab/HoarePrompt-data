The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on an n × m field without any two soldiers being in positions that lead to a squared distance of exactly 5. 

The key insight from the problem is that if a soldier is placed at (x1, y1), then soldiers cannot be placed at positions that are exactly 5 units away in squared distance, which corresponds to the following pairs of differences: 

- (±1, ±4)
- (±4, ±1)
- (±2, ±3)
- (±3, ±2)

This means the placement of soldiers cannot be done randomly, and simply calculating \( n \times m / 2 \) does not take the curse into account. 

For example:
- For a 2x4 field, the program outputs \( 2 \times 4 / 2 = 4 \), which is correct in this case, but this does not guarantee that it will be correct for all cases.
- For a 3x4 field, the program calculates \( 3 \times 4 / 2 = 6 \), which is also correct. 

However, the logic fails for larger dimensions or specific placements where the curse kicks in and affects the possible arrangements of soldiers.

Thus, the program does not correctly account for the interactions between soldiers based on the curse and may lead to incorrect maximum counts. It oversimplifies the problem by merely halving the total number of cells, which does not guarantee valid placements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
