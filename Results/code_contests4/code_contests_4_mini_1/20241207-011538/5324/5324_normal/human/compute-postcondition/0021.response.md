The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The initial value of `pos` is `a[1][1]`, which is a positive integer, and thus `prev` will now equal `a[1][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `dist` is updated by adding `abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is `a[1][1]`, `pos` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `dist` is updated by adding `abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is `a[1][1]`, `pos` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 0**
