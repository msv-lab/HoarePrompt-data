According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer, it is guaranteed to be at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. The other variables `dist`, `prev`, and `pos` do not affect the execution of the loop but may be relevant for the loop body. 

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0, since it will be incremented during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `dist` is the total distance computed as the accumulated sum of absolute differences, `prev` is 1, `pos` is equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1], `i` is 0**
