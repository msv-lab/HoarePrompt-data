The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. Since `pos` is currently updated to `a[4][1]`, the value of `prev` will now also be equal to `a[4][1]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `dist`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `pos` is now updated to `a[4][1]`, `dist` is updated by adding abs(a[4][1] - a[4][1]), `prev` is now equal to `a[4][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `pos` is now updated to `a[4][1]`, `dist` is updated by adding abs(a[4][1] - a[4][1]), `prev` is now equal to `a[4][1]**
