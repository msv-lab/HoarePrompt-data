The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. The parameter `a` is a list containing 2 * n integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the list. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specific configuration of the list `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of 2 * n integers, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and returns a result based on the arrangement of these integers.**
