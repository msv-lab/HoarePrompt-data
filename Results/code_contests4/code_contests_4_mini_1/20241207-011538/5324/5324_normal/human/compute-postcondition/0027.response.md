The variable `pos` is assigned the value from the array `a` at the index `[2 * i + 1][1]`. Given that `i` is 2, we first calculate `2 * i + 1`, which results in `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`. Therefore, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[5][1]`. The values of `n` and `i` do not change as a result of this assignment. Since `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, it is still a positive integer greater than 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[5][1]**
