To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `prev` is `a[1][1]`.
2. The variable `pos` is `a[2 * i + 1][1]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `pos` is `a[3][1]`.
3. The code `dist += abs(pos - prev)` updates `dist` by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`.

Since `dist` is updated by adding `abs(pos - prev)`, we need to know the values of `pos` and `prev` to calculate the new value of `dist`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `dist` and the unchanged values of `n`, `prev`, `pos`, and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `dist` is updated by adding `abs(a[3][1] - a[1][1])`, `prev` is `a[1][1]`, `pos` is `a[3][1]`, `i` is 1**
