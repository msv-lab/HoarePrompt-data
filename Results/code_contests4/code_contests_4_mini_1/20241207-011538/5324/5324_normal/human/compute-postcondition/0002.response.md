The variable `dist` is initialized to 0. There are no previous values affecting `dist`, and the other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers and their indices; `dist` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers and their indices; `dist` is 0**.
