The variable `n` has already been assigned a positive integer value from the input. The code snippet processes the input provided through `input().split()`, which creates a list of integers. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these split string values into integers. 

Then, `zip` pairs each integer from the list with its corresponding index (ranging from 1 to `2 * n`). Finally, `sorted` organizes these pairs in ascending order based on the integers.

Given that `a` is defined as this sorted list of tuples, the impact on the program is that `a` will now hold a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer from the input and its corresponding index in the range defined.

Therefore, the output state will summarize the new state of the variable `a` after this operation, based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers and their indices.**
