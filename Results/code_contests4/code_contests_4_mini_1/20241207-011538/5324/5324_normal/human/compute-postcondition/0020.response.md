The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `a[1][1]`, and `prev` is 1. The code `dist += abs(pos - prev)` will compute the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, which updates `dist` by adding this value. 

Since `pos` is `a[1][1]`, we can't determine its exact value from the initial state, but we can denote it as `a[1][1]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dist` has been updated by the absolute difference.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `dist` is updated by adding `abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is 1, `pos` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 0**
