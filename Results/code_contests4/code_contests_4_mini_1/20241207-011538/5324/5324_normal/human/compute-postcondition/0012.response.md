According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `pos` is `a[2][1]`, `dist` is updated by adding abs(pos - prev), `prev` is now equal to `pos`**
