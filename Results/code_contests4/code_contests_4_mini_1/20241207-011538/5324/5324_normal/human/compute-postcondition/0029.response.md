The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The value of `pos` is determined by `a[5][1]`, which is not specified in the initial state. The variable `dist` is updated by adding `abs(pos - prev)` to its previous value, but since `prev` is now assigned the value of `pos`, the expression `abs(pos - prev)` evaluates to `0`. Thus, `dist` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, and `pos` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[5][1]`, `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, and `dist` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is assigned the value of `a[5][1]`, `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, and `dist` remains unchanged.**
