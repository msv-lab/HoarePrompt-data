Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `2 * n` integers, where each integer in the range from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It calculates the total distance based on the positions of these integers in the sorted list, by summing the absolute differences between consecutive positions of both the first and second occurrences of each integer, and then prints this total distance. **
