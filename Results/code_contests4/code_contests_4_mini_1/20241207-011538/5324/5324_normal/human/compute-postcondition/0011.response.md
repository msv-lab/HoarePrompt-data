The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, which is `a[2][1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `dist` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `pos` is `a[2][1]`, `dist` is updated by adding abs(pos - prev), and `prev` is now equal to `pos`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `pos` is `a[2][1]`, `dist` is updated by adding abs(pos - prev), `prev` is now equal to `pos`**
