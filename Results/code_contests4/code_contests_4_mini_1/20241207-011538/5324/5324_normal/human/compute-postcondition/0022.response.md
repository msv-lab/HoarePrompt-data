According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `dist` is updated by adding `abs(a[1][1] - 1)`, `prev` is `a[1][1]`, `pos` is `a[1][1]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
