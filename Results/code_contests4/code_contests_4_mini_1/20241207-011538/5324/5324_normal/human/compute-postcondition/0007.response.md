The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `pos`. The previous value of `pos` is `a[0][1]`, which is not specified but is a value from the array `a`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `dist`, and `prev` remain unchanged aside from the assignment to `prev`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dist` is updated to `abs(pos - 1)`, `prev` is now `a[0][1]`, `pos` is `a[0][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dist` is updated to `abs(pos - 1)`, `prev` is now `a[0][1]`, `pos` is `a[0][1]**
