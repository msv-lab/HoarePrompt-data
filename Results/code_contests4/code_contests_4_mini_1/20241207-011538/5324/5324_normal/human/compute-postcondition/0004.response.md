According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Since it is given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute. At the start of the first iteration, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0. The values of `a`, `dist`, and `prev` do not affect the execution of the loop but can be noted for context. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dist` is 0, `prev` is 1**
