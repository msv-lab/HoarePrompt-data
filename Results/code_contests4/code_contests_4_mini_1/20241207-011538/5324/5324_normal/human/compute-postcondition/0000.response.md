Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of 2 * `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, with each integer from 1 to `n` appearing exactly twice in the list; `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer.**
