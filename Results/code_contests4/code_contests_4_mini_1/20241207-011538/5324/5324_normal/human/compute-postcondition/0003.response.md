`prev` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `dist`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers and their indices; `dist` is 0; `prev` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `a` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers and their indices; `dist` is 0; `prev` is 1**
