To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we note the behavior of the loop with respect to the variables involved:

1. The loop iterates `n` times, which means it processes elements from the array `a` based on the current index `i`.
2. The variable `pos` gets updated to `a[2 * i + 1][1]` for each iteration.
3. The variable `dist` accumulates the sum of absolute differences between `pos` and `prev` across all iterations.
4. The variable `prev` is updated to the last value of `pos` at the end of each iteration.

After the loop completes, the values of the variables are as follows:
- `dist` contains the total distance which is the accumulated sum of absolute differences computed throughout all iterations.
- `prev` will hold the value of `pos` from the last iteration, which is `a[2 * (n - 1) + 1][1]`, since the last index `i` would be `n - 1`.
- `pos` will also have the same value as `prev` after the last iteration completes.
- `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `dist` is the total distance computed as the accumulated sum of absolute differences, `prev` is `a[2 * (n - 1) + 1][1]`, `pos` is `a[2 * (n - 1) + 1][1]`.**
