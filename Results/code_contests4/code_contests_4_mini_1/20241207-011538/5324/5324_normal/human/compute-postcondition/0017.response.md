The value of `prev` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `prev` was equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`, but now it is explicitly set to `1`. The values of `n`, `dist`, and `pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `dist` is the total distance computed as the accumulated sum of absolute differences, `prev` is 1, `pos` is equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `dist` is the total distance computed as the accumulated sum of absolute differences, `prev` is 1, `pos` is equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]**
