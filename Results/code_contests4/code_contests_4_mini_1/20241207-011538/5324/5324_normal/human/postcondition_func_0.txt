The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x`, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of GCD. The GCD is computed using the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` and `y` with `y` and `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. The function does not handle cases where `x` or `y` are negative, which can lead to unexpected results as GCD is typically defined only for non-negative integers.
