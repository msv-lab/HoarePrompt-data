Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima must walk to buy their cakes.

### Explanation of the Issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Movement**: The program attempts to compute the total distance by calculating distances for each tier separately in two distinct loops. However, it does not consider the fact that both Sasha and Dima are moving concurrently and that their movements should be optimized together, rather than calculating distances independently for each.

2. **Missing Coordination Between Sasha and Dima**: The problem description indicates that both Sasha and Dima can be at the same house at the same time and need to buy tiers in ascending order. The logic implemented only tracks the movement of one person at a time, which will not yield the minimum distance since it ignores the potential for one person to move to a tier while the other is already at a different tier.

3. **Sorting and Indexing**: The program sorts the tiers with their positions, but it does not take into account that after buying the first tier, both Sasha and Dima will have to make choices about which tier to go for next. This choice is critical for minimizing the total distance, but the current implementation does not account for this decision-making process.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
2
2 1 1 2
```
The expected minimum distance is 5, where one could go to house 2 for the first tier and then to house 1 (or vice versa), but the program does not correctly account for the best steps taken by both Sasha and Dima in coordination.

In conclusion, the program does not adhere to the problem requirements and therefore cannot guarantee the correct output for all valid inputs as specified by the problem description.
