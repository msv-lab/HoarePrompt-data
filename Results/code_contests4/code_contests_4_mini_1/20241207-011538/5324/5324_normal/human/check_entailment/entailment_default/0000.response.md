To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we analyze the functions and their output hints in context.

### Problem Description:
Sasha and Dima need to buy two n-tier cakes from 2n houses, each selling one specific tier size from 1 to n. They must purchase the tiers in ascending order, and we need to calculate the minimum total distance they need to walk.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function func_1**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
   - However, it is irrelevant to the problem of calculating the distance Sasha and Dima need to walk. It doesn't contribute to solving the core problem.

2. **Function func_2**:
   - This function reads the integer `n`, and a list of `2 * n` integers (the sizes of cake tiers available at each house).
   - It sorts these integers along with their original positions.
   - It calculates the total distance walked by Sasha and Dima as they pick up the tiers in the order from 1 to n.
   - The distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the current position and the position of the next required tier.

### Output Description for func_2:
- The output description correctly explains the functionality of func_2. It states that the function correctly calculates the total distance based on the positions of the integers in the sorted list.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- The code assumes that the input is always valid and that every tier size from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It does not handle cases where the input may not meet this criterion, but the problem guarantees this condition.
- Another potential edge case is the distance calculation when the positions of the tiers are not optimal. The function simply sums the distances without checking if there are more efficient paths, but given the constraints, it appears to be a valid approach.

### Output Hints Agreement:
- The output hints for func_2 align with the logic in the function. They state that the function calculates total distances correctly based on the positions of the tiers and their occurrences.
- The provided examples in the problem description also match the expected outputs when following the logic of the code.

### Conclusion:
The provided code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case as per the guarantees stated in the problem. The distance calculation logic appears sound, and no edge cases were found that the current implementation does not handle correctly.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the total distance Sasha and Dima need to walk to collect their cake tiers in ascending order.
