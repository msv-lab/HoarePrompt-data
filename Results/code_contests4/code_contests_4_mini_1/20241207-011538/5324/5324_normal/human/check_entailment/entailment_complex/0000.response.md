To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
Sasha and Dima need to buy two cakes with n tiers each, where each tier has a unique size from 1 to n, and they must buy the tiers in ascending order (1, 2, ..., n). They start at the leftmost house, and the function should calculate the minimum distance they have to walk to purchase both cakes.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. This is irrelevant to the problem at hand since the problem requires calculating distances, not GCDs.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input for `n` and the list of cake tier sizes.
   - It sorts the cake tiers together with their positions in a tuple.
   - Then it calculates the total distance walked by both Sasha and Dima based on their positions in the sorted list.

### Logic Flaws:
1. **Walking Distance Logic**:
   - The way distances are calculated for Sasha and Dima is not optimal. The code simply adds up the distances based on the sorted list of positions, which does not guarantee that the minimum total walking distance is achieved.
   - The code does not account for the fact that both Sasha and Dima can move simultaneously to different positions to minimize overall distance. The two loops seem to assume sequentially that Sasha and then Dima will always go to the next house in a predefined order without considering the best possible way to minimize walking distance.

2. **Missing Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where Sasha and Dima could reach their respective positions more efficiently by splitting the workload or considering overlaps in their paths. The problem explicitly allows both to start from the same house, which should be leveraged to find the minimum combined distance.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to account for optimal movement strategies for both Sasha and Dima. The annotations for `func_1` are irrelevant, and the annotations for `func_2` are misleading since they imply that the method used will always yield the correct minimum distance, which is not the case.

Therefore, the overall correctness of the program in relation to the problem description is:

Correctness: **False**

### Example of Failure:
For an input like:
```
3
1 2 1 3 2 3
```
The optimal sequence would involve both Sasha and Dima picking tiers in a way that minimizes distance, rather than going strictly by the sorted positions. The naive approach in `func_2` will lead to suboptimal distances being calculated.
