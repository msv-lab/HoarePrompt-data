You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sasha and Dima want to buy two n-tier cakes. Each cake should consist of n different tiers: from the size of 1 to the size of n. Tiers should go in order from the smallest to the biggest (from top to bottom).

They live on the same street, there are 2 ⋅ n houses in a row from left to right. Each house has a pastry shop where you can buy a cake tier. Unfortunately, in each pastry shop you can buy only one tier of only one specific size: in the i-th house you can buy a tier of the size a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).

Since the guys carry already purchased tiers, and it is impossible to insert a new tier in the middle of the cake, they agreed to buy tiers from the smallest to the biggest. That is, each of them buys tiers in order: 1, then 2, then 3 and so on up to n.

Initially, Sasha and Dima are located near the first (leftmost) house. Output the minimum distance that they will have to walk in total to buy both cakes. The distance between any two neighboring houses is exactly 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer number n — the number of tiers in each cake (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains 2 ⋅ n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where a_i is equal to the size of the tier, which can be bought in the i-th house. Remember that in each house you can buy only one tier. It is guaranteed that every number from 1 to n occurs in a exactly two times.

Output

Print one number — the minimum distance that the guys have to walk in total to buy both cakes. Guys can be near same house at the same time. They begin near the first (leftmost) house. Each of the guys should buy n tiers in ascending order of their sizes.

Note

In the first example, the possible optimal sequence of actions is:

  * Sasha buys a tier of size 1 near the 1-st house (a_1=1); 
  * Dima goes to the house 2; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 1 near the 2-nd house (a_2=1); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 4; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 2 near the 4-th house (a_4=2); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 5; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 3 near the 5-th house (a_5=3); 
  * Dima goes to the house 3; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 2 near the 3-rd house (a_3=2); 
  * Dima goes to the house 6; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 3 near the 6-th house (a_6=3). 



So, Sasha goes the distance 3+1=4, and Dima goes the distance 1+1+3=5. In total, they cover a distance of 4+5=9. You can make sure that with any other sequence of actions they will walk no less distance.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of 2 * n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and every number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the list.
def func_1(x, y):
    """greatest common divisor of x and y"""
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, where y is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x`, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of GCD. The GCD is computed using the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` and `y` with `y` and `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. The function does not handle cases where `x` or `y` are negative, which can lead to unexpected results as GCD is typically defined only for non-negative integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and a is a list of 2 * n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice in the list.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(zip(map(int, input().split()), range(1, 2 * n + 1)))
    dist = 0
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i][1]
        
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        
        prev = pos
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `dist` is the total distance computed as the accumulated sum of absolute differences, `prev` is equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`, `pos` is equal to `a[2 * (n - 1)][1]`.
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i + 1][1]
        
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        
        prev = pos
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `dist` is the total distance computed as the accumulated sum of absolute differences, `prev` is `a[2 * (n - 1) + 1][1]`, `pos` is `a[2 * (n - 1) + 1][1]`.
    print(dist)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `2 * n` integers, where each integer in the range from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It calculates the total distance based on the positions of these integers in the sorted list, by summing the absolute differences between consecutive positions of both the first and second occurrences of each integer, and then prints this total distance.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
