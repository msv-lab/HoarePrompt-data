To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task requires determining the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima need to walk to purchase two cakes with tiers from size 1 to n, while ensuring that they buy the tiers in ascending order. Each tier size appears twice in the list of houses.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the tier sizes available in the houses. It sorts this list of tuples (tier size, house position).

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distance for Sasha to collect the first tier (even-indexed positions in the sorted list) and updates the previous position.
   - It then calculates the distance for Dima to collect the second tier (odd-indexed positions in the sorted list) in a similar manner.

3. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total distance.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Assumption on Initial Positions**: The program assumes that both Sasha and Dima start at the first house (position 1). However, the initial position of each person is not clearly defined in the program. They could theoretically start at the same position or at different positions.

2. **Order of Picking Tiers**: The program does not account for the scenario where it might be more optimal for both Sasha and Dima to pick different tiers in a different order to minimize walking distance. The greedy approach used may not yield the minimum distance in all cases.

### Example Case that Fails:
Consider the following case:
```
Input:
3
1 2 1 3 3 2
```
Expected Output:
The optimal sequence could be:
- Sasha moves to house 1 (size 1), Dima moves to house 2 (size 1).
- Sasha moves to house 3 (size 2), Dima moves to house 6 (size 2).
- Sasha moves to house 5 (size 3), Dima moves to house 4 (size 3).

Total distance = 0 (house 1) + 1 (to house 2) + 2 (to house 3) + 3 (to house 6) + 1 (to house 5) + 1 (to house 4) = 8.

However, the program's logic will not guarantee the minimal movement as it just follows the sorted order without considering the optimal path for both individuals.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not guarantee the optimal walking distance due to its greedy nature and assumptions about starting positions, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
