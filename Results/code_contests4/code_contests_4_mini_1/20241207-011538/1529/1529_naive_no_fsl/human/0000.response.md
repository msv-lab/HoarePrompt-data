To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The problem states that we are given four integers, which represent the pairwise sums of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and the total sum \(a + b + c\). The program is supposed to deduce the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from these values.

The program takes the following steps:
1. It reads four integers from input.
2. It sorts these integers.
3. It then calculates \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the formula:
   - \(a = (a + b + c) - (b + c)\)
   - \(b = (a + b + c) - (a + c)\)
   - \(c = (a + b + c) - (a + b)\)

In the code, this is implemented as:
```python
numbers[3] - numbers[0]
numbers[3] - numbers[1]
numbers[3] - numbers[2]
```

After sorting, `numbers[3]` will always be the total sum \(a + b + c\), while `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, and `numbers[2]` will correspond to the pairwise sums \(a + b\), \(a + c\), and \(b + c\) in some order.

Letâ€™s check if the logic holds for a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** Input: `3 6 5 4`
   - Sorted input: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`
   - Calculate:
     - \(a = 6 - 3 = 3\)
     - \(b = 6 - 4 = 2\)
     - \(c = 6 - 5 = 1\)
   - Output: `3 2 1` (Correct based on \(a + b + c = 6\))

2. **Test Case 2:** Input: `40 40 40 60`
   - Sorted input: `[40, 40, 40, 60]`
   - Calculate:
     - \(a = 60 - 40 = 20\)
     - \(b = 60 - 40 = 20\)
     - \(c = 60 - 40 = 20\)
   - Output: `20 20 20` (Correct based on \(a + b + c = 60\))

3. **Test Case 3:** Input: `201 101 101 200`
   - Sorted input: `[101, 101, 200, 201]`
   - Calculate:
     - \(a = 201 - 101 = 100\)
     - \(b = 201 - 101 = 100\)
     - \(c = 201 - 200 = 1\)
   - Output: `100 100 1` (Correct based on \(a + b + c = 201\))

Now, consider edge cases:
- What if all inputs are the same? For example, `2 2 2 2`.
  - Sorted input: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
  - Calculate:
    - \(a = 2 - 2 = 0\) (Invalid since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be positive integers)
  
This shows that the program does not correctly handle all cases because it can produce a non-positive integer for \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) when all inputs are the same.

Thus, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
