The function `func` accepts four parameters: `x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer constrained such that \(2 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\). The function processes these parameters and produces an output. However, the specific output or conditions based on the values of these parameters are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept four positive integers within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts four positive integers x_1, x_2, x_3, and x_4, each within the range of 2 to 10^9.**
