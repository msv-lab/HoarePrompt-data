Functionality: ** The function accepts four positive integers from user input, sorts them, and prints the differences between the largest integer and each of the three smaller integers. Specifically, it returns the differences between the largest number and the second, third, and fourth largest numbers, respectively. It does not explicitly handle cases where fewer or more than four integers are provided. **
