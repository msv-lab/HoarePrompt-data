The `numbers` list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4`, which are positive integers within the range of 2 to 10^9, will be rearranged in such a way that the smallest value comes first and the largest value comes last. The specific order of the integers will depend on their original arrangement. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorted state of the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`, and `x_4` are sorted in ascending order within the list `numbers`.**
