The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description.

### Explanation of the Program:
1. The program reads four integers from input, representing the four numbers written on the board.
2. It sorts these integers.
3. It calculates and prints the differences between the largest integer (the sum of all three integers, `a + b + c`) and the three smaller integers.

### Analysis Based on the Problem Description:
The problem requires the program to output three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that:
- The four numbers on the board correspond to the pairwise sums (`a + b`, `a + c`, `b + c`) and the total sum (`a + b + c`).

### Issues with the Program:
- The program only computes the differences between the largest number and the other three numbers, which does not correspond to the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as required by the problem description.
- It prints the values derived from the differences (`numbers[3] - numbers[0]`, `numbers[3] - numbers[1]`, `numbers[3] - numbers[2]`), which does not directly yield the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- The output does not guarantee that the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` will always be positive integers nor does it ensure they are the correct integers that generate the four sums.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly derive the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the provided sums, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
