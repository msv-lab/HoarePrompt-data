You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp has guessed three positive integers a, b and c. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: a+b, a+c, b+c and a+b+c.

You have to guess three numbers a, b and c using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.

Pay attention that some given numbers a, b and c can be equal (it is also possible that a=b=c).

Input

The only line of the input contains four positive integers x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 (2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) — numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4.

Output

Print such positive integers a, b and c that four numbers written on a board are values a+b, a+c, b+c and a+b+c written in some order. Print a, b and c in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x_1, x_2, x_3, and x_4 are four positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    numbers = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    numbers.sort()
    print('{0} {1} {2}'.format(numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1],
    numbers[3] - numbers[2]))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four positive integers from user input, sorts them, and prints the differences between the largest integer and each of the three smaller integers. Specifically, it returns the differences between the largest number and the second, third, and fourth largest numbers, respectively. It does not explicitly handle cases where fewer or more than four integers are provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
