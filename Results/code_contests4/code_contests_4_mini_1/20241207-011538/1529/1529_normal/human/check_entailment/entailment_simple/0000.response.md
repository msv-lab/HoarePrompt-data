To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and how it processes the input.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarp has three hidden integers \( a, b, c \) and has written down four numbers:
1. The pairwise sums: \( a+b, a+c, b+c \)
2. The total sum: \( a+b+c \)

The task is to derive the integers \( a, b, \) and \( c \) from these four sums.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads four integers, sorts them, and then calculates the three integers \( a, b, c \) using the following logic:
```python
print('{0} {1} {2}'.format(numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1], numbers[3] - numbers[2]))
```
Here, `numbers[3]` is the maximum number among the four (which is \( a+b+c \)), and `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, and `numbers[2]` are the three pairwise sums in sorted order.

#### Derivation of \( a, b, c \):
- \( a = (a+b+c) - (b+c) = numbers[3] - numbers[2] \)
- \( b = (a+b+c) - (a+c) = numbers[3] - numbers[1] \)
- \( c = (a+b+c) - (a+b) = numbers[3] - numbers[0] \)

### Correctness Check:
1. **Input Validity**: The program only expects four positive integers, which aligns with the input constraints.
2. **Output**: The program outputs three integers derived from the sums, which can be equal, and it correctly uses the maximum sum to derive the individual integers.
3. **Guaranteed Existence of a Solution**: The problem guarantees that a solution exists, and the logic used in the program correctly identifies \( a, b, \) and \( c \) based on the sorted sums.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to extract the integers \( a, b, \) and \( c \) from the given sums. Thus, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
