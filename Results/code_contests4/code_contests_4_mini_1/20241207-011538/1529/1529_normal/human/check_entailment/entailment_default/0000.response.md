To assess the correctness of the provided program, we start by analyzing both the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to deduce three positive integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from four numbers that represent their pairwise sums and the total sum \( a + b + c \). The input consists of four numbers, and the output should be the three integers.

**Program:**
```python
numbers = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
numbers.sort()
print('{0} {1} {2}'.format(numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1], numbers[3] - numbers[2]))
```

**Initial Assessment of the Code:**
1. The code reads four integers and sorts them.
2. It calculates the differences between the largest integer (which should be \( a + b + c \)) and the three smaller integers (which correspond to the pairwise sums).
3. The output is formatted to print these three values.

**Edge Cases:**
- If we consider the input where all four numbers are equal, such as \( 40, 40, 40, 60 \), the program will output \( 20, 20, 20 \), which is correct as it reflects \( a = 20, b = 20, c = 20 \).
- For inputs like \( 3, 6, 5, 4 \), the output will be \( 2, 1, 3 \), which corresponds to \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 \) and is also correct.
- However, if given numbers do not adhere to being positive integers or do not satisfy the assumption of being the sums, the logic might fail, but the problem guarantees that the answer exists.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints mention that the function calculates differences based on sorting. This aligns with the logic of the code. The hints do not provide contradictory information regarding the operation of the code.

**Final Conclusion:**
After analyzing the provided code against the problem description and considering the output hints, the code appears to handle the requirements of the problem correctly. The output for the given examples aligns with the requirements and guarantees provided.

Thus, I find no edge cases or examples where the code does not work as expected according to the description.

Correctness: **True**.
