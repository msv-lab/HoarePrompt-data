To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to understand the requirements:

1. We are given four positive integers which represent the pairwise sums of three hidden integers (a, b, c) and the total sum of those integers (a+b+c).
2. We need to deduce the original integers a, b, and c from the provided sums.

Let's dissect the program:

```python
numbers = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
numbers.sort()
print('{0} {1} {2}'.format(numbers[3] - numbers[0], numbers[3] - numbers[1], numbers[3] - numbers[2]))
```

- The program reads four integers, stores them in a list, and sorts them.
- It then calculates the integers a, b, and c using the formula:
  - a = (a+b+c) - (b+c) = total - second largest
  - b = (a+b+c) - (a+c) = total - largest
  - c = (a+b+c) - (a+b) = total - smallest
  
The indices used for operation are:
- `numbers[3]` refers to the largest value (a+b+c)
- `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, and `numbers[2]` refer to the smallest, second smallest, and second largest values, respectively.

This approach is sound mathematically and logically. However, we need to check if it handles all potential edge cases correctly.

### Potential Edge Cases:
Let's consider cases where some numbers might be equal:
1. Input: `3 3 3 6`
   - The expected output is `1 1 1` since `1+1 = 2`, `1+1 = 2`, `1+1 = 2`, and `1+1+1 = 3`
   - The program would return `0 0 0`, which is incorrect as it doesn't output positive integers.
  
2. Input: `2 2 2 4`
   - The expected output is `1 1 1`.
   - The program would also return `0 0 0`, which again does not satisfy positivity.

The program does not account for the requirement that a, b, and c must be positive integers. It is possible to derive outputs where the values are zero or negative, which is invalid for the problem constraints.

Thus, we have found potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
