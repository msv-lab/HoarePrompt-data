The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, calculates the XOR of these integers, and then processes the binary representation of the XOR result to count how many significant '1's can be matched with the counts of the most significant bits from the list. If the XOR is zero, it outputs `0`. If there are significant '1's in the XOR that cannot be matched with the counts, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the total count of matched '1's.
