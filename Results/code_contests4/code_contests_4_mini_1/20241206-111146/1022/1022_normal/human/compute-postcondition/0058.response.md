The statement `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` updates the `cnt` array at the index `lb - 1 - j`. Given that `j` is `lb - 3`, we can substitute `j` in the index calculation:

- The index becomes `lb - 1 - (lb - 3)`.
- Simplifying this gives us `lb - 1 - lb + 3`, which simplifies to `2`.

Therefore, `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt[2]` is not specified, but it may have been incremented at most once before.

The other variables `bit`, `lb`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `lb - 3`, `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1.**
