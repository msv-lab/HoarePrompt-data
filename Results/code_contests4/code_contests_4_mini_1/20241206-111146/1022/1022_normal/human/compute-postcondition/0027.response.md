Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than or equal to 0; if there is at least one '1' in `bit`, then `cnt[k]` is incremented by 1 for the highest index `k` corresponding to the position of the most significant '1' in `bit`, while the rest of the elements in `cnt` remain unchanged. If `bit` consists only of '0's, then `cnt` remains unchanged.**
