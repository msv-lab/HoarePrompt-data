The variable `axor` is assigned the value `int(axor, 2) ^ tmp`. The value of `axor` is converted from a binary string to an integer and then XORed with the value of `tmp`. 

Since `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`, it represents a binary number consisting of `(la - i - 1)` ones. Therefore, the value of `tmp` is `2^(la - i - 1) - 1`.

The result of the XOR operation depends on the specific values of `axor` and `tmp`. However, we know that `axor` is modified by this operation. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 1; `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`; `axor` is modified by XORing with `tmp`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 1; `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`; `axor` is modified by XORing with `tmp`.**
