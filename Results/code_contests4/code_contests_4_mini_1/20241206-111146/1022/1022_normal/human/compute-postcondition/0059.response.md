The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `lb - 3`, `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
