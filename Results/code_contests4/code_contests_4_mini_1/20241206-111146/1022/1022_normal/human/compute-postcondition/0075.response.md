The value of `axor` is converted to its binary representation (excluding the '0b' prefix) using the `bin()` function. The previous value of `axor` is not specified, but it is a non-negative integer. The state of `N`, `n`, and `i` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is now a binary string; `i` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is now a binary string; `i` is equal to `n**
