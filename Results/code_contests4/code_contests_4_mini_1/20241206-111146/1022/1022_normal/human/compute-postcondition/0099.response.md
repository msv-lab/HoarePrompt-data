The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 0; -1 is printed, and the program terminates.
