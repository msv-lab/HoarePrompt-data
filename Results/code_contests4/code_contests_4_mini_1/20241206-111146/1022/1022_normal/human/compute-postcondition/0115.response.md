The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1; `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
