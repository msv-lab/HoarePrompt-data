Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, and `n` is a non-negative integer. If `axor[i]` is '1' and `cnt[i]` is 0, the program prints -1 and terminates. Otherwise, `la` is an integer, `i` is an integer that has been increased by 1, `tmp` is calculated as 2^(la - i - 1) - 1, and `axor` is updated to be the binary string representation of its previous integer value.***
