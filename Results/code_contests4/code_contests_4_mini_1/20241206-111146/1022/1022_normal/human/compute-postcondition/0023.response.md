According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j`. The loop condition allows `j` to iterate from `lb - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `lb - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented to `lb - 3`. 

Additionally, the loop can continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. As such, it is necessary that `lb` is greater than `2` to ensure that `j` can be `lb - 3` and still remain valid.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than 2; `j` is `lb - 3`.**
