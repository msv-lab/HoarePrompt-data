The `axor` variable, which is currently in some integer form, is being converted to its binary representation using the `bin()` function. The `[2:]` slice removes the '0b' prefix that indicates a binary number in Python. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 1; `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1; `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`; `axor` is now the binary string representation of the previous `axor`.**
