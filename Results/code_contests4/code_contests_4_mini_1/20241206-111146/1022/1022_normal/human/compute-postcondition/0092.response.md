The value of `axor` is updated using a bitwise XOR operation with `tmp`. The variable `tmp` is equal to `2^(la - 1) - 1`, which represents a binary number with `la - 1` ones. The previous value of `axor` is a binary string that is converted to an integer before the operation. Since the character at index `i` of `axor` is '1', and `cnt[i]` is now `cnt[i] - 1`, the value at index `i` does not directly affect the calculation of `axor`, but it indicates that there was a previously counted occurrence of '1' at that index. The output state reflects the updated integer value of `axor`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is updated; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 1; the character at index `i` of `axor` is '1'; `cnt[i]` is now `cnt[i] - 1`; `tmp` is equal to `2^(la - 1) - 1.**
