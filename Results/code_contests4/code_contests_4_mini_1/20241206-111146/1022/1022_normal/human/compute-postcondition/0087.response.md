The value of `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1. Since `cnt[i]` is greater than 0, the new value of `cnt[i]` will be `cnt[i] - 1`, which is now still non-negative. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is a binary string; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 1; the character at index `i` of `axor` is '1'; `cnt[i]` is now `cnt[i] - 1`.
