In this code, `tmp` is assigned the value of the binary number represented by a string of '1's of length `(la - i - 1)`, converted to an integer. The variables `la`, `i`, and `tmp` are directly impacted by this computation. Since `la` and `i` are not specified but are expected to conform to the given conditions (with `N` being a positive integer), we can analyze the outcome.

The expression `(la - i - 1)` calculates the length of the string of '1's. The value of `tmp` will be `2^(la - i - 1) - 1`, since a string of `k` '1's in binary equals `2^k - 1`.

For the output state, we observe that `N` is a positive integer, and the other variables could be adjusted according to the conditions provided. However, without specific values for `la` and `i`, we cannot determine an exact numerical value for `tmp`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between the variables:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `la` is an integer; `i` is an integer; `tmp` is calculated as 2^(la - i - 1) - 1.**
