The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000, the value of `n` will also be a positive integer in the same range. The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a positive integer in the same range**.
