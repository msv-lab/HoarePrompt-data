The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs -1. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; printed output is -1**
