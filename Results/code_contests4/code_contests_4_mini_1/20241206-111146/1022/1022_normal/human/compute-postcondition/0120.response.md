Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5 and `n` is a non-negative integer. If `cnt[i]` is 0, the program prints -1 and terminates. Otherwise, `la` is an integer, `i` is an integer, `tmp` is calculated as 2^(la - i - 1) - 1, and `axor` is now a binary string representation of the previous integer value of `axor`.***
