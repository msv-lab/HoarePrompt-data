Postcondition: ***`bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is `lb - 3`. If `bit[j]` is '1', then `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `bit[j]` is not '1', no changes are made to `cnt[2]` or the program state.***
