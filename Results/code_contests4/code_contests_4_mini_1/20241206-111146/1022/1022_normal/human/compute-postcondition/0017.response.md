The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than 0; `j` is `lb - 1`; and the value at `cnt[0]` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
