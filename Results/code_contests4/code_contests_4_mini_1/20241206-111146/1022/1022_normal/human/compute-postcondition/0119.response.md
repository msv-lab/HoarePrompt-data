To understand the impact of the code snippet, let's analyze it step by step:

1. The variable `axor` is being converted to its binary string representation using `bin(axor)[2:]`, which removes the '0b' prefix that Python adds to binary strings.
2. The previous value of `axor` (before this line of code executes) is not specified, but we know it is an integer.
3. After executing this line, `axor` will now hold a string representation of its binary form.

Since the initial state does not specify the previous value of `axor`, we can only state that `axor` has been converted to a binary string.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `la` is an integer; `i` is an integer; `tmp` is calculated as 2^(la - i - 1) - 1; `axor` is now a binary string representation of the previous integer value of `axor`.**
