According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `lb - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to `lb - 2`. 

Additionally, the loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `j >= 0` holds true. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `lb` must be greater than or equal to 2 (since `j` starts at `lb - 1` and must be at least 0).

State: **`bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `lb - 2`, and `cnt` may have been incremented at most once.**
