To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet:

1. The variable `axor` is being modified by applying the XOR operation with `tmp`.
2. The value of `tmp` is calculated as `2^(la - i - 1) - 1`, but since we don't have specific values for `la` and `i`, we will represent `tmp` in terms of these variables.
3. The `int(axor, 2)` converts the binary string `axor` into an integer. 

Given the initial state:

- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5
- `la` is an integer
- `i` is an integer
- `tmp` is calculated as `2^(la - i - 1) - 1`

The final value of `axor` will be the result of the XOR operation between the integer representation of `axor` and `tmp`. However, since we do not have the initial value of `axor`, we cannot provide a specific output for it, only the general form.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes and variables involved without specific numeric values for `axor`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `la` is an integer; `i` is an integer; `tmp` is calculated as 2^(la - i - 1) - 1; `axor` is updated to int(axor, 2) ^ tmp.**
