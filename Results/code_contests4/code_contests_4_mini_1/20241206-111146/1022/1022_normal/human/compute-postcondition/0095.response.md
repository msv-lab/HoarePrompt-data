Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 0. If `axor[i]` is '1' and `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, the value -1 is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `tmp` is equal to `2^(la - 1) - 1`, and `axor` is updated to its new binary string representation with `la` being updated to the length of the new binary string. If `axor[i]` is not '1', the state of the program remains unchanged.***
