The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `N`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; and `ans` is increased by 1.**
