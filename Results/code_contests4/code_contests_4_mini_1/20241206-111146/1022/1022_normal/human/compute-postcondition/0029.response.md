Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than or equal to 0; `cnt` remains unchanged if `bit` consists only of '0's, or `cnt[k]` is incremented by 1 for the highest index `k` corresponding to the position of the most significant '1' in `bit` if there is at least one '1' in `bit`.**
