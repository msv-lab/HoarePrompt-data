Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; if `cnt[i]` is 0, -1 is printed and the program terminates. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1, `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)`, and `axor` is updated to the binary string representation of the previous `axor`.***
