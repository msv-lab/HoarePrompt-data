Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than 0; `j` is `lb - 1`. If the bit at index `j` is '1', the value at `cnt[0]` is increased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
