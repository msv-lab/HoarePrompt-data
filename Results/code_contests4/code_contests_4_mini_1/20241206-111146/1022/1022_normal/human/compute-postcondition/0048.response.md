According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `lb`. The loop will execute if `lb` is at least 1, as the loop starts at `lb - 1` and decrements down to 0. If `lb` is 0, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `lb` must be greater than 0. 

At the beginning of the loop, `j` should be initialized to `lb - 1`, which is the last index of the binary representation of `a[i]`. 

State: **`bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 1`, and `cnt` may have been incremented at most once**
