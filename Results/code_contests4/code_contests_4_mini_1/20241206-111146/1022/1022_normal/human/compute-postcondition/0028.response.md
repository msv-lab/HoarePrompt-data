According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Hence, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than or equal to 0; if there is at least one '1' in `bit`, then `cnt[k]` is incremented by 1 for the highest index `k` corresponding to the position of the most significant '1' in `bit`, while the rest of the elements in `cnt` remain unchanged. If `bit` consists only of '0's, then `cnt` remains unchanged.**
