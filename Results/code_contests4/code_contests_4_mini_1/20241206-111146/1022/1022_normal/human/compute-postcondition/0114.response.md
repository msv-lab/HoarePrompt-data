The operation `cnt[i] -= 1` decreases the value at index `i` of the array (or list) `cnt` by 1. The previous values of `cnt` at index `i` are not specified, but it is assumed that `cnt[i]` is a non-negative integer since `n` is a non-negative integer and typically, counts are non-negative. 

After the operation, the value of `cnt[i]` will be one less than its previous value. The variables `N`, `n`, and `ans` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1; `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1; `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1.**
