The code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increments the value at the index `lb - 1 - j` of the array `cnt` by 1. Since `j` is defined as `lb - 2`, we can substitute that into the expression. Therefore, the index being modified is `lb - 1 - (lb - 2)`, which simplifies to `1`. 

Assuming `cnt` is an array of integers initialized to some values (not specified in the initial state), the effect of this operation is to increment `cnt[1]` by 1. The values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `bit`, `lb`, and `j` remain unchanged, so they do not affect the output state.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than 0; `j` is `lb - 2`; `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.**
