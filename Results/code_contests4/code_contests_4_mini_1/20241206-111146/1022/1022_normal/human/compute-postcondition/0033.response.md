The value of `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1, where `lb` is at least 1 and the j-th bit of `bit` is '1'. `cnt` remains unchanged except for the specific index `lb - 1 - j`. The previous values of the other variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `cnt`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]`, `lb` is at least 1, and `cnt` is updated at index `lb - 1 - j` by incrementing its value by 1.**
