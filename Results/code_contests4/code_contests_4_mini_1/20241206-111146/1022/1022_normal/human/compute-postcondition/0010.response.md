The statement initializes a list `cnt` with a size of `mxlba + 5`, and all elements in the list are set to 0. The previous values of `N`, `n`, and `mxlba` do not affect the outcome of this initialization apart from determining the size of the list. Hence, `cnt` is created, and its size is dependent on the value of `mxlba`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is a non-negative integer, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of the integers in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of size `mxlba + 5` initialized to all 0s.**
