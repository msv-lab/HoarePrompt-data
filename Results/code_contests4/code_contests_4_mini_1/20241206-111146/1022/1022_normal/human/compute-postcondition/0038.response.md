The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]`, `lb` is at least 2, `cnt` is unchanged except `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
