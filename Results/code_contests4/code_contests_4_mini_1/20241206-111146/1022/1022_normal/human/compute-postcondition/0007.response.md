According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, which means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mxlba` is max(previous_mxlba, len(bin(a[i])[2:]))**
