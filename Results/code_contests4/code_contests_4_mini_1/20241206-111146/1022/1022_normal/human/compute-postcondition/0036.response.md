According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop iterates from `lb - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is currently at its starting value of `lb - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be decremented. 

Since the loop runs while `j` is greater than or equal to `0`, and the current value of `j` is `lb - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `lb - 2` (after decrement). Thus, `lb` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]`, `lb` is at least 2, and `cnt` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be `lb - 2`.**
