Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]`, `lb` is at least 2, `j` is `lb - 2`, and if `bit[j]` is '1', then `cnt` is unchanged except `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement. If `bit[j]` is not '1', the state of the program remains unchanged.***
