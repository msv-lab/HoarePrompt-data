The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 1; `cnt[i]` is decremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
