The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` to the console. The values of other variables remain unchanged as the code only performs a print operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is a binary string; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 0; the character at index `i` of `axor` is '1'; and `cnt[i]` is equal to 0; and the value -1 is printed.
