Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than 0; `j` is `lb - 2`. If `bit[j]` is '1', `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
