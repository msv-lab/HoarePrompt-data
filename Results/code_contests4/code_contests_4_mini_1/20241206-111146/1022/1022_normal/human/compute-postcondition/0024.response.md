The value of `j` is `lb - 3`, so `lb - 1 - j` simplifies to `lb - 1 - (lb - 3)` which equals `2`. Therefore, `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables do not change aside from `cnt`. The specifics of `cnt` are not provided, but its value at index 2 is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than 2; `j` is `lb - 3`; `cnt[2]` is incremented by 1.**
