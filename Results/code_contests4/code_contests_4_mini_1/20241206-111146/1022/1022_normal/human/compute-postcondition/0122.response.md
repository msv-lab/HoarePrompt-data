Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the original binary string `axor`, `la` is equal to the length of the final binary string representation of `axor`, `ans` is equal to the count of '1's processed in the binary string, `cnt` has been decremented according to the number of '1's encountered in `axor`. If all '1's in `axor` had corresponding non-zero counts in `cnt`, the loop executed fully; otherwise, the program printed -1 and terminated before completion.**
