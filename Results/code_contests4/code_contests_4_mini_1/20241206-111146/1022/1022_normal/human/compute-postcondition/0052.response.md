Postcondition: ***`bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 1`, and `cnt` may have been incremented at most once. If the j-th bit of `bit` is '1', then `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
