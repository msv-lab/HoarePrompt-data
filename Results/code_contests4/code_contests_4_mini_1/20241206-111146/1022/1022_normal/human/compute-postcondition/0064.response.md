According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates `n` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `N` is a positive integer and can be up to 10^5, it does not impact the loop execution directly unless it affects `n`. The other variables `cnt` and `axor` do not influence the ability of the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, `i` should start at 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
