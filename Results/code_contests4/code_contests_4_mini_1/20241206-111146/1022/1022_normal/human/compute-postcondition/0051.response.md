The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than 0, `j` is `lb - 1`, `cnt` may have been incremented at most once, and the j-th bit of `bit` is '1'; `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
