Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is a binary string; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 1; the character at index `i` of `axor` is '1'; `cnt[i]` is now `cnt[i] - 1`. If `la - i - 1` is equal to 0, indicating that `i` is the last index of `axor`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
