The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the termination occurs. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is increased by 1; printed output is -1, and the program has terminated.
