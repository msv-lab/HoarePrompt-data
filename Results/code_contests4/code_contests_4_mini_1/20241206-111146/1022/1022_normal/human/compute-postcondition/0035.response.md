Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]`, `lb` is at least 1, and `cnt` remains unchanged. If `bit[j]` is '1', the value of `cnt` at index `lb - 1 - j` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
