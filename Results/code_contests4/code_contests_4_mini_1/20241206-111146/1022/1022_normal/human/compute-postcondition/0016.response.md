The code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` modifies the `cnt` array by incrementing the value at the index `lb - 1 - j`. The value of `j` is given as `lb - 1`, so the expression simplifies to `cnt[0] += 1` since `lb - 1 - j` equals `0`. 

Since `cnt` is an array and its previous value at index `0` is unknown, we can only state that the value at this index is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]` without the '0b' prefix; `lb` is greater than 0; `j` is `lb - 1`; and the value at `cnt[0]` is increased by 1.
