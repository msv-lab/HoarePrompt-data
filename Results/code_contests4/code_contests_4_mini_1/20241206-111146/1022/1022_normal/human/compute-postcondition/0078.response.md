The value of `i` is assigned -1, which changes its previous value (which was equal to `n`, a non-negative integer). The other variables (`N`, `n`, `axor`, `la`, `ans`) remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is now a binary string; `i` is -1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is now a binary string; `i` is -1; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 0.**
