The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `lb - 2`, `cnt` may have been incremented at most once; `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
