`lb` is assigned the value of `len(bit)`, which calculates the length of the string `bit`. The value of `bit` affects `lb`, while `cnt` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, and `cnt` may have been incremented at most once.

Output State: **`bit` is the binary representation of `a[i]`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, `cnt` may have been incremented at most once.**
