The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, there are no changes to the values of any variables, but the program exits. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is a binary string; `i` is 0; `la` is the length of the binary string `axor`; `ans` is 0; the character at index `i` of `axor` is '1'; and `cnt[i]` is equal to 0; the value -1 is printed, and the program exits.
