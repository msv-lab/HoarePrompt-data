The statement `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` modifies the `cnt` array at the index `lb - 1 - j`. Given that `j` is `lb - 2`, we can substitute that in:

- `lb - 1 - j` becomes `lb - 1 - (lb - 2)`, which simplifies to `1`.

Thus, the code increments `cnt[1]` by 1. The previous state of `cnt` is unchanged except for `cnt[1]`, which was previously modified (incremented by 1 if `bit[j]` is '1').

The output state reflects that `cnt[1]` has now been incremented again, but we do not have the exact initial values of `cnt` or `cnt[1]` specifically, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `bit` is the binary representation of `a[1]`, `lb` is at least 2, `j` is `lb - 2`, `cnt` is unchanged except `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
