You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A cheetah and a cheater are going to play the game of Nim. In this game they use N piles of stones. Initially the i-th pile contains a_i stones. The players take turns alternately, and the cheetah plays first. In each turn, the player chooses one of the piles, and takes one or more stones from the pile. The player who can't make a move loses.

However, before the game starts, the cheater wants to cheat a bit to make sure that he can win regardless of the moves by the cheetah. From each pile, the cheater takes zero or one stone and eats it before the game. In case there are multiple ways to guarantee his winning, he wants to minimize the number of stones he eats.

Compute the number of stones the cheater will eat. In case there is no way for the cheater to win the game even with the cheating, print `-1` instead.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and a_i are integers such that 2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile i from 1 to N.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = [int(raw_input()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    mxlba = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        mxlba = max(mxlba, len(bin(a[i])[2:]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `n` is a non-negative integer, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of the integers in list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers.
    cnt = [0] * (mxlba + 5)
    for i in xrange(n):
        bit = bin(a[i])[2:]
        
        lb = len(bit)
        
        for j in xrange(lb - 1, -1, -1):
            if bit[j] == '1':
                cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `cnt` contains counts of the most significant '1' bits of the integers in list `a`, or remains unchanged if all integers are zero.
    axor = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        axor ^= a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is the XOR of the first `n` elements of list `a`; `i` is equal to `n`.
    if (axor == 0) :
        print(0)
        exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `n` is a non-negative integer; `axor` is the XOR of the first `n` elements of list `a`; `i` is equal to `n`. If `axor` is 0, the output is 0 and the program exits.
    axor = bin(axor)[2:]
    la = len(axor)
    ans = 0
    i = -1
    while i < la:
        i += 1
        
        if axor[i] == '1':
            if cnt[i] == 0:
                print(-1)
                exit()
            else:
                ans += 1
                cnt[i] -= 1
                if la - i - 1 == 0:
                    break
                tmp = int('1' * (la - i - 1), 2)
                axor = int(axor, 2) ^ tmp
                axor = bin(axor)[2:]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of the original binary string `axor`, `la` is equal to the length of the final binary string representation of `axor`, `ans` is equal to the count of '1's processed in the binary string, `cnt` has been decremented according to the number of '1's encountered in `axor`. If all '1's in `axor` had corresponding non-zero counts in `cnt`, the loop executed fully; otherwise, the program printed -1 and terminated before completion.
    print(ans)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
