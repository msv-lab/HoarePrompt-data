Correctness: **True**.

The provided program reads input pairs of words and page numbers, stores them in a dictionary (using `defaultdict` for automatic list creation), and then outputs the words in alphabetical order along with their corresponding page numbers in ascending order. 

- It correctly handles multiple entries for the same word by appending page numbers to a list.
- The use of `sorted` ensures that both the words and the page numbers are printed in the required order.
- The program structure allows for processing input until the end, which adheres to the problem's output requirements.

Since it meets all the specified requirements and handles the inputs as described, I cannot find any potential cases where it would fail. Thus, the program is correct.
