To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, we will analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to read pairs of words and page numbers, store them, and print each word in alphabetical order with its corresponding page numbers in ascending order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Processing**: The program uses `stdin` to read input lines until EOF, which is appropriate for the given task.
2. **Data Storage**: It employs a `defaultdict` to map words to lists of page numbers. This is suitable since words can appear multiple times with different page numbers.
3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the words alphabetically.
   - It sorts the page numbers associated with each word before printing.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Empty Input**: If no input is provided, the program should not crash. It should simply produce no output.
- **Single Word Entry**: The program should correctly handle a case where only one word and one page number pair is provided.
- **Duplicate Words**: The program should correctly accumulate page numbers if the same word appears multiple times with different page numbers.
- **Maximum Limits**: The program should be able to handle the maximum constraints defined in the problem descriptionâ€”100 pairs of words and page numbers.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints specify that the function processes pairs of words and output them in order. They also confirm that:
- The words are printed in alphabetical order.
- The page numbers are printed in ascending order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle the problem requirements correctly based on the description and output hints. 

However, there is a potential concern regarding the handling of input and output when no data is provided. The problem description does not specify what should happen in such a case, but since the program doesn't crash and simply produces no output, it can be considered acceptable behavior.

### Final Assessment:
The code correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement, handles various edge cases appropriately, and the output hints agree with its behavior.

Correctness: **True**.
