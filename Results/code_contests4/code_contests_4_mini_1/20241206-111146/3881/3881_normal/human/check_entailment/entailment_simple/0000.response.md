Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description. The input is expected to be pairs of a word and a page number, followed by a termination signal (represented by "::"). However, the program does not incorporate any logic to stop reading input upon encountering the "::" signal. Instead, it continues to read from `stdin`, which would lead to an infinite loop or an error when it encounters input that doesn't match the expected format.

Additionally, the program assumes that the input will always be provided correctly without any validation, which is not aligned with robust programming practices. The problem description implies that the program should only process valid pairs of word and page number until the termination signal is reached.

Thus, due to the lack of handling for the termination signal and the potential for incorrect input processing, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
