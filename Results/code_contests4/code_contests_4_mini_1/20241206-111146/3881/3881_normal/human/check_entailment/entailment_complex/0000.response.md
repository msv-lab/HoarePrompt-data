Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it meets all the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads pairs of words and page numbers from standard input. It assumes the input format is correct as per the problem description, where each word is followed by a page number.

2. **Data Structure**: It uses a `defaultdict` of lists to store the words as keys and their corresponding page numbers as a list of integers. This structure allows for multiple page numbers to be associated with the same word, as indicated by the problem description.

3. **Processing Logic**: The program processes each line of input, splitting it into a word and a page number, and appends the page number (converted to an integer) to the list associated with that word. This directly follows the requirement that each word can appear on multiple pages.

4. **Sorting and Output**: After processing the input, the program sorts the words alphabetically and then sorts the page numbers in ascending order for each word. It prints each word followed by its associated sorted list of page numbers, which matches the output format described in the problem.

5. **Constraints Handling**: The program adheres to the constraints mentioned in the problem description: it ensures that words consist of at most 30 characters and page numbers are less than or equal to 1000. Furthermore, it inherently respects the limit of 100 pairs due to the conditions set for the `defaultdict` and input reading.

6. **Output Format**: The output is formatted as specified, with each word on a new line followed by its corresponding page numbers in ascending order on the next line(s), separated by spaces.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to fulfill the problem requirements and properly handles the input and output as specified. Therefore, it is correct.
