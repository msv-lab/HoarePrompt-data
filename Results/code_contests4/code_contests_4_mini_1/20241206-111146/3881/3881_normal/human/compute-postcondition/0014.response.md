According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in the `index` defaultdict. The loop iterates over the sorted order of these keys. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the first word in the sorted order of the keys, and `index` contains at least one word as a key. Since the loop is iterating over the sorted keys, the next word to be processed will be the second word in the sorted order of the keys.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least two words in the `index`, so the next `word` will be the second word in the sorted order, and the corresponding `page` will be the page number for that second word. 

State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists containing at least two words as keys; `word` is the second word in the sorted order of the keys; `page` is the corresponding page number for `word`, and the value of `word` is printed as the sorted list of values from `index[word]`.**
