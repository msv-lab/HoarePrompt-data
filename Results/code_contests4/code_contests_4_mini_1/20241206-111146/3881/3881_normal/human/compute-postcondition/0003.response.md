The code appends the integer value of `page` to the list associated with the key `word` in the `index` defaultdict. The previous values of `index`, `word`, and `page` are not stated, but we know that `index` is a defaultdict of lists, and `word` and `page` are derived from splitting some input line.

Since `page` is converted to an integer and appended to the list for `word`, the state of `index` will now include `page` as part of the list for the corresponding `word`. The exact changes depend on the current contents of `index`, but the operation itself is clear.

Output State: **`index` is updated with `page` appended to the list for `word`, `word` and `page` are assigned values from splitting the first line of stdin.**
