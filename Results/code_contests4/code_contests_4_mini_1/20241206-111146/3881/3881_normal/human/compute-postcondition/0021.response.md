The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately. As a result, there are no changes or outputs generated by any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is a defaultdict of lists containing all words as keys in sorted order; `word` is the last word in the sorted order of the keys; `page` is the corresponding page number for `word`.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists containing all words as keys in sorted order; `word` is the last word in the sorted order of the keys; `page` is the corresponding page number for `word`.**
