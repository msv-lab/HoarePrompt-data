According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `stdin`. If there is at least one more line in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `index` has been updated with `page` appended to the list for `word`, and `word` and `page` have been assigned values from splitting the first line of `stdin`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `line` must contain the next line of input from `stdin`.

State: **`index` is updated with `page` appended to the list for `word`, `word` is the next word in the next line of stdin, `page` is the corresponding page from the next line of stdin.**
