Functionality: ** The function reads pairs of words and page numbers from standard input, where each word is associated with a list of page numbers. It stores these pairs in a dictionary with words as keys and lists of integers (page numbers) as values. After processing the input, it prints each word in alphabetical order followed by the sorted list of corresponding page numbers. The function does not take any parameters nor does it return any value; it directly prints the results to the standard output. **
