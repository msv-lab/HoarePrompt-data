According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as there are more lines in `stdin` to read. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the next word from `stdin`, `page` is the corresponding page from `stdin`, and `index[word]` has the integer value of `page` appended to its list. To execute the loop one more time, the next line must be read, which means there must be another word and page available in `stdin`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `word` will be updated to the next word from `stdin`, `page` will be updated to the corresponding next page from `stdin`, and `index[word]` will have the new `page` appended.

State: **`word` is the next word from stdin, `page` is the corresponding next page from stdin, `index[word]` will have the integer value of `page` appended to its list**
