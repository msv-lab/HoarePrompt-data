According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `index`. The loop will iterate over the sorted keys of the `index`, which are the words. For the loop to execute at least once, `index` must contain at least one word as a key. At the end of the last iteration, `word` will be the last word processed and `page` will be its corresponding page number. So for the loop to be executed, the `index` must contain at least one key, and `word` should correspond to the first word in the sorted order of the keys.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists containing at least one word as key, `word` is the first word in the sorted order of the keys, `page` is the corresponding page number for `word`**
