The code `print(*sorted(index[word]))` prints the sorted list of values from the list associated with the key `word` in the `index` defaultdict. The variable `word` is defined as the second word in the sorted order of the keys, and `page` is the corresponding page number for `word`.

Since `index` is a defaultdict of lists containing at least two words as keys, the values associated with `word` will be a list of words. The `sorted(index[word])` function sorts this list in ascending order, and the asterisk (`*`) operator unpacks this sorted list for printing.

The output of the code does not change the values of the variables, but it produces a printed output of the sorted words associated with the key `word`.

Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists containing at least two words as keys; `word` is the second word in the sorted order of the keys; `page` is the corresponding page number for `word`; `word` is printed as the sorted list of values from `index[word]`.**
