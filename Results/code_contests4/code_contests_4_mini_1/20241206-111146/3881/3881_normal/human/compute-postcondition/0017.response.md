According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in the `index` defaultdict. The loop will continue to execute for each key in the sorted order of the keys. At the end of the last iteration, the `word` is the second word in the sorted order of the keys, and `index` is a defaultdict of lists with at least two words as keys. 

To execute one more time, the loop needs to process the next word in the sorted order of keys. Since `word` is the second word, the next word will be the third word in the sorted order. For the loop to execute a third time, `index` must have at least three keys, and `word` should be updated to the third word in the sorted list.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict of lists containing at least three words as keys; `word` is the third word in the sorted order of the keys; `page` is the corresponding page number for `word`; `word` is printed as the sorted list of values from `index[word]`.**
