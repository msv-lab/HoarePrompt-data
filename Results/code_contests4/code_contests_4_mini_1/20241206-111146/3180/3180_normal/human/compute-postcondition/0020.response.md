Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 0 for the first execution, `j` is 1 for the second iteration. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `a` is calculated as `len(even) - evenc_most_common[0][1]`, `b` is calculated as `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[1][1]`, and `m` is updated to include `a + b`.***
