According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which is iterated over the range of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. This means that the loop has executed once for `j = 0` and once for `j = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must reach 2, but since the range is from 0 to 1, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute one more time cannot be satisfied as `j` has already reached its maximum value defined by the range, which is 2. 

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; the loop cannot execute again as `j` is at its maximum value defined by the range.**
