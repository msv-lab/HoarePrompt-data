According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which iterates over a range of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed its first execution. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

After the first execution, `j` will become 1. Since the range is defined as `range(2)`, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than 2.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. The loop will execute a second time.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0 for the first execution, `j` is 1 for the second iteration.**
