Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is 0 for the first iteration and 1 for the second iteration, `m` contains values based on the conditions evaluated during the iterations, and the first element of `evenc_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common` at index `j`.***
