To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the loop's structure and the provided output states after each iteration. 

The loop iterates twice (`for j in range(2)`). During each iteration, it checks if `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`. If this condition is true, it calculates the values `a` and `b` and appends their sum to the list `m`.

Based on the provided details:

1. **First Iteration (j=0)**:
   - If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[0][0]`, then `a` is computed as `len(even) - evenc_most_common[0][1]`, and `b` as `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[0][1]`. The value `a + b` is appended to `m`.

2. **Second Iteration (j=1)**:
   - If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[1][0]`, then `a` is calculated as `len(even) - evenc_most_common[0][1]`, and `b` is calculated as `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[1][1]`. The value `a + b` is appended to `m`.

After both iterations, regardless of whether the conditions hold true or not, the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `m` will be in the following state:

- `n` remains unchanged as an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000.
- `i` is still 0 since it does not change in the loop.
- `j` will have taken on the values 0 and then 1 during the iterations, but its final value after the loop will not be relevant because we only care about the state after all iterations.
- `m` will contain the sum of `a + b` for each iteration where the condition was met.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have been executed is:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `m` contains values based on the conditions evaluated during the iterations.**
