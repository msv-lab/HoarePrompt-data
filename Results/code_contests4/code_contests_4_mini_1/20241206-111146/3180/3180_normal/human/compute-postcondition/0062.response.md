Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `m` contains values based on the lengths of the even and odd lists from comparisons between `evenc_most_common[i][0]` and `oddc_most_common[j][0]`. If `evenc_most_common[i][0]` is not equal to `oddc_most_common[j][0]`, then `m` has been updated with the calculated values of `a + b` for each valid comparison, where `a` is the number of even elements minus the frequency of the most common even element, and `b` is the number of odd elements minus the frequency of the most common odd element.**
