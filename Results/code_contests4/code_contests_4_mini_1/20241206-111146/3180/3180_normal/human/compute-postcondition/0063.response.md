Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `m` contains the sums `a + b` for each valid comparison between the most common elements of `evenc` and `oddc`, where `a` is the number of even elements minus the frequency of the most common even element, and `b` is the number of odd elements minus the frequency of the most common odd element.**
