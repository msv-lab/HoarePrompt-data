According to the code, the loop will execute a fixed number of times determined by the range function, which is `2` in this case. Since `j` will take values `0` and `1` for the two iterations, the initial states of `n` and `i` do not directly influence the loop's ability to execute. 

However, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized properly. At the start of the loop, `j` should be `0` for the first execution. The state of `i` (whether it is `0` or `1`) does not affect the execution of this loop. 

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0 for the first execution, `j` is 0 for the first iteration**
