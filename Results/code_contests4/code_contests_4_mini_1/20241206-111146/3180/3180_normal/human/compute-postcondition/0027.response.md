According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 and is incremented by 1 with each iteration. The loop is set to execute a total of 2 times, as specified by `range(2)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 2. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.

Since `j` is currently 2, and `n` is an even integer within the specified range, there are no additional restrictions based on these variables for the next iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be updated to 1, while other states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` contains values based on the conditions evaluated during the iterations.**
