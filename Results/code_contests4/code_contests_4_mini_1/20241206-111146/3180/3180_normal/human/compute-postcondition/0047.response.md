Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is 0 for the first execution of the loop, `m` contains values based on the lengths of the even and odd lists, and the first element of `evenc_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common` at index `j`.***
