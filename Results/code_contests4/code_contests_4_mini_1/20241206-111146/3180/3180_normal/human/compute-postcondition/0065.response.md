The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the assumption that `n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 100000, and `v` is a list of integers where each integer in `v` is within the range of 1 to 100000. The function outputs specific results based on the values of `n` and the contents of the list `v`. 

Functionality: **The function operates on an even integer n (2 <= n <= 100000) and a list of integers v (1 <= v_i <= 100000), returning results based on the values of n and the elements of the list v.**
