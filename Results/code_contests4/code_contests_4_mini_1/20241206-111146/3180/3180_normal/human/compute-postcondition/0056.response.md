Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `m` contains values based on the lengths of the even and odd lists. If the most common element in the even list at index `i` is not equal to the most common element in the odd list at index `j`, then `a` is assigned the value of `len(even) - evenc_most_common[2][1]`, `b` is assigned the value of `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[j][1]`, and `m` is updated to include the value `a + b`. There is no else part for this condition.***
