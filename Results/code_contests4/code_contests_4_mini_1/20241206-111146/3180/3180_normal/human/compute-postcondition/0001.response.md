`v` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes an input line, splits it into separate values, converts each to an integer, and creates an iterable. The variable `n` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `v` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `v` is a list of integers from the input.**
