According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which iterates through the range of 2 (0 and 1). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, indicating that the loop has executed for both values of `j` (0 and 1). Since the loop has completed all its iterations (as `j` reaches the upper limit of the range), it cannot execute again unless the loop is re-entered with a fresh state.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` would need to be reset to 0. However, since this is the end of the second iteration, the loop will not run again unless the entire structure is repeated.

State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute again.**
