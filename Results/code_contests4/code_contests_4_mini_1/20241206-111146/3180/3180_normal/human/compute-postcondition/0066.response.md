Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a list of integers `v` (where each element satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 100000). It calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `v` to ensure that the most common even and odd integers in the list are different. The function returns this minimum number. **
