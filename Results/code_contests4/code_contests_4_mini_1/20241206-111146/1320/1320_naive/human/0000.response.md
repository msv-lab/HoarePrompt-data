To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Description Summary
The task is to count how many "beautiful" numbers exist between 1 and a given integer `n`, inclusive. A "beautiful" number is defined as a number that consists of the same digit repeated, such as 1, 22, 333, etc. 

### Expected Output
For each test case, the output should be the count of beautiful numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Analyzing the Program
The program seems to define several functions that appear unrelated to the problem statement. Specifically, the key function `func_8(X)` is designed to compute something based on the input list `X`, using the formula `(maxX - minX - 2) * 2`, which is unclear in relation to counting beautiful numbers. 

### Potential Issues
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for counting beautiful numbers is missing entirely. The program does not check for beautiful numbers at all, and instead computes a value based on the minimum and maximum of the input list, which does not align with the problem description.
   
2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_4()` is used to read input, but it is unclear how it connects to counting beautiful numbers. The expected output format does not match with the operations in `func_8()`.

### Example Case
To illustrate the issue:
- If `n = 18`, we expect the output to be `10` because the beautiful numbers up to 18 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11.
- However, the program will not produce this correct output because it does not implement any logic to count beautiful numbers.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails to implement the required logic to count beautiful numbers accurately for any input, we conclude that it does not fulfill the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
