Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description. The problem requires counting "beautiful" numbers (which are numbers consisting of only one digit repeated) from 1 to n for multiple test cases, but the code does not implement this functionality.

1. The function `func_8(X)` is supposed to compute something based on the input list `X`, but it does not relate to counting beautiful numbers. Instead, it calculates a value based on the minimum and maximum of the list, which is irrelevant to the task.

2. The logic to identify beautiful numbers is absent. Beautiful numbers, as defined, include 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 11, 22, 33, ..., 99, 111, 222, ..., up to the maximum beautiful number within the range of `n`. The program should specifically count these numbers, but it does not.

3. For example, when n = 18, the expected output is 10 (beautiful numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11). The program will not produce this output because it does not check for beautiful numbers at all.

Therefore, as the program fails to handle the core requirement of counting beautiful numbers for given values of `n`, I conclude that the program is incorrect.
