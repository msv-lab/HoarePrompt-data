The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `X`. `X` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9, representing the number of years Polycarp has turned. After executing the function body, the expression evaluates to -2 because maxX and minX are both equal to X, which leads to the calculation (maxX - minX - 2) resulting in (X - X - 2). The function then returns the maximum value between 0 and -2, which is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a positive integer `X` and return 0 based on the evaluation of the expression involving maxX and minX. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer X and returns 0.**
