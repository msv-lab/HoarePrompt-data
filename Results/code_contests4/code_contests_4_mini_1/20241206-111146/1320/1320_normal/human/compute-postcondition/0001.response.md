The variable `maxX` is assigned the value of `max(X)`. Since `X` is a positive integer and falls within the range of 1 to \(10^9\), the value of `max(X)` will be equal to `X`. Therefore, `maxX` will take on the value of `X`. The state of `minX` remains unchanged as it is still equal to `X`. 

Output State: **`X` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 10^9; `minX` is `X`; `maxX` is `X`**
