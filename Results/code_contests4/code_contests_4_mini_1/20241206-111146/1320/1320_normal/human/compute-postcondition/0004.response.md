Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of positive integers `X` (representing the number of years Polycarp has turned) and returns the maximum value between 0 and the calculated expression `(max(X) - min(X) - 2) * 2`. This means if all elements in `X` are equal or if there are fewer than three distinct years, the function will return 0; otherwise, it will return a positive integer based on the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `X`. **
