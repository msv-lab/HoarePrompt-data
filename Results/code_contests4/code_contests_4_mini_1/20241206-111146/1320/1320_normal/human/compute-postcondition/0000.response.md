The code `minX = min(X)` assigns the minimum value of `X` to the variable `minX`. Since `X` is a positive integer and can be between 1 and 10^9, and there are multiple test cases, `minX` will take the value of `X` itself, as `min` is applied to a single integer value in this context. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `X` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 10^9; `minX` is `X`.

Output State: **`X` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 10^9; `minX` is `X`**
