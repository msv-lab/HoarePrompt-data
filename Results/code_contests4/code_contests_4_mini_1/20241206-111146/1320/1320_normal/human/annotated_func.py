#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers, where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) represents the age Polycarp has turned for multiple test cases, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicates the number of integers in the list.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `s`, each representing an age where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the length of the list is at most 10^4. It outputs the string representation of the list to the standard output, but does not return any value or process the ages in any meaningful way.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the length of s is an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `s`, where each integer is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and the length of the list is between 1 and 10^4. It writes the string representation of the list `s` to the standard output followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer read from input, which is a positive integer n with the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a positive integer n read from input, where n is guaranteed to satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000.
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from reading a line of input and splitting it into separate values
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an iterator of integers obtained from reading a single line of input, splitting that input string by whitespace, and converting each split value to an integer. This function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input, such as non-integer values or empty input lines.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) indicating how many years Polycarp has turned.
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the input value for n, which represents how many years Polycarp has turned, as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the input value for `n`, which represents how many years Polycarp has turned, as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). There are no checks or validations for the input value, so it is expected that the caller ensures that `n` falls within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained from splitting the input read from the standard input, which corresponds to the values for each test case n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the standard input, reads a line, splits it into components by whitespace, and returns a list of strings. Each string corresponds to a positive integer value for test cases, where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function does not handle any errors related to input format or constraints, so it assumes valid input is provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length tuple of positive integers, where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a variable-length tuple of positive integers, where each integer `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `debug` is true, the output is a space-separated string of the integers within `args`. If `debug` is false, there is no output generated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length tuple of positive integers, where each integer satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If the `debug` flag is true, it outputs a space-separated string of the integers in the tuple; otherwise, it performs no output. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: X is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9, representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, and there may be multiple test cases with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns 0 because maxX and minX are equal to X, making the expression (maxX - minX - 2) evaluate to (X - X - 2) = -2, and max(0, -2) is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `X` (representing the number of years Polycarp has turned) and returns the maximum value between 0 and the calculated expression `(max(X) - min(X) - 2) * 2`. This means if all elements in `X` are equal or if there are fewer than three distinct years, the function will return 0; otherwise, it will return a positive integer based on the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `X`.
