Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem requires counting the number of "beautiful" years from 1 to n for multiple test cases, where a beautiful year is defined as a number that consists of only one digit repeated one or more times (like 1, 22, 333, etc.).

Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Functions Lack Logic for Counting Beautiful Years**: None of the functions in the program contain logic to determine or count the beautiful years. They either read input, write output, or perform basic operations, but they do not implement the necessary algorithm to count the beautiful numbers between 1 and n.

2. **Function Purpose Misalignment**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, and `func_8` do not address the core requirement of the task. Specifically, there is no function that processes the input values of n to compute the count of beautiful numbers based on the definition provided.

3. **Output Format**: The problem description specifies that the output should be a list of integers representing the count of beautiful years for each test case, but the program does not include any mechanism to produce this output correctly based on the input.

Since the program fails to implement the required functionality to count beautiful numbers and does not return appropriate results for test cases, it does not fulfill the problem description's requirements.
