You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers, where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) represents the age Polycarp has turned for multiple test cases, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicates the number of integers in the list.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `s`, each representing an age where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the length of the list is at most 10^4. It outputs the string representation of the list to the standard output, but does not return any value or process the ages in any meaningful way.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the length of s is an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `s`, where each integer is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and the length of the list is between 1 and 10^4. It writes the string representation of the list `s` to the standard output followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer read from input, which is a positive integer n with the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a positive integer n read from input, where n is guaranteed to satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000.
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from reading a line of input and splitting it into separate values
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an iterator of integers obtained from reading a single line of input, splitting that input string by whitespace, and converting each split value to an integer. This function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input, such as non-integer values or empty input lines.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) indicating how many years Polycarp has turned.
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the input value for n, which represents how many years Polycarp has turned, as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the input value for `n`, which represents how many years Polycarp has turned, as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). There are no checks or validations for the input value, so it is expected that the caller ensures that `n` falls within the specified range.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained from splitting the input read from the standard input, which corresponds to the values for each test case n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the standard input, reads a line, splits it into components by whitespace, and returns a list of strings. Each string corresponds to a positive integer value for test cases, where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function does not handle any errors related to input format or constraints, so it assumes valid input is provided.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length tuple of positive integers, where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a variable-length tuple of positive integers, where each integer `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `debug` is true, the output is a space-separated string of the integers within `args`. If `debug` is false, there is no output generated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable-length tuple of positive integers, where each integer satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If the `debug` flag is true, it outputs a space-separated string of the integers in the tuple; otherwise, it performs no output. The function does not return any value.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: X is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9, representing the number of years Polycarp has turned, and there may be multiple test cases with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns 0 because maxX and minX are equal to X, making the expression (maxX - minX - 2) evaluate to (X - X - 2) = -2, and max(0, -2) is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `X` (representing the number of years Polycarp has turned) and returns the maximum value between 0 and the calculated expression `(max(X) - min(X) - 2) * 2`. This means if all elements in `X` are equal or if there are fewer than three distinct years, the function will return 0; otherwise, it will return a positive integer based on the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `X`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
