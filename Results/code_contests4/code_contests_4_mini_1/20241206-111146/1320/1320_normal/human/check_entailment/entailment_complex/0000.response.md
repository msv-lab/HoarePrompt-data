Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the logic required to determine the number of beautiful years Polycarp has celebrated, as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires counting numbers that consist of a single digit repeated one or more times (like 1, 2, 11, 22, etc.) within the range from 1 to n for each test case. 

However, the functions primarily serve to read and output the input values without any processing to count beautiful numbers. For instance:

- `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` simply read input or print values without performing any calculations related to beautiful numbers.
- `func_8`, despite calculating a value based on max and min, does not address the counting of beautiful numbers as required by the problem statement.

The annotations suggest that the functions are not designed to compute the correct results for the requirements given in the problem description, and there is no logical flow to count beautiful numbers for the input values.

For example, if n = 18, the correct beautiful numbers would be 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 11, 22, which should return 10. However, the provided functions do not generate this output, indicating that the program is fundamentally incorrect in its current state without any processing logic to fulfill the problem requirements.
