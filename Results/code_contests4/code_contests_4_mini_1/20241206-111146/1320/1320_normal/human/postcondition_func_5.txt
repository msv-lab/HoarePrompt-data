The function accepts input from the standard input, reads a line, splits it into components by whitespace, and returns a list of strings. Each string corresponds to a positive integer value for test cases, where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function does not handle any errors related to input format or constraints, so it assumes valid input is provided.
