The function accepts a list of strings `c`, which includes a count of `#define` constructions followed by the respective `#define` statements and a valid arithmetic expression. It returns a formatted string that simply wraps the entire list `c` in a `macro()` function call, but it does not validate the contents of `c` or check for proper formatting beyond what is given.
