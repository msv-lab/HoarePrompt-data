n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 100, and each #define construction has a valid syntax with a name and an expression consisting of digits, variable names, previously defined macro names, round brackets, and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The final expression is a non-empty string that also satisfies these conditions.
