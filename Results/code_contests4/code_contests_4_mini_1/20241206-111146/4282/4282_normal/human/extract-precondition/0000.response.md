Precondition: **s is a string containing multiple lines where the first line is a non-negative integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of #define constructions, followed by n lines each containing a #define construction in the format "#define name expression", and ending with a non-empty expression that may include variables, previously defined macros, and arithmetic operations. The expression and macros are guaranteed to be valid arithmetic expressions with no unary operations.**
