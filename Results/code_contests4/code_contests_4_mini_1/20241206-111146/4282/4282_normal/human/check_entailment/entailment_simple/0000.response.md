Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails to do so:

1. **Macro Definition and Substitution**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not effectively manage the macro definitions and their substitutions as described. Specifically, `func_1` simply formats the input into a string rather than performing any logical operation related to macros. The actual replacement of macro names with their values is not performed in a meaningful way.

2. **Evaluation and Parentheses Management**: The program lacks a proper mechanism to ensure that the order of operations (and thus the presence of parentheses) is preserved according to the rules established in the problem description. The handling of parentheses inside `func_2` does not follow the required logic for safe substitution, and the use of `eval` is risky and does not align with the problem's need for controlled expression evaluation.

3. **Output Check**: The goal is to determine if the resulting expression is "suspicious" or "OK" based on the defined rules. However, the return statement `return eval(f[0]).level` is not checking the conditions necessary to make that determination. Instead, it attempts to access an attribute `level`, which is not defined in the context presented.

4. **Handling Whitespace**: While the problem specifies that the input can contain arbitrary whitespace, the program does not seem to robustly handle this aspect in parsing the input or constructing the resulting expressions.

5. **Edge Cases and Validity**: The program does not account for edge cases that may arise from invalid substitutions or nested macros, which could lead to incorrect evaluations or outputs.

Due to these issues, the program does not adhere to the specifications laid out in the problem description and therefore is deemed incorrect.
