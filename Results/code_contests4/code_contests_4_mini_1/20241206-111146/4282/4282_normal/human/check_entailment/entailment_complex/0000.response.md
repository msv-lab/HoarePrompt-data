Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the implementation does not appear to correctly handle the situation where the order of operations changes due to macro substitution, particularly when macros are substituted in a way that is not wrapped in brackets. 

For example, consider the following definitions:

```
#define sum x + y
```

If we have an expression `2 * sum`, the expected "safe" substitution (with brackets) would yield `2 * (x + y)`, which should be considered non-suspicious. However, the ordinary substitution yields `2 * x + y`, which is suspicious because the order of operations changes.

The function `func_2` processes the expression and uses `eval`, but it does not properly account for the precedence of operations after substitution. The annotations indicate that the function returns a 'level' attribute of the evaluated expression, but this does not ensure that it recognizes when the expression becomes suspicious as described in the problem statement.

Furthermore, the annotations mention that if there are any undefined macros, they default to '1', which could lead to situations where the replacement could be misleading or incorrect without raising a flag for potential suspicious expressions. 

Overall, the program fails to identify such edge cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it does not fully adhere to the specifications outlined in the problem description.
