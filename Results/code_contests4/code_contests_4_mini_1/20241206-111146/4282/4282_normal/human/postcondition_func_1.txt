The function accepts a string `s` that contains a number of macro definitions and an arithmetic expression. It processes the string to evaluate the expression, incorporating the macro definitions as needed. Finally, it returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated result. If there are any undefined macros, they default to '1', and the function will handle arithmetic operations accordingly. The function does not handle cases where the arithmetic expression may lead to errors such as division by zero or invalid operations, which should be considered edge cases.
