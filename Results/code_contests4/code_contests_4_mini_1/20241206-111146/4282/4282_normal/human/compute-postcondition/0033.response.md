To evaluate the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state, we analyze it step-by-step.

1. `f` is a list containing empty strings.
2. `s` has at least 2 characters, so `c`, which is defined as the third character of the joined string from `s`, is valid and can be accessed.
3. `n` is increased by `c`, which implies `n` should be an integer or a value that can be manipulated with `c`. Since `c` is derived from `s`, its value is relevant for the calculation.
4. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `v.get(n, '1')`. This means that if `n` is a key in the dictionary `v`, `func_1` will receive the corresponding value; if not, it will receive the default value `'1'`.
5. The result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` is added to the last element (`f[-1]`) of the list `f`. 

Since the value of `v`, `func_1`, and the specifics of what is returned by `func_1` are not provided, and the only concrete updates are to `f`, we can't determine exact values. However, we can conclude that `f[-1]` will be modified based on the output of `func_1`.

Considering the lack of specific values but knowing that `f[-1]` is being updated, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`f` is a list containing empty strings, `s` has at least 2 characters, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `f[-1]` is updated by the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.**
