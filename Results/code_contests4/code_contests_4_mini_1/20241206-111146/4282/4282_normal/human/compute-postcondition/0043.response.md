Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing empty strings. If `c` is either '(' or ')', then if `c` is '(', an additional empty string is appended to `f`, and if `c` is ')', `m` is appended to the last element of `f`. If `c` is neither '(' nor ')', the last element of `f` is updated to include `c`. In all cases, `n` remains unchanged. If `c` is not one of these symbols, then `n` is increased by the ASCII value of `c`. Regardless of the case, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `c` is the third character of the joined string from `s`.***
