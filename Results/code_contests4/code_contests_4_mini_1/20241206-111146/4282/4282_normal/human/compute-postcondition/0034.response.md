The value of `n` is assigned an empty string. Since `n` is used as a key in the expression `v.get(n, '1')`, it will return the value associated with the empty string key in the dictionary `v`, or '1' if that key does not exist. The previous values of `f` remain unchanged except for the last element, which is updated by the result of the function call `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing empty strings with the last element updated by the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`, `s` has at least 2 characters, `c` is the third character of `s`.**
