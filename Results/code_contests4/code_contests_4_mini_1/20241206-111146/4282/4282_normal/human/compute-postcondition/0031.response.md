Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing empty strings. If `c` is '(', then `f` becomes a list containing two empty strings. If `c` is ')' and there is an attempt to concatenate to a non-existent element in `f`, it results in an error. For any other operator or character in `c`, `c` is appended to the last element of `f`, while `n` remains an empty string. In the else case, `f` still contains an empty string, `s` has at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of the joined string from `s`, and `n` is increased by `c`.***
