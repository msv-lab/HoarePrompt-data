Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing empty strings. If `c` is equal to `')'`, `m` is appended to the last element of `f`. If `c` is not equal to `')'`, the last element of `f` is updated to include `c`. In both cases, `n` is not an empty string, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `c` is the third character of `s`.***
