Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing an empty string. If `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', or ')', the last element of `f` is updated based on the value of `c`. Specifically, if `c` is '(', no changes are made to `f`; if `c` is ')', the last element of `f` is updated to include the result of `func_1('10')`, and `n` remains an empty string; otherwise, the last element of `f` is updated to be the previous last element concatenated with `c`, with `n` remaining an empty string. If `c` is not one of these characters, `n` is updated to the character `c`, while `f` remains a list containing an empty string and `s` contains at least one character with `c` being the first character of the joined string from `s`.***
