Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing an empty string, `n` is an empty string, `s` contains at least one character, and `c` is one of the characters '+', '-', '*', '/', or '('. If `n` is not empty, the last element of `f` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` to it. If `n` is empty, no changes are made to `f`.***
