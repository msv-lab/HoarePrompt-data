The code appends an empty string to the list `f`. The previous state of `f` is that it contains empty strings, but no specific values are provided. Thus, after executing `f.append('')`, `f` will have one additional empty string appended to it. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `c`) remain unaffected as the code only modifies the list `f`.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing empty strings, with one additional empty string appended.**
