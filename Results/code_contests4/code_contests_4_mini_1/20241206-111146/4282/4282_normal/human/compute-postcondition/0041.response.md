Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing empty strings. If `c` is equal to '(', an additional empty string is appended to `f`. If `c` is equal to ')', `m` is appended to the last element of `f`. If `c` is neither '(' nor ')', the last element of `f` is updated to include `c`. In all cases, `n` is not an empty string, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `c` is the third character of `s`.***
