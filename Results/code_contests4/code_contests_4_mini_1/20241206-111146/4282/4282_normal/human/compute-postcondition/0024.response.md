The value of `f` initially contains one element, which is an empty string. The code `f.append('')` adds another empty string to the list `f`. Therefore, after execution, `f` now contains two elements, both of which are empty strings. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`f` is a list containing two empty strings**
