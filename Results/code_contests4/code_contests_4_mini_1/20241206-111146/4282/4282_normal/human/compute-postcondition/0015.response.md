Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing an empty string. If `c` is equal to ')', the last element of `f` is updated to include the result of `func_1('10')`, and `n` remains an empty string. Otherwise, the last element of `f` is updated to be the previous last element concatenated with `c`, while `n` remains an empty string.***
