Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing the processed strings based on characters from `s`, and `n` is a string containing any characters from `s` that are not operators or parentheses. If `n` is not an empty string, `f[0]` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`. If `n` is an empty string, there is no change to `f`.***
