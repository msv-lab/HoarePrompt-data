The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string containing multiple lines, where the first line is a non-negative integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) that indicates the number of `#define` constructions, followed by `n` lines each containing a `#define` construction in the format `#define name expression`. The input ends with a non-empty expression that may include variables, previously defined macros, and arithmetic operations. After executing the function body, the program returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated expression from `f[0]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `s` that includes macro definitions and an expression, and return the 'level' attribute of the evaluated expression. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string s containing macro definitions and an expression, and returns the 'level' attribute of the evaluated expression from f[0].**
