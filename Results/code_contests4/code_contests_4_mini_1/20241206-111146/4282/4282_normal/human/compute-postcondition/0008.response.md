The code `f.append('')` adds an empty string to the list `f`. The previous state of `f` was a list containing an empty string, so after executing the code, `f` will now contain two empty strings. The values of `n`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list containing two empty strings, `n` is an empty string, `s` contains at least one character, and `c` is equal to '('.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing two empty strings, `n` is an empty string, `s` contains at least one character, `c` is equal to '('**.
