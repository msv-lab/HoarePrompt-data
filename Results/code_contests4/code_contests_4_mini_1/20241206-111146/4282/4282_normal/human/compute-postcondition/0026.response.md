To analyze the provided code, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `f` is a list containing an empty string: `f = ['']`
   - `n` is an empty string: `n = ''`
   - `m` is assigned the result of `func_1('10')[eval(f.pop()).level == '0']`. Since `f` contains an empty string, `f.pop()` will return `''` and remove it from the list, making `f` an empty list now. The expression inside `eval()` is `''`, which is likely not valid unless `func_1` returns something that can be evaluated as a valid expression.

2. Assuming `func_1('10')` returns a list or similar structure where the condition `eval(f.pop()).level == '0'` can be evaluated, and considering that `level` is a property that needs to be checked against the string `'0'`.

3. The next statement `f[-1] += m` is attempting to concatenate `m` to the last element of `f`. Since `f` is now empty after the pop operation, this will raise an IndexError if executed.

Based on these observations, we can summarize the output state considering that `f` is now empty and `m`'s value is uncertain due to the context of `func_1` and `eval`.

Output State: **`f` is an empty list, `n` is an empty string, and there is an attempt to concatenate to a non-existent element in `f`.**
