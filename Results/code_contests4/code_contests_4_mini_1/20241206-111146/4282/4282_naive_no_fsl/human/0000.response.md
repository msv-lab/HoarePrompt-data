Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the replacement of macros, particularly when it comes to managing the precedence of operations and ensuring that the expression remains valid after substitution. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:

```
2
#define sum (x + y)
#define mul (a * b)
sum + mul
```

Here, after the macro substitution, we would expect the expression to be `((x + y) + (a * b))`, which is correct and maintains the proper order of operations. However, if we change the expression to `x + sum + mul`, the expected result after substitution should be `x + (x + y) + (a * b)`, but the program may produce an incorrect output due to not properly handling nested macro evaluations and the addition of parentheses.

Thus, there exists a case where the program does not function as required, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed incorrect.
