The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it expects input from the user, which it reads as a space-separated string of numbers. The first element of this input, `testSNs[0]`, indicates how many subsequent numbers there are to process. The function then calculates the sum of these numbers, ignoring any that are multiples of 10. 

However, the annotations inaccurately suggest that the function accepts parameters A and B, while in reality, it takes input dynamically from user input. Furthermore, the loop iterates based on the value at `testSNs[0]`, which is misleadingly described in the annotations as if it were directly related to A and B's constraints. 

The actual functionality does not guarantee that A and B are handled or that the input strictly adheres to the annotations regarding their constraints. The function also does not perform error handling for non-integer inputs or invalid cases where the number of inputs might be less than expected.

Functionality: ** The function reads a space-separated list of integers from user input, sums all integers except those that are multiples of 10, and prints the total score. It does not accept parameters directly and lacks input validation. **
