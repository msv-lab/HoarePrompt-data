The function `func` accepts two parameters, `A` and `B`. Both `A` and `B` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ B ≤ 9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integer parameters, `A` and `B`, both within the range of 1 to 9.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters A and B, both integers constrained between 1 and 9.**
