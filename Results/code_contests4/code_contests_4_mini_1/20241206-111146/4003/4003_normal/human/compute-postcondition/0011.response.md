Postcondition: ***`A` and `B` are integers such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ `B` ≤ 9. If the last digit of `testSNs[1]` is not 0, `SCORE` is updated to `SCORE + testSNs[1]` while `x` remains 1. Otherwise, `SCORE` retains its value as the integer of `testSNs[0]`, and `x` remains 1, skipping the rest of the current iteration of the loop.***
