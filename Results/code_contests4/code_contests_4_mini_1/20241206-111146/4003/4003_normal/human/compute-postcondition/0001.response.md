The variable `SCORE` is assigned the value of `int(0)`, which means it is set to 0. The previous values of `A`, `B`, and `testSNs` are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `SCORE` while maintaining the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 9, `B` is an integer such that 1 ≤ B ≤ 9, `testSNs` is a list of strings from input, `SCORE` is 0**.
