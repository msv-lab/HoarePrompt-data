The variable `testSNs` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will take input from the user, split that input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and store it in `testSNs`. The values of `A` and `B` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is that `A` and `B` remain as integers within their specified range, while `testSNs` contains the input split into a list of strings.

Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 9, `B` is an integer such that 1 ≤ B ≤ 9, `testSNs` is a list of strings from input**.
