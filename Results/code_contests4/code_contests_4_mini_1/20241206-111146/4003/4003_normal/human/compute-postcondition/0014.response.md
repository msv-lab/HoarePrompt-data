The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ `B` ≤ 9; `x` is 2; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
