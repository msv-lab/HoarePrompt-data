The values of the variables do not change, but we encounter a `continue` statement which would skip the current iteration of a loop (if present) and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no information about the loop structure, we can only note that we are skipping to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 9, `B` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `B` ≤ 9, `testSNs` is a list containing at least one string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0, `SCORE` is 0, `x` is 0, and the last digit of the integer value of `testSNs[x]` is 0; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
