Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 9, `B` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `B` ≤ 9, `testSNs` is a list containing at least one string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0, if the last digit of the integer value of `testSNs[0]` is not 0, then `SCORE` is the integer value of `testSNs[0]` and `x` is 0. Otherwise, if the last digit of the integer value of `testSNs[0]` is 0, then `SCORE` remains 0, `x` is still 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
