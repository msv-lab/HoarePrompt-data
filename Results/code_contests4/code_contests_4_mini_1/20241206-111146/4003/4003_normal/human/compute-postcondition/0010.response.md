The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 9, `B` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `B` ≤ 9, `testSNs` is a list containing at least one string that can be converted to an integer greater than 1, SCORE is the integer value of `testSNs[0]`, and `x` is 1 while we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
