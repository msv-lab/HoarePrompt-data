The function accepts a positive integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes a string `s` consisting of characters 'R', 'P', and 'S'. It counts the occurrences of each character and identifies which character has the maximum frequency. The function then prints a string composed of the character that would beat the most frequent character in the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, repeated for the length of the input string. The function does not return any values; it directly prints the results for each test case.
