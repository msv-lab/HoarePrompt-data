The code creates a dictionary called `mapper` where the keys are the characters 'R', 'P', and 'S', and they are mapped to the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively. This code does not affect the previous values of `t` or `s`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `t` and `s`, while `mapper` is now defined with the specified key-value pairs.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), `mapper` is {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}**
