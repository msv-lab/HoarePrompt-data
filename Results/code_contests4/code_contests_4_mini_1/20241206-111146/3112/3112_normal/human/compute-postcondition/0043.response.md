Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); `S` is a list populated with values based on the input for each iteration; `count` contains the frequency of 'R', 'P', and 'S' for each input string; `maxi` is either -2, -1, or 0 at the end of each iteration; the output is a string consisting of the character from 'RPS' at the index of `maxi` repeated `len(S)` times for each input string.**
