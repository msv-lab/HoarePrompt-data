The variable `input` is assigned the function `raw_input`, which alters the way input is taken in the program. However, the values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged as this line only redefines the `input` function without affecting the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), and `input` is now referencing `raw_input`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), and `input` is now referencing `raw_input`.**
