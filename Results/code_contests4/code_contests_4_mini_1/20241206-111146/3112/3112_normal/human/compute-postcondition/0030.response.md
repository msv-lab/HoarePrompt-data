According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than the number of iterations that have already been executed, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxi` has been decreased by 2, and since the loop variable is not explicitly defined in the iteration, we can denote it as `_`, which means it does not affect other states. The loop has executed once, so to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`maxi` results in either 'R', 'P', or 'S' multiplied by `len(S)`; `count` is updated based on all values in `S`; `maxi` has been decreased by 2; for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1.**
