According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. Since `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), the loop will execute while the current iteration index (denoted by `_`) is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` remains unchanged, but `maxi` has been decreased by 2. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to identify that the loop has executed `t` times, and to execute one more time, `t` should still be greater than the current iteration count. Therefore, the next index for the loop will be equal to the current iteration count, which is equal to `t` in this case.

Thus, the states should be adjusted as follows: `maxi` will be decreased by 2 again, and the loop iteration should be one more than it has previously executed.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `S` is a list populated with values based on `t`, `count` contains the frequency of each index value from `S` in the range of 0 to 2, `maxi` is decreased by 2 again, for the loop to execute one more time the iteration count must be equal to `t`**
