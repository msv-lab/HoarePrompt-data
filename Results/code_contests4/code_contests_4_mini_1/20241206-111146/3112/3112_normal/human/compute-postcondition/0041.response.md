The value of `maxi` is decremented by 2, but since `maxi` can be either 'R', 'P', or 'S', which are strings, the operation `maxi -= 2` is invalid for string types and will not produce a valid state. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`maxi` is either 'R', 'P', or 'S'; `count` remains unchanged, and the operation is invalid.**
