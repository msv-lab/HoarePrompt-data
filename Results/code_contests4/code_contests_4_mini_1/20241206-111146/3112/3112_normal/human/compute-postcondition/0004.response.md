According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, its value must be set before the loop executes. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted for the loop execution as it is not used within the loop body. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), for the loop to execute the first time `t` is at least 1**
