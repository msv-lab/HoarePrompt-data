According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ban` list. The loop will only execute if `ban` contains at least one element, as it is iterating over the pairs of `(x, y)` in `ban`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `ban` list must have a length greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `x` and `y` will take on the values of the first pair in the `ban` list.

State: **`ban` is a list of length `m` with at least 1 element, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `x` and `y` are the first elements of the first pair in `ban`**
