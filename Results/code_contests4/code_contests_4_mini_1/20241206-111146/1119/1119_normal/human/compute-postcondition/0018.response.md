The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown. Other variables (`ban`, `r`, `c`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ban` is a list of length `m`, `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, and `i` is equal to \(2 + \frac{n - 2}{2}\) if \(n \geq 4\) or does not exist if \(n < 4\).

Output State: **`ban` is a list of length `m`, `ans` is increased by 1, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, and `i` is equal to \(2 + \frac{n - 2}{2}\) if \(n \geq 4\) or does not exist if \(n < 4\)**.
