The code adds the sum of specific values from the lists `r` and `c` to `ans`. The values being summed are `r[4]`, `r[n - 4 + 1]`, `c[4]`, and `c[n - 4 + 1]`. Since `r` and `c` are initialized as lists of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, all the values being accessed are 0. Therefore, the sum is:

```
sum([r[4], r[n - 4 + 1], c[4], c[n - 4 + 1]]) = sum([0, 0, 0, 0]) = 0
```

As a result, `ans` remains unchanged because we are adding 0 to it. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`ban` is a list of length `m`, `ans` is unchanged, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 4.**
