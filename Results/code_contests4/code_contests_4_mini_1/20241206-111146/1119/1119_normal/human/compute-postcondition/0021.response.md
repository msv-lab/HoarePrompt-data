The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\), and `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\). It also processes `m` pairs of integers \((x_i, y_i)\) representing the coordinates of banned cells, where \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n\) and all pairs are distinct.

The function's output is based on the provided constraints and relationships. It likely returns a value that pertains to the layout or status of a grid of size \(n \times n\) while considering the banned cells defined by the pairs of integers. However, the specific output is not given. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a grid defined by the integer `n` and a list of banned cell coordinates defined by `m` pairs of integers while adhering to the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a grid of size n x n with banned cells defined by m pairs of coordinates, where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and m is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), returning information based on the grid and banned cells.**
