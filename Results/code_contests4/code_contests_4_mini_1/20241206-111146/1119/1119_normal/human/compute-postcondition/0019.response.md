Postcondition: ***`ban` is a list of length `m`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `n` is odd and either `r[(n + 1) // 2]` or `c[(n + 1) // 2]` is non-zero, while `r` and `c` remain lists of length `n + 1` filled with 0s. The variable `i` is equal to \(2 + \frac{n - 2}{2}\) if \(n \geq 4\) or does not exist if \(n < 4\).***
