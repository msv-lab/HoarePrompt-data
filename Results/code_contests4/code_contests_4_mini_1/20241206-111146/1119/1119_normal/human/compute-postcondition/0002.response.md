The code assigns the result of the list comprehension to four variables: `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans`. The list comprehension runs `m` times and calls `rints()` for each iteration, filling `ban` with the values returned by `rints()`. Meanwhile, `r` and `c` are initialized to lists of length `n + 1`, each filled with the value `1`. The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`.

Given the initial state constraints for `n` and `m`, we can summarize:

- `ban` will contain `m` items, where each item is the result of `rints()`.
- `r` is a list of size `n + 1`, all initialized to `1`.
- `c` is a list of size `n + 1`, also all initialized to `1`.
- `ans` is simply initialized to `0`.

Since `rints()` is expected to return two integers from input, but we do not have their specific values, we can only state that `ban` will have `m` values based on input.

Output State: **`ban` is a list of length `m` containing values from `rints()`, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 1s, `ans` is 0.**
