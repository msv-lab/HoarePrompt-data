The code snippet provided defines a lambda function `rints` that reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and returns a list of those integers. The existing variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n` and `m` and the new lambda function definition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from input.**
