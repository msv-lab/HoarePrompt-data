According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `2 + (n - 2) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3. For the loop to execute again, the condition must be satisfied: `2 + (n - 2) // 2` must be greater than 3.

State: **`ban` is a list of length `m`, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the values of `r[2]`, `r[n - 2 + 1]`, `c[2]`, `c[n - 2 + 1]`, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s at the indices corresponding to the first element of each pair in `ban`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s at the indices corresponding to the second element of each pair in `ban`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 4.**
