Postcondition: ***`ban` is a list of length `m`, `ans` is the cumulative sum from the iterations, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with 0s, and `i` is equal to \(2 + \frac{n - 2}{2}\) if \(n \geq 4\) or does not exist if \(n < 4\). The value of `n` is odd, and either `r[(n + 1) // 2]` or `c[(n + 1) // 2]` is non-zero.***
