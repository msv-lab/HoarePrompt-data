The values of `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both assigned the value 0. Since `r[x]` was already 0 and `c[y]` was also already 0, their values remain unchanged. The state of `ans` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0; the values have been reassigned but remain the same.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0; the values have been reassigned but remain the same.**
