The function accepts two integers, `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and `m` (where 0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000), representing the size of a grid and the number of banned cells, respectively. It takes `m` pairs of coordinates that denote the banned cells within an `n x n` grid. The function calculates the total count of valid positions based on the rows and columns that are not banned, and it accounts for a specific condition when `n` is odd. The result is printed as an integer. If there are no banned cells, the function still returns a meaningful result based on the grid configuration.
