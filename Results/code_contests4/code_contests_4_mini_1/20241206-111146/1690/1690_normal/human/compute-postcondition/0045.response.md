The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 3`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `en` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
