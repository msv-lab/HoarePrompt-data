The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after the execution, `cur` becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 3`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 2, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
