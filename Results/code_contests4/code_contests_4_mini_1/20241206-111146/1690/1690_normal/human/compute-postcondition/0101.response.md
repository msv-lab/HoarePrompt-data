Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 2, `be` is the number of iterations executed, and `en` is decreased by 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the condition is satisfied and the execution continues under this assumption. If the loop is to execute again, `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2.***
