The variable `be` is incremented by 1, but there is no information about its initial value. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `be` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `be` is increased by 1**
