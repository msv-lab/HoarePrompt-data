According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, and `en` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

Since `j` starts at `be` and increments by 1 for each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to be less than `en`. Given that `en` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, this means `j` needs to be less than `n + 1`, which is not the case here since `j` is already `n + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, the state needs to specify that `en` must be greater than `n + 1`. Additionally, `j` would then be incremented to `n + 1`, which means it will ultimately be equal to `en` on the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` must be greater than `n + 1` for the loop to execute a second time.**
