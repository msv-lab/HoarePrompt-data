The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after execution, `cur` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element of `s` at index `j` is equal to the element of `word` at index `cur`.

Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element of `s` at index `j` is equal to the element of `word` at index `cur`.**
