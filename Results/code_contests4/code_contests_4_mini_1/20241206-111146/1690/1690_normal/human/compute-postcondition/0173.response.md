The variable `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The value of `j` is 0, so `a[j]` is the same as `a[0]`. The value of `tem` is currently 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `tem` will be equal to `a[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`j` is 0, `cur` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `be` is `n` (where `n` is less than 1), `en` is 1, `tem` is `a[0]`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the value of `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]**
