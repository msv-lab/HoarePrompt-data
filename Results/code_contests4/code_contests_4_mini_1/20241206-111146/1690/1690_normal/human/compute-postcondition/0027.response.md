To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the loop structure and the provided initial state.

The loop iterates `n` times, checking the condition of `cur` against `i` and the characters of the string `s` against the `word`. The variable `be` keeps track of how many characters have been checked so far in the string `s`. The loop will either increment `cur` when a character in `s` matches the corresponding character in `word` or increment `be` without changing `cur` when there is no match. If `cur` ever becomes equal to `i`, the loop will terminate early.

- If all characters of `word` are matched within the first `n` characters of `s`, then `cur` will equal `i` at some point, and the loop will stop executing when that happens.
- If the loop runs through all `n` characters and does not find a match for all characters of `word`, `cur` will remain less than `i`.

After considering these points, the final states of the variables will depend on the relationship between `n`, `word`, and `s`.

1. If `cur` reaches `i` within the loop, this means that all characters of `word` have been found in `s` up to the position `j`, resulting in `be` being equal to `cur` (which is `i`).
2. If the loop completes without `cur` reaching `i`, then `cur` will remain less than `i`, and `be` will be equal to `n` (the total number of iterations).

Thus, under the assumption that the loop runs to completion, the output state will accurately reflect either scenario. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is less than or equal to `i`, and `s` contains `n` characters.**
