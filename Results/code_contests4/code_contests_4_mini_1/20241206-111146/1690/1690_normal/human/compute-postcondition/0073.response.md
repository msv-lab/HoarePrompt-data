Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i`, if the element at index `j` of the list `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of the variable `word`, then `cur` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the values of `n`, `j`, and `cur` remain unchanged.***
