According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined in the for loop. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, which means in the next iteration `j` will be decreased by 1, resulting in `j` being `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to run again, as `j` will become 0 for the next execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
