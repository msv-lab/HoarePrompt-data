The value of `en` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `en` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its new value. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `be`, and `cur`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 3`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or 2; `en` is decreased by 1**.
