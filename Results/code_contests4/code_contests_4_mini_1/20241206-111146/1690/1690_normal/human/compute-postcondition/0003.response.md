According to the code, the for loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically 4 times, regardless of the values of `n`, `s`, `a`, or `ans`. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to 3 during the iterations. Since `n` is a positive integer, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are only related to the loop control variable `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length n, `a` is a list of n integers, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
