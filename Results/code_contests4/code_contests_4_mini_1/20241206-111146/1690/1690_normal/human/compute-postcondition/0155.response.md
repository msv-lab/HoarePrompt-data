Postcondition: ***`j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and if the element of `s` at index `j` is equal to the element of `word` at index `cur`, then the conditions hold; otherwise, there are no changes in the program state.***
