`tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`, where `j` is currently 0. The value of `a[0]` will determine the new value of `tem`. The other variables, including `j`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `tem` is increased by `a[0]`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `tem` is increased by `a[0]**
