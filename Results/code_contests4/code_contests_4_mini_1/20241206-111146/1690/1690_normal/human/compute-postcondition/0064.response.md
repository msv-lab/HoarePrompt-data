The variables `be`, `en`, and `tem` are being assigned new values. Specifically:
- `be` is assigned the value `0`.
- `en` is assigned the value of `n`, which is a positive integer.
- `tem` is assigned the value `0`, which indicates it has been reset.

The other variables (`n`, `j`, `cur`, `s`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. The output state will reflect the changes made to `be`, `en`, and `tem` while mentioning the other variables as they were initialized.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is -1, `be` is 0, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` is equal to `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `i` is 4, and the loop cannot execute again.**
