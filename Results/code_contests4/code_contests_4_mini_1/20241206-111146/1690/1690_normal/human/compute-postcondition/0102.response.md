Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed, and `en` is decreased by 1. If `cur` equals `i`, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `cur` becomes 2, `be` remains the same, `en` is decreased by 1, and if `s[j]` equals `word[cur]`, the condition is satisfied, allowing the execution to continue under this assumption, with the requirement that `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.***
