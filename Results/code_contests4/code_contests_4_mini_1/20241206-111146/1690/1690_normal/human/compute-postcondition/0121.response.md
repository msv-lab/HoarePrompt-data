Based on the provided information and the execution of the loop, here is the analysis of the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished:

The loop iterates from `be` to `en`, and during each iteration, if the condition `s[j] == word[i]` is met, `tem` is incremented by the corresponding value from the array `a`. 

1. If `be` is greater than or equal to `en`, the loop does not execute, meaning `tem` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `j` remains at its starting value of `-1`.
2. If the loop executes, `j` will take on values starting from `be` and go up to `en - 1`. The number of iterations executed will depend on the relationship between `be` and `en`.
3. The final value of `tem` will depend on how many times the condition `s[j] == word[i]` is satisfied throughout the iterations.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios:

- If the loop does not execute, `tem` remains unchanged, and the values of `j`, `cur`, `be`, and `en` are as initially stated.
- If the loop executes, `j` will be `en - 1` after the last iteration, `cur` will still be the final value after decrements, `be` will remain at least `0`, `en` will be unchanged but greater than `be`, and `tem` will have accumulated the values based on the conditions met.

Output State: **`j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1` if the loop does not execute, `cur` is the final value after decrements, `be` is at least `0`, `en` is unchanged and greater than `be`, and `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` where `s[j]` equals `word[i]`.**
