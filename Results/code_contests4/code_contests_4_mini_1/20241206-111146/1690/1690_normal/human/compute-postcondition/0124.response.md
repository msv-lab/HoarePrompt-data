The values of the variables are updated as follows: `be` is assigned the value `0`, `en` is assigned the value `n`, and `tem` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `be`, `en`, and `tem` are not specified, but they are directly updated by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is the final value after decrements, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is the final value after decrements, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
