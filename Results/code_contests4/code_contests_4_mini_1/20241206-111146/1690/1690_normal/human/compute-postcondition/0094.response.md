The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was 3, so after execution, `cur` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 2, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`), `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 2, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`), `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`.**
