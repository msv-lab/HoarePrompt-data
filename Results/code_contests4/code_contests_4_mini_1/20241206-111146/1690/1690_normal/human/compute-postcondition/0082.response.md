The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop. Since `n` is a positive integer and `j` is 2, we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.  
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
