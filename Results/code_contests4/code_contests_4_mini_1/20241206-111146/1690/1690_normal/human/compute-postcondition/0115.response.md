According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -1, `be` is at least 0, and `en` is greater than `be`. Since the loop starts at `be`, the next value for `j` will be the current value of `be`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `be`, and `be` must be less than `en`.

State: **`j` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `en` must be greater than 0.**
