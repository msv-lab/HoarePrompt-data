The variable `cur` is assigned the value 0, which does not depend on any prior values. The other variables `j`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
