According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `be` and `en`. The loop will execute if `be` is less than `en`. Given that `j` is initialized to -1, it indicates that the loop will start from `be`, and since `j` will take the value of `be` in the first iteration, `be` must be greater than -1 to ensure that the loop executes at least once.

To summarize:
1. `be` must be less than `en` for the loop to execute.
2. Since `j` starts at -1, we need to ensure that `be` is at least 0 for `j` to take a valid value within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`j` is -1, `cur` is the final value after decrements, `be` is at least 0, `en` is greater than `be`**
