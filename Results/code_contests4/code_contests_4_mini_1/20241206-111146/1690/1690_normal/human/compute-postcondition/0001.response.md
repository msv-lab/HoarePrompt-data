The code snippet defines a new lambda function `rints` that reads a line from standard input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. The initial state variables `n`, `s`, and `a` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `rints` has been defined but does not take effect until it is called.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `a` is a list of n integers corresponding to the ambiguity increase of removing characters from `s`, `rints` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and converts it to a list of integers.**
