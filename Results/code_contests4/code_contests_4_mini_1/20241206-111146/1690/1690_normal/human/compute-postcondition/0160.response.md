The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. Given that `cur` can be either 3 or 2, after execution, it will be either 2 or 1 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is either 2 or 1, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 1`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is either 2 or 1, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 1`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
