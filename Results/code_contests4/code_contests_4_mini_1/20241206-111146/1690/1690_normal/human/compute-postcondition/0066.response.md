According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. The loop variable `j` will start at 0 and be incremented by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Before the loop starts, `j` is currently -1, which is not the value it should have when the loop begins. For the loop to execute correctly for the first time, `j` needs to be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
