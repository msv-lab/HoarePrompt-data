The value of `cur` is assigned to 3, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `be`, `s`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, and `s` contains `n` characters.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, and `s` contains `n` characters**
