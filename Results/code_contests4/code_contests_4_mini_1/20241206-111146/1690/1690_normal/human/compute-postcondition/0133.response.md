Postcondition: ***`j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is 0 or 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, and if `cur` is equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop; otherwise, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`.***
