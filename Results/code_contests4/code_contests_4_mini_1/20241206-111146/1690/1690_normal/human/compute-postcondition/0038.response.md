According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, which means it has been decremented in the loop. Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `n - 2`. Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer, `n - 2` must be non-negative, meaning `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `s` contains `n` characters, and `en` is decreased by 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
