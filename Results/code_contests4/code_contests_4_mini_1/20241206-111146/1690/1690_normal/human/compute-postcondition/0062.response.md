The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `min(ans, tem)`. This means that `ans` will take the smaller value between its current value and `tem`. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. The other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is -1, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` is less than or equal to `n`, `tem` is unchanged, and `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.
