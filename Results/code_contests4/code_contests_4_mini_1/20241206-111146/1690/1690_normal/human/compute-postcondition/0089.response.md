According to the code, the for loop will execute if the range function generates a sequence of numbers. In this case, `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` will generate numbers starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `n - 1` will be at least `0`, ensuring that the loop can execute. The variable `j` is used as the loop variable, and before the loop starts, it should be set to the starting value of `n - 1` to reflect the first iteration. The variable `cur` does not directly affect the execution of the loop but may be relevant within the loop's body. 

The value of `be` (the number of iterations executed) is also not directly relevant for the loop to start executing; however, it indicates how many iterations might have occurred before.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `j` should be initialized to `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`)**
