The variable `en` is decreased by 1, affecting its previous value. The other variables `n`, `j`, `cur`, and `be` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `en`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed, and `en` is decreased by 1.**
