To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we will analyze the provided loop code and the given output states after a few iterations.

1. The loop iterates through the range of `n`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will execute at most `n` times.
2. The loop has a condition `if cur == i` that can cause a break if `cur` is equal to `i`. Since `cur` starts at 0 and `i` is 4, the loop will continue until `cur` reaches 4 or until `j` reaches `n`.
3. The second condition, `elif s[j] == word[cur]`, checks if the current character in `s` matches the current character in `word`. If it matches, `cur` is incremented.
4. For each iteration of the loop, `be` is incremented regardless of whether the character matches or not. 

From the output states provided after executing the loop 1, 2, and 3 times:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is 0, `be` is 1.
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 1, `be` is 2.
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 2, `be` is 3.

We can infer that:
- After `n` iterations, if `cur` has not reached `i` (which is 4), `j` will be equal to `n` and `be` will be `n`.
- If `cur` reaches 4 during the iterations (meaning enough matching characters were found in `s`), then the loop breaks early.

Since `n` is a positive integer, we need to consider two scenarios:
1. If `cur` reaches 4 before `j` reaches `n`, then `j` will be less than `n`, and `be` will be the number of iterations until the break.
2. If `cur` does not reach 4, then after `n` iterations, `j` will equal `n`, and `be` will equal `n`.

The final output state will depend on whether `cur` equals `i` after all iterations. However, as `n` is defined as a positive integer, we can summarize the output state more generally.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `cur` is less than or equal to `4`, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`).**
