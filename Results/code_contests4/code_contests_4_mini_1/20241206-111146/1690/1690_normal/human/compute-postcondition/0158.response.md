According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, which means it is currently pointing to the last index (assuming `n` is at least 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decreased by 1. This means that after the next iteration, `j` will become `n - 2`. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be at least 0, so `n` must be greater than 1 (since `j` starts at `n - 1`).

State: **`j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 1`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
