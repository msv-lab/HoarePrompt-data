To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider how the variables change throughout the loop execution based on the provided code.

1. The loop runs from `j = n - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `j` in each iteration.
2. The loop checks if `cur` equals `i`. If it does, the loop breaks.
3. If `cur` does not equal `i`, it checks if `s[j]` equals `word[cur]`. If they are equal, `cur` is decremented.
4. Regardless of whether the condition is met or not, `en` is decremented in each iteration.
5. The loop continues until `j` reaches `-1` or until a break condition is met.

Given the output states provided for the first few iterations, we can deduce the following:

- If the loop executes all `n` iterations without hitting the break condition, `j` will end up as `-1`, `cur` will remain unchanged if `s[j]` never matched `word[cur]`, and `en` will be decreased by `n`.
- If the break condition is hit before the loop completes, `j` will reflect the last value it had before the break occurred, `cur` will be decremented based on how many times it matched, and `en` will have been decremented accordingly.

Thus, if the loop executes fully, we have:

- `j` will be `-1` (indicating the end of the range).
- `cur` will be whatever it was after the last successful match or remain at its initial value if there were none.
- `en` will be `en - n`.

If the loop does not execute at all, `j` will remain less than or equal to `n - 1`, `cur` will remain 3, and `en` will remain unchanged.

Considering these deductions, we conclude that:

Output State: **`j` is -1, `cur` is the final value after decrements, `be` is equal to the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`), `en` is decreased by the number of iterations executed.**
