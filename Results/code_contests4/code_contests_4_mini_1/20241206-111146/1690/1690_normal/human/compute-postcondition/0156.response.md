Postcondition: ***`j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the element of `s` at index `j` is equal to the element of `word` at index `cur`, the conditions hold; otherwise, there are no changes in the program state.***
