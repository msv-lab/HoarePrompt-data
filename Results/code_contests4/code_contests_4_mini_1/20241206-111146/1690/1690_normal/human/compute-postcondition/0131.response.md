`cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 0, so after execution, `cur` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`.

Output State: **`j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` of `word`.**
