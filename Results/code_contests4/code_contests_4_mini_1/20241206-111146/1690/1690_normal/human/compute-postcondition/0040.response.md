The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after executing `cur -= 1`, the new value of `cur` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 2, `s` contains `n` characters, and `en` is decreased by 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 2, `s` contains `n` characters, and `en` is decreased by 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
