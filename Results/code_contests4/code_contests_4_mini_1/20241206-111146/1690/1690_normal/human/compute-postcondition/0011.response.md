The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `j`, and the conditions regarding `s` and `word` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word.**
