According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range defined in the for loop. The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer, and `j` is currently `n - 2`, for the loop to execute once more, `n` must be at least 3 (which keeps `j` non-negative). 

At the end of the last iteration, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, and `en` has been decreased by 1, but these values do not need to change for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 3`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
