The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `tem + a[j]`. The previous value of `tem` is `a[0]`, and `j` is 1, which means we need to access the second element of the array `a`. The value of `a[1]` is not provided, so we denote it as `a[1]`. Therefore, `tem` will be updated to `a[0] + a[1]`. The values of the other variables (`j`, `cur`, `be`, `en`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is 1, `cur` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `be` is `n` (where `n` is less than 1), `en` is 1, `tem` is `a[0] + a[1]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
