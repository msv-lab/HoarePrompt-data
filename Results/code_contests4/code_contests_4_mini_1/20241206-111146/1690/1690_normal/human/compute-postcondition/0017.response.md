The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. The variable `n` is a positive integer and `j` is 1, but they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `cur` is increased by 1**
