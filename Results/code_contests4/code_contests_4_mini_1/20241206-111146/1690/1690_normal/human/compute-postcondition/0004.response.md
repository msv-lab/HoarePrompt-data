The variables `be`, `en`, and `tem` are assigned the values 0, `n`, and 0, respectively. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is float('inf'), `word` is 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0**
