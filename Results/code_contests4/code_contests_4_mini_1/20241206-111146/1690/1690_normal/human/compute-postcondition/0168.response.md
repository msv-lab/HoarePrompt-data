Postcondition: ***`j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 2`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `cur` equals `i`, we break out of the most internal loop. If `cur` is 2 or 1, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the values of `j`, `cur`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, and `ans` remain as described.***
