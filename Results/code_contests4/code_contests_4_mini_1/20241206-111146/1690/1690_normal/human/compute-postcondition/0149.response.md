According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j` and is set to iterate from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0` since `j` starts at `n - 1`. 

In the given state before the loop starts:
- `j` is `n - 1`, which is a valid starting point.
- `cur` is `3`, which doesn’t directly affect the loop execution.
- `be` is `n` and `en` is `n`, which are not directly relevant for the loop execution.
- `tem` is `0`, which also does not influence the loop’s ability to execute.
- `ans` remains unchanged, indicating it is not relevant to the loop execution.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least `1`, which would make `j = n - 1` a non-negative integer (i.e., starting from `0` or higher). Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `n` is greater than `0`, and `j` will initially be `n - 1`.

State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` is n, `en` is n, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0**
