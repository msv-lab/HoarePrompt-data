The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `cur`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The values of the other variables (`j` and `n`) are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, and `cur` is increased by 1 without a specific previous value.

Output State: **`j` is 1, and `cur` is increased by 1 without a specific previous value.**
