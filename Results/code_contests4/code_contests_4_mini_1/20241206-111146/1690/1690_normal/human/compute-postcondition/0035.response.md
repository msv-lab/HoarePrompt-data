Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `s` contains `n` characters, and `cur` is not equal to `i`. If the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in `word`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
