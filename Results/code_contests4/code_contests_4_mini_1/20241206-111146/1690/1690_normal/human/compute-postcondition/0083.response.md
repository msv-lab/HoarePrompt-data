The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. Additionally, the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `cur` is increased by 1**
