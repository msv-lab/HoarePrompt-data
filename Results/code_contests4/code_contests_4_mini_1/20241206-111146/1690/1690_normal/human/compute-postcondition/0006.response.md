According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, it implies that `n` is at least 1. This means the loop will execute exactly `n` times, starting with `j` initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, and `j` will also be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. The other variables (`s`, `a`, `ans`, `word`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, and `cur`) do not affect whether the loop can execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` being a positive integer ensures that `j` will start from 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
