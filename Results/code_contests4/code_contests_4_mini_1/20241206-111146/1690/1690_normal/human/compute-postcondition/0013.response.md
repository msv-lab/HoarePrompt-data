Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, then `cur` is incremented by 1. If they are not equal, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
