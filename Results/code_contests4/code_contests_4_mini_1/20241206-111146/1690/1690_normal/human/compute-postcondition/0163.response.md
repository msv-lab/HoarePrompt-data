The value of `en` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `en` is `n - 1`, so after execution, `en` becomes `n - 2`. The other variables (`j`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 2`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 2`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
