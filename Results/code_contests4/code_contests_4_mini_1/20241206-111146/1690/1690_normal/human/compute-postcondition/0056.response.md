In this case, `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`. The value of `j` is `n + 1`, so we need to evaluate `a[j]`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `j` will also be a positive integer, and thus we can use `a[j]` directly. 

The values of `n`, `cur`, `s`, `be`, and `en` do not change as a result of this operation, but `tem` is updated. The output state reflects the updated value of `tem`, but without knowing the specific value of `a[j]`, we cannot determine the exact increment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` is less than or equal to `n + 1, and `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` is less than or equal to `n + 1, and `tem` is incremented by `a[j]`.**
