The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 2`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `s` contains `n` characters, and `en` is decreased by 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
