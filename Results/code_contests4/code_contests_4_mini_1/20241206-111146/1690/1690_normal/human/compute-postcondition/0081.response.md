According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the number `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
