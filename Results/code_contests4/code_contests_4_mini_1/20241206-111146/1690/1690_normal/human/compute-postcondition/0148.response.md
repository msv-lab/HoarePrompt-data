The value of `cur` is assigned the value of 3. The previous value of `cur` is not defined, so after execution, `cur` will be 3. The values of other variables (`j`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged**.
