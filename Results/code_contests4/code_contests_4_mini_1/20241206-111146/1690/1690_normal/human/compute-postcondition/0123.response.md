According to the code, the for loop will execute for `i` in the range of 4, which means it will iterate for `i` values 0, 1, 2, and 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is the final value after decrements, `be` is at least 0, `en` is unchanged and greater than `be`, and `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` where `s[j]` equals `word[i]`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Since the loop has executed for `i` values 0, 1, 2, and 3 already, it cannot execute again because the next value of `i` would be 4, which is outside the specified range.

Therefore, the loop cannot be executed one more time as it has already reached its limit.

State: **`j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is the final value after decrements, `be` is at least `0`, `en` is unchanged and greater than `be`, `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` where `s[j]` equals `word[3]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, for the loop to execute a fifth time `i` must be less than 4.**
