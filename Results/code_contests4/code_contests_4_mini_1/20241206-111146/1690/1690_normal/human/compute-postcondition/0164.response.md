According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. This means `j` will become `n - 3`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be at least 0. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (since `j` will be `n - 3`).

The values of `cur`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, and `ans` remain unchanged. 

State: **`j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 2`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
