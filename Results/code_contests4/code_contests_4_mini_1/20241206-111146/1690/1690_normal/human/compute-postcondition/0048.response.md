Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 3`, `be` is equal to `n`, and `cur` is either 3 or 2. If `cur` equals `i`, the most internal loop is broken. If `cur` is 2 and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the conditions still hold such that for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.***
