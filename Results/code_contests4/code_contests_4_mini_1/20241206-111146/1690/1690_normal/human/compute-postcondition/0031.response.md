The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `s` contains `n` characters, and `cur` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
