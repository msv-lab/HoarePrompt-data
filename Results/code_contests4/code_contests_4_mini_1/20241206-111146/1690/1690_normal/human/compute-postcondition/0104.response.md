According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`, which means it is currently `n - 2` and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `n - 3` (after decrementing by 1).

Additionally, `n` is a positive integer, so it must be at least 3 for `j` to be non-negative. 

After the current iteration, `en` is decreased by 1, but since `en` is not directly relevant for the next iteration of `j`, we focus on `j` and `n`. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `n - 3` and it must be confirmed that `n` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed, and `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 3.**
