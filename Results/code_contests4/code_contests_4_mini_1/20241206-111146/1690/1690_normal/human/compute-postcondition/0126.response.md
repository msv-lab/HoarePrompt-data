According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `j` is set to either `en - 1` or `be - 1`, but this is irrelevant for the loop execution since `j` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `cur` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

State: **`j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1`, `cur` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0, and the first iteration will set `j` to 0.**
