According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, `be` is equal to `n`, and `en` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented, which will make it equal to `n + 1`, and `en` must still be less than or equal to `n + 1` for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, we need to set `j` to `n + 1` and ensure that `en` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` is less than or equal to `n + 1, if the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of `word`, then `tem` is incremented by `a[n]`.**
