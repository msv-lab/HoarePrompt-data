Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, and `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`). If `cur` is equal to `i`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i`, the program checks if the element at index `j` of `s` equals the element at index `cur` of `word`, and if they are equal, the condition is satisfied. If they are not equal, no alternative action is taken.***
