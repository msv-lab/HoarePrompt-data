The variable `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. Since `j` is defined as `n + 1`, `a[j]` refers to the value at index `n + 1` in the list `a`. The impact of this code depends on the values of the variables and the list `a`. However, we don't have specified values for `a` or `tem`, but we know that `n` is a positive integer and `j` is `n + 1`. 

Since `a` could contain values based on the context, we cannot definitively determine the exact value that `tem` will take after this operation, but we know that `tem` will increase by the value of `a[n + 1]`. 

The state of other variables (`n`, `j`, `be`, `cur`, `s`, `en`) remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` must be greater than `n + 1` for the loop to execute a second time; `tem` is increased by `a[n + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` must be greater than `n + 1` for the loop to execute a second time; `tem` is increased by `a[n + 1]`.**
