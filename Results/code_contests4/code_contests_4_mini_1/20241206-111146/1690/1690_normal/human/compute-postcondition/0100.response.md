The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 3, so after execution, `cur` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is 2, `be` is the number of iterations executed, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
