Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed, and `en` is decreased by 1. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is 2, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the state of the program reflects that condition; otherwise, no action is taken.***
