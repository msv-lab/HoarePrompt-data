Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n - 1`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`), and `cur` is not equal to `i`. If the element at index `j` of `s` is equal to the element at index `cur` of `word`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the program does not execute any alternative action since there is no else part.***
