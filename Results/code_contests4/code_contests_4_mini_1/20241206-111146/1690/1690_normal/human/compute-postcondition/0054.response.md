Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` is less than `n`, if the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of `word`, then `tem` is incremented by `a[n]`.***
