According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` which is currently `en - 1` or `be - 1`. Given that `be` is 1 and `en` is `n`, we can infer that `j` is currently `0` (if `en` is equal to `n`). 

At the end of the last iteration, if `j` is `en - 1`, it indicates that `j` is the maximum value it can take before the loop exits. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, the current value of `j` must be incremented to allow for the loop to execute one more time. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being `1`. Additionally, since the loop must execute while `j` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than `1`.

State: **`j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
