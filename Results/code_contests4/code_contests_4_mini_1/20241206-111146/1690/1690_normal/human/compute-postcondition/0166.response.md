`cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` can either be 3 or 2, so after execution, `cur` will be either 2 or 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is either 2 or 1, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 2`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is either 2 or 1, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 2`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
