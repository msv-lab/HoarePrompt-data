According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, and the variable `j` will be incremented by 1 to become 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
