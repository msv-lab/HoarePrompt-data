The value of `be` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `be` is unknown, as it was not provided in the initial state. The values of `n`, `j`, `cur`, and `s[j]` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `cur` is unchanged, and `be` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `cur` is unchanged, and `be` is increased by 1**
