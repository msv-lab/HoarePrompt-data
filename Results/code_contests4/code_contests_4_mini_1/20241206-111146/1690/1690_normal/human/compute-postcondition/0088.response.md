The variable `cur` is assigned the value `3`. The previous value of `cur` was less than or equal to `4`, but now it is specifically set to `3`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `be`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `be` is the number of iterations executed (which is at most `n`.**
