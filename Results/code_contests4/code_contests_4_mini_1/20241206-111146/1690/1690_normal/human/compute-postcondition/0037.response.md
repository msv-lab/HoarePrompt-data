The variable `en` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `en` is not provided in the initial state. Since the other variables (`n`, `j`, `be`, `cur`, `s`) remain unchanged, we cannot determine the specific value of `en` after decrementing. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `en` without a specific value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `s` contains `n` characters, and `en` is decreased by 1.**
