According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `en` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1. So, after this iteration, `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `en`, which means `en` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `en` must be greater than 1**.
