The code `tem += a[j]` attempts to add the value of `a[j]` to `tem`. However, since `j` is 1 and the loop cannot execute again because `j` is not less than `en` (which is 1), the code does not actually execute. Therefore, no changes are made to `tem`, and the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `cur` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `be` is `n` (where `n` is less than 1), `en` is 1, and the code `tem += a[j]` does not execute.**
