`cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The value of `j` remains 2, and the condition for the loop to execute a second time is based on `n`, which remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `cur` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`j` is 2, `cur` is increased by 1**
