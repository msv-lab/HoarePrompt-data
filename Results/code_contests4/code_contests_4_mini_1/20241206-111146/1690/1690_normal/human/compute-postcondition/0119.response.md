`tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The value of `j` is 1, so `tem` is increased by `a[1]`. The state of `a` is not specified, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `tem` is increased by `a[1]`, and `en` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time. 

Output State: **`j` is 1, `tem` is increased by `a[1]`, and `en` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
