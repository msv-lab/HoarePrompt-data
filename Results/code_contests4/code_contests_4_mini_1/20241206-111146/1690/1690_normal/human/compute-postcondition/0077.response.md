The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. Since the loop is set to execute a second time only if `n` is greater than 1, we can conclude that the execution can proceed under that condition. The values of the other variables (`n` and `j`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `cur` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `cur` is increased by 1**
