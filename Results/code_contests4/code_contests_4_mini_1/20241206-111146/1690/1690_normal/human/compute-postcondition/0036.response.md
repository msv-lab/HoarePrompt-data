Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is 3, `s` contains `n` characters. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i`, the program checks if the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in `word`; if they are equal, the condition is satisfied, and if not, no action is taken.***
