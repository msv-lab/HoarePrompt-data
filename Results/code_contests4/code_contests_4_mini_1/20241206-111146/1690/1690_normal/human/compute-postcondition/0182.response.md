The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` is 0, and since `ans` remains unchanged, the previous value of `ans` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is either unchanged or could be updated to 0 if it was greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`j` is -1, `cur` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `be` is `n`, `en` is 1, `tem` is 0, and `ans` is either unchanged or updated to min(ans, 0)**.
