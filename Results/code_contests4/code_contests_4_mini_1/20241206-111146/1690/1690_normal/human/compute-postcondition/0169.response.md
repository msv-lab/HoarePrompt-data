The operation `en -= 1` decrements the value of `en` by 1. The variable `en` was previously assigned the value `n - 2`, so after execution, its new value becomes `(n - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. The other variables (`j`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 3`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n - 3`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 3`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
