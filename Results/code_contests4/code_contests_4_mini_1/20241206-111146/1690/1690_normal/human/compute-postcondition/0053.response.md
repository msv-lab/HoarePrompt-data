The variable `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, we use the value of `a[n]` for this operation. The values of `n`, `j`, `be`, `cur`, `s`, and `en` remain unchanged, but we are updating `tem`. The specific value of `a[n]` is not given, so we cannot specify the exact value of `tem` after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `be` is equal to `n`, `cur` is either 3 or a lower value, `s` contains `n` characters, `en` is less than `n`, the character at index `j` of `s` is equal to the character at index `i` of `word`, and `tem` is incremented by `a[n]`.**
