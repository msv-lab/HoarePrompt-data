The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is defined as the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` where `s[j]` equals `word[i]`, the value of `tem` is known. The values of `j`, `cur`, `be`, and `en` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `en - 1` or `be - 1` if the loop does not execute; `cur` is the final value after decrements; `be` is at least `0`; `en` is unchanged and greater than `be`; `tem` is the sum of `a[j]` for all indices `j` where `s[j]` equals `word[i]`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.
