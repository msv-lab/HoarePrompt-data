Postcondition: ***`j` is `n - 2`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `be` is `n`, `en` is `n - 1`, `tem` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `cur` equals `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is either 2 or 1 and `s[j]` equals `word[cur]`, the conditions regarding `j`, `cur`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
