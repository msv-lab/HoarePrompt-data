According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the positive integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `be` has been incremented by 1, but since `be` does not affect the loop directly, we focus on `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Currently, `j` is 0, so after incrementing it for the next iteration, `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
