To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the key requirements and behavior of the program.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Structure**:
   - An integer `n` representing the length of the string.
   - A string `s` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters.
   - A list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `a[i]` corresponds to the ambiguity increase of removing the i-th character.

2. **Output Requirement**:
   - The output must be the minimum ambiguity of the statement after removing characters such that the resulting string does not contain the subsequence "hard".

3. **Subsequence Check**:
   - The program must identify characters that contribute to the subsequence "hard" and calculate the total ambiguity incurred by removing them.

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes several variables, including the string `word` set to "hard".

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program runs a loop four times (for each character in "hard"), attempting to find the positions of the characters in the string `s` both from the start and from the end.
   - It calculates the ambiguity for removing characters that contribute to forming the subsequence "hard".

3. **Ambiguity Calculation**:
   - The program correctly tracks the indices of characters in `s` that match the characters in "hard" and sums the corresponding ambiguity values from list `a`.
   - It maintains a running minimum of this ambiguity.

### Potential Issues
- **Boundary Conditions**: The program assumes that it will always find valid indices for each character in "hard". However, if the string does not contain enough characters to form "hard", it could lead to incorrect calculations or an assumption that there are characters to remove.
- **Correctness of `cur` Indexing**: The way `cur` is managed may lead to cases where it does not properly assess the characters if the count of matched characters is less than expected.
  
### Conclusion
The program attempts to find characters that can be removed to prevent the formation of the subsequence "hard". However, it does not account for situations where the string `s` does not contain sufficient characters to match the subsequence. 

For instance, in cases where `s` is missing one or more letters from "hard", the program may still attempt to calculate ambiguity without correctly identifying that "hard" cannot be formed, leading to potentially incorrect results.

Given these considerations, the program does not conform strictly to the requirements laid out in the problem description in all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
