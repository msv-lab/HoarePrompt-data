The `temp` list is modified by appending the value of `one` to it. Since `one` is set to either 1 or 0 based on the first character of `s`, the value appended to `temp` will be either 1 or 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is set to 1 or 0 based on the first character of `s`; `res` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `temp` now contains either one element which is 1 or 0; `tar` is 0; the substring `s[i - 1:i + 2]` does not equal '101'; `s[i]` is '0'; and `tar` is 1.
