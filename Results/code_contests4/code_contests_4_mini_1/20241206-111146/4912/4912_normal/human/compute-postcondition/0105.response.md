To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state of the variable `f` based on the value of `m`. 

1. If `m` is 2, `f` contains one element: `[x[1], max(x[2], x[0])]`.
2. If `m` is 4, 3, or any other value not equal to 2, `f` contains two elements: `[[x[0], x[1]], [x[1], max(x[2], x[0])]]`.

Now, we look at the code snippet:

```
f.append(x[0] + x[2], x[3] + f[0])
```

This line appends two values to the list `f`:
- The first value is `x[0] + x[2]`.
- The second value is `x[3] + f[0]`, where `f[0]` refers to the first element of the list `f`.

The structure of `f` changes based on the initial state:
- If `m` is 2, `f` originally has one element, and after the append operation, it will have three elements.
- If `m` is 4, 3, or any other value not equal to 2, `f` originally has two elements, and after the append operation, it will have four elements.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the specific values of `x` and the structure of `f` before the append operation.

Output State: **`f` is either three elements: `[x[1], max(x[2], x[0]), x[0] + x[2], x[3] + f[0]]` (if `m` is 2) or four elements: `[[x[0], x[1]], [x[1], max(x[2], x[0])], x[0] + x[2], x[3] + f[0]]` (if `m` is 4, 3, or any other value not equal to 2)**.
