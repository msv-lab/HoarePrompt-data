Output State: **`m` is the length of `x`, `temp` is initialized to the maximum of `x[0]` and `x[1]` if `m` equals 2, and `f` is an empty list. Since `m` is not equal to 2, `temp` remains unchanged and initialized to 0, and `f` remains an empty list. `temp` is now assigned the value max(x[0], x[1], x[2]) which is calculated based on the values of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`.**
