Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `s` is an input string from the user with last character '1'; `tar` is 1; `one` is greater than 0. If `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `f` contains its original values plus two new values appended for each iteration, and `temp` is assigned the maximum value among `f[-1][0]`, `f[-1][1]`, and `f[-2][0]`. If `m` is less than 5, `f` remains unchanged, and `temp` retains its previous value.***
