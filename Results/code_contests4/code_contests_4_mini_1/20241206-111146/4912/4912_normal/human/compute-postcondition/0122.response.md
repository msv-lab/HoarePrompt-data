The code initializes an empty list `f`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as no other variables are modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the length of `x`; `temp` is initialized to 0; `f` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is the length of `x`; `temp` is initialized to 0; `f` is an empty list.**
