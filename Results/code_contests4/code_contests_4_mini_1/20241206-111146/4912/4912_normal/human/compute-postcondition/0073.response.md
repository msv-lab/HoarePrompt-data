Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `s` is an input string from the user with last character '1'; `tar` is 1; `one` is greater than 0; `m` equals 4; the values of `temp`, `res`, and other variables remain unchanged. If `m` equals 3, then `temp` is set to the maximum value of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`, and `res` now contains a copy of `temp` which is also 0.***
