Postcondition: ***`m` is the length of `x`, where `x` is an element in `res` and `f` is an empty list. If `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `f` is updated with appended values from the loop, and `temp` is the maximum of `f[-1][0]`, `f[-1][1]`, and `f[-2][0]`. If `m` is less than 5, no changes are made to `f` or `temp`.***
