Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is set to 1 or 0 based on the first character of `s`; if `s[i]` is not '1', then `res`, `count`, `temp`, and `tar` remain unchanged; `temp` is still an empty list, `tar` is 0, and the substring `s[i - 1:i + 2]` does not equal '101'.***
