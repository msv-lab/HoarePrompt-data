Postcondition: ***`m` is the length of `x`. If `m` equals 3, `temp` is assigned the value of the maximum of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`, while `f` remains an empty list. If `m` is not equal to 3, the values of `temp` and `f` remain unchanged, with `temp` still initialized to 0 and `f` as an empty list.***
