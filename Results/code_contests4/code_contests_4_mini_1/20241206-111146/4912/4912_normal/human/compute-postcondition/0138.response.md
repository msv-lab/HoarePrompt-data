According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 4 and increments with each iteration until it reaches `m - 1`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 3 and `i` is currently 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 5, and for the loop to continue executing, `m` must be greater than 5.

State: **`m` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 5**
