The value of `one` is explicitly set to 0. Since this is an assignment statement, it does not affect the previous values of `S`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `res`, `count`, `temp`, or `tar`. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is 0; `temp` is still an empty list; `tar` is 0; and `res`, `count` remain unchanged.
