Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `s` is an input string from the user. If the last character of `s` is '1', then `one` is increased by 1, `res` is updated to contain lists of counts of '1's collected after each occurrence of '101', `count` remains 0, and `temp` is either an empty list or contains the last counted '1's. If the last character is not '1', there are no changes made to `one`, `res`, `count`, or `temp`.***
