According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as the range `3` to `m - 1` has at least one valid index, which means that `m` must be greater than `3`. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at `3` when the loop executes for the first time. 

So, for the loop to be executed at least once, `m` must be greater than `3`, and at the beginning of the loop, `i` will be `3`. 

State: **`m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
