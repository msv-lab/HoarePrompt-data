According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `m`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is greater than 3, meaning that `m` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again. In this case, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must become 4, and for the loop condition to hold, `m` must be greater than 4.

State: **`m` is greater than 3, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 4**
