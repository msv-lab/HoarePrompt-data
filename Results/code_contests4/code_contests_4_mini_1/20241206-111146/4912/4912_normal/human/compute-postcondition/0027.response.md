Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `s` is an input string from the user; if `s[i]` is '1', then `one` is increased by 1, and if `s[i]` is '0' and `tar` is 1, then `res` contains the copied value of `temp`, `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is 0, and the substring `s[i - 1:i + 2]` does not equal '101'. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is not '1', then `one` remains 0, `temp` is still an empty list, `tar` is 0, `res` remains unchanged, and `count` remains unchanged.***
