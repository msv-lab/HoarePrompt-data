Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 3; `s` is an input string from the user. If the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` equals '101', then `tar` is set to 1 and `one` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is '1', `one` is increased by 1; if `s[i]` is not '1', then `one` is set to 0, `temp` is an empty list, and `res` remains unchanged, while `tar` is unchanged.***
