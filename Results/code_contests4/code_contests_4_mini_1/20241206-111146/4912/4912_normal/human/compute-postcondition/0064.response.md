The value of `temp` is assigned the value `0`, which means that its previous value (that was `one` appended to it) is replaced. The other variables (`S`, `n`, `s`, `tar`, `one`, and `res`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `s` is an input string from the user with last character '1'; `tar` is 1; `one` is greater than 0; `temp` is now 0; `res` now contains a copy of `temp` which would now also be 0.
