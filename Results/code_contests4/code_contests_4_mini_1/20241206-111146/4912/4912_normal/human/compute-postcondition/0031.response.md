The variable `temp` is being modified by appending the value of `one` to it. However, the state of `temp` is not defined in the initial state, and there is no prior context for the variable `one`. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific impact on `temp`, but we note that `one` is added to `temp`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `s` is an input string from the user; `tar` is assigned the value 1; `one` is appended to `temp`.**
