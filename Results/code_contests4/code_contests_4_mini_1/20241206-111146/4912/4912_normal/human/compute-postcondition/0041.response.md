Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `s` is an input string from the user. If the substring `s[i - 1:i + 2]` equals '101', then `tar` is assigned the value 1, `one` is 0, and `temp` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is '1', then `tar` is 1 and `one` is increased by 1; if `s[i]` is not '1', then `tar` is either 0 or 1 and `one` is set to 0. `temp` is an empty list, and `res` contains a copy of the previous `temp`.***
