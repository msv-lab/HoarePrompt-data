Postcondition: ***`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `s` is an input string from the user. If `tar` is equal to 1, `one` is increased by 1 if the last character of `s` is '1'; `res` is updated to contain lists of counts of '1's collected after each occurrence of '101'; `count` remains 0; `temp` is either an empty list or contains the last counted '1's; `temp` now contains the value of `one` appended to it; `res` now contains a copy of `temp`. If `tar` is not equal to 1, there are no changes made to `one`, `res`, `count`, or `temp`.***
