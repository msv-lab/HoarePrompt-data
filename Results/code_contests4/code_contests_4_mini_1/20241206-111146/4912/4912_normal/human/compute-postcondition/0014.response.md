The value of `one` is appended to the list `temp`. The previous value of `temp` is an empty list, so after execution, `temp` will contain the value of `one`, which is either 1 or 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is set to 1 or 0 based on the first character of `s`; `res` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `temp` is either [1] or [0]; `tar` is 1; the substring of `s` from index `i-1` to `i+2` is equal to '101'.
