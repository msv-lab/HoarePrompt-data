The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged as the initialization does not affect `S`, `n`, `i`, `s`, or `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 3; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is appended to `temp`; `res` now contains a copy of `temp`; `temp` is an empty list.
