To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet provided and the initial state of the variable `f`.

### Initial State:
- `f` has been updated to include the list `[x[0], x[1]]` and now also includes `[x[1], max(x[2], x[0])]`.

### Code Snippet:
```
f.append(x[0] + x[2], x[3] + f[0])
```

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Impact of the code**: The `append` method is being called on the list `f`. This method adds the specified elements to the end of the list.
2. **Elements being appended**: Two values are being appended:
   - The first value is `x[0] + x[2]`.
   - The second value is `x[3] + f[0]`. Here, `f[0]` refers to the first element of `f`, which currently is `x[0]` (since `f` contains `[x[0], x[1], ...]`).
3. **Effect on `f`**: The values will be calculated based on the current values of `x[0]`, `x[2]`, and `x[3]`. The updated list `f` will now include these two new values at the end.

### Conclusion:
After executing the code, the list `f` will have two new elements appended based on the calculations involving `x` and the existing value of `f[0]`. However, without specific values for `x[0]`, `x[2]`, and `x[3]`, we cannot provide the exact numerical values in the output state.

**Output State: `f` has been updated to include the new values based on `x[0] + x[2]` and `x[3] + x[0]`.**
