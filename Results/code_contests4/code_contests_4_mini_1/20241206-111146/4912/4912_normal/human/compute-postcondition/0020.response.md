The code `temp = []` initializes `temp` as an empty list. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. The previous value of `temp` is either 1 or 0, but it will be replaced with an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is set to 1 or 0 based on the first character of `s`; `res` now contains the copied value of `temp`; `count` is 0; `temp` is now an empty list; `tar` is 1; the substring `s[i - 1:i + 2]` does not equal '101'; `s[i]` is '0'; and `tar` is 1.
