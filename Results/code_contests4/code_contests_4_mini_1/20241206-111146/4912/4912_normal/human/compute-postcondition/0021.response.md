The value of `tar` is assigned to 0, changing its previous value of 1 to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is set to 1 or 0 based on the first character of `s`; `res` now contains the copied value of `temp`; `count` is 0; `temp` is now an empty list; `tar` is 0; the substring `s[i - 1:i + 2]` does not equal '101'; `s[i]` is '0'; and `tar` is now 0.
