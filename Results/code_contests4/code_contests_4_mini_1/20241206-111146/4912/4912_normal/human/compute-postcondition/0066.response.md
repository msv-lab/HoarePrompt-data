The code initializes an empty list `f`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. Thus, the state of the other variables remains intact.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `s` is an input string from the user with last character '1'; `tar` is 1; `one` is greater than 0; `temp` is now 0; `res` now contains a copy of `temp` which is also 0; `m` is the length of `x`, which is unknown; `f` is an empty list.**
