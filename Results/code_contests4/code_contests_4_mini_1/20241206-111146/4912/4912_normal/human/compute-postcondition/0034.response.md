The code `res.append(temp.copy())` takes the current value of `temp`, creates a copy of it, and appends that copy to the list `res`. The previous values of the affected variables, specifically `temp`, remain unchanged. The variable `res` is modified to include a new element, which is a copy of `temp`. Since `temp` has `one` appended to it, the new element added to `res` will reflect that value. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `s` is an input string from the user; `temp` has `one` appended to it; `res` now contains a copy of `temp`.**
