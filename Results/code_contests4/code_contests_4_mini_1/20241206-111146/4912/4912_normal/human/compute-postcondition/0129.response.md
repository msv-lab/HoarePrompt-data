To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial conditions and the effect of the provided code snippet. 

1. The initial state describes that `m` is the length of `x`. If `m` equals 4, then `temp` is assigned a value based on elements of `x`, and `f` is an empty list. If `m` is not equal to 4, `temp` remains 0, and `f` is also an empty list.
2. The code snippet `f.append([x[0], x[1]])` is executed.

Assuming `m` is equal to 4, the following happens:
- `f` is modified to include a new list containing `x[0]` and `x[1]`. 
- The value of `temp` is not directly affected by this operation, and the initial values of `temp` and `f` do not change the fact that `f` now contains one new entry.

Assuming `m` is not equal to 4, then `f` remains an empty list, and the operation `f.append([x[0], x[1]])` modifies `f` to include one new entry but does not change `temp`, which remains 0.

In both cases, `temp`'s value is not directly affected by the append operation.

Considering both scenarios, we summarize the outputs:

Output State: **`m` is the length of `x`; `f` contains one entry [x[0], x[1]] if `m` equals 4, otherwise `f` contains one entry [x[0], x[1]] and `temp` remains 0.**
