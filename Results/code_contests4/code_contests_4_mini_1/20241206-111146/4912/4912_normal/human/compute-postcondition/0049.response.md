The variable `tar` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for all other variables.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 3; `s` is an input string from the user; `one` is appended to `temp`; `res` now contains a copy of `temp`; `temp` is an empty list; `tar` is 0**
