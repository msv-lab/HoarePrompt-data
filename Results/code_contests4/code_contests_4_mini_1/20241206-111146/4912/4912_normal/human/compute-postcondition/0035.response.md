The code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous value of `temp` was a list with the string `one` appended to it. Thus, after execution, `temp` is now an empty list, and the states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `s` is an input string from the user; `temp` is now an empty list; `res` still contains a copy of the previous `temp`.
