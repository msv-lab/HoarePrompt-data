The `temp` variable is assigned an empty list. This operation does not affect any of the other variables (`S`, `n`, `s`, `one`, `res`, `count`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for all other variables.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, ending with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string from the user; if the first character of `s` is '1', then `one` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `s` does not start with '1', `one` is set to 0; `res` remains an empty list; `count` is 0; `temp` is an empty list.**
