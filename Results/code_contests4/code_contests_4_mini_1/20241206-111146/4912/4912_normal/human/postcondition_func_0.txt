The function accepts a string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 9 and 50 characters, ending with 'FESTIVAL'. It counts occurrences of the pattern '101' in the string and sums the maximum counts of consecutive '1's that appear between these '101' patterns. The final count is printed. If the string does not contain the '101' pattern, the count remains 0. If the string ends with '1' after the last '101', this is also accounted for in the count.
