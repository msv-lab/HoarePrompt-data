The function `func_20` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, constrained between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it also accepts three additional positive integer parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the three fence segments, each constrained between 1 and 10^9.

Based on the input parameters, the function evaluates the conditions for each test case and returns specific results. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_20` is to accept a positive integer `t` and for each test case defined by the positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, it checks whether these lengths can form a triangle and returns the appropriate result for each test case.
