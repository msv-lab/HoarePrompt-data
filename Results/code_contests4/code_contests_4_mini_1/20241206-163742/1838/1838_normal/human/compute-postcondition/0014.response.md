According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args`. If `args` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in `args` and `at_start` will remain False. The loop will continue until all elements in `args` have been processed.

State: **`t`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute again `args` must contain at least one more element.**
