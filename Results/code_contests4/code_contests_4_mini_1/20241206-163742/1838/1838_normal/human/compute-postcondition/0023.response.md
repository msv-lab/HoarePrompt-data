Postcondition: ***`t`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; the 'end' key is removed from `kwargs`, and `file` has written the value associated with 'end' or a newline character. If the flush option in kwargs is set to True, the contents of `file` have been flushed.***
