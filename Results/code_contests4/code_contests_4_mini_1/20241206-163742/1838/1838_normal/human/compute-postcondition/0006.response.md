Postcondition: ***`t`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; if `at_start` is False, then `file` writes the value of `sep`. Otherwise, `at_start` is True, and the first execution of the loop occurs with `args` as a non-empty iterable where `x` is the first element.***
