Functionality: ** The function `func_20` accepts a positive integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, along with three positive integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, which represent the lengths of three fence segments. However, as written, the function does not actually evaluate whether these lengths can form a triangle or return any results based on that evaluation. Instead, it prints the values of the arguments passed to it, separated by a specified separator and optionally flushing the output. Therefore, the function currently lacks the logic to determine if the lengths can form a triangle, and it only serves to print input values. **
