You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yura is tasked to build a closed fence in shape of an arbitrary non-degenerate simple quadrilateral. He's already got three straight fence segments with known lengths a, b, and c. Now he needs to find out some possible integer length d of the fourth straight fence segment so that he can build the fence using these four segments. In other words, the fence should have a quadrilateral shape with side lengths equal to a, b, c, and d. Help Yura, find any possible length of the fourth side.

A non-degenerate simple quadrilateral is such a quadrilateral that no three of its corners lie on the same line, and it does not cross itself.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The next t lines describe the test cases.

Each line contains three integers a, b, and c — the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case print a single integer d — the length of the fourth fence segment that is suitable for building the fence. If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Example

Input


2
1 2 3
12 34 56


Output

42

Note

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 1, 2, 3, 4.

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 12, 34, 56, 42.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers representing the lengths of the three fence segments, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a positive integer based on user input, which represents the number of test cases or a specific value provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a positive integer based on user input, which represents a specific value provided by the user. It does not directly handle the number of test cases; it only reads and returns a single integer input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers representing the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input values for t, a, b, and c, where t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a, b, and c are integers representing the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the raw input from the user, which is expected to include a positive integer `t` (indicating the number of test cases), followed by three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the lengths of three fence segments. However, the function does not validate the input or ensure that it meets the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, a, b, and c are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers from the input string split by spaces, which represents the positive integers a, b, and c for each test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers extracted from a single input string, which consists of positive integers a, b, and c split by spaces. There is no validation for input format or handling for cases where fewer or more than three integers are provided.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, a, b, and c are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the string representations of the integers a, b, and c after splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an input string containing integers a, b, and c, splits the string by whitespace, and returns a map object containing the string representations of these integers. The function does not handle cases where the input format is invalid or if fewer than three integers are provided, which could lead to unexpected behavior when used.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a, b, and c are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) representing the lengths of the three fence segments.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list containing the results of func_3() for each of the t test cases, where each test case consists of positive integers a, b, and c representing the lengths of the three fence segments.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of results from `func_3()` for a number of test cases `t`. Each test case uses the lengths of three fence segments represented by positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, since `func_3()` is called without any arguments in `func_5`, it may imply that `func_3()` does not require parameters or handles the parameters internally. The exact details on how `func_3()` processes these test cases and what results it returns are not specified in the provided code. Thus, the exact nature of the results and how they relate to `a`, `b`, and `c` remains unclear without further implementation details of `func_3()`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` initiates a new thread that executes the `main` function. It does not accept any parameters directly, but it is designed to process up to 1000 test cases, each involving integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that can range from 1 to 10^9. The function sets a high recursion limit and stack size to accommodate potentially deep recursive calls within the `main` function. However, without the implementation of the `main` function provided, the specific operations performed on `a`, `b`, and `c` remain undefined within this context.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers a, b, and c representing the lengths of three fence segments, with 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, and the number of tuples is between 1 and 1000.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second tuple (item[1]) from the list 'item', which contains three integers representing the lengths of three fence segments.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the lengths of three fence segments, and it returns the second tuple from the list. If the list has fewer than two tuples, it will raise an IndexError.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9), and the length of l is equal to t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list of tuples 'l' sorted in descending order based on the key defined by the function getKey
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key defined by the function `getKey`. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or where the tuples may contain invalid data types, but it does sort based on the provided key without any additional checks.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a matrix of size n x m filled with the value of num. The variables a, b, and c are positive integers, and the values of n and m must be derived from these variables based on the context, but they are not specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, which define the dimensions of a matrix, and a third parameter `num` that fills the matrix. It returns a matrix of size `n` x `m`, where each element is set to the value of `num`. There are no edge cases or missing functionality since the function strictly adheres to the parameters provided.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9), and the number of test cases is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns the list of tuples x and the result of the expression 'not x & x - 1', where x is a list of tuples containing three integers each (a, b, c) and 't' is the number of test cases. The expression evaluates to a boolean value based on the truthiness of 'x' and the bitwise operations on the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers, and returns a boolean value indicating whether `x` is truthy and if `x` is a power of two (by evaluating the expression `not x & x - 1`). The function does not return the list of tuples, only the boolean result. The boolean expression evaluates to True if `x` is not empty and a power of two; otherwise, it returns False.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, three integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) are provided representing the lengths of the three fence segments.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of the positive integer n, excluding the '0b' prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. It does not handle negative integers or zero, as it assumes `n` is always a positive integer.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and for each test case, the function receives three integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) representing the lengths of the three fence segments.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers representing the digits of the positive integer n, which indicates the number of test cases (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of test cases (with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and returns a list of integers that represent the digits of the integer `n`. The function does not process any additional inputs such as the lengths of three fence segments (a, b, c) as mentioned in the annotations; it only converts the input integer `n` into its constituent digits.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and r is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
    #The program returns the result of the combinatorial expression based on the value of n and the tuple r, which includes three integers a, b, and c, representing the number of test cases and parameters for the calculation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `r`, where each tuple contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates and returns the result of a combinatorial expression based on `n` and the value of `r`, specifically using the factorial function. However, the code does not utilize the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the tuples in `r`, which means their intended purpose or contribution to the calculation is not implemented, possibly leading to incomplete functionality. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `r` is empty or does not match the expected structure.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, c) representing the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns the integer result of dividing the number of test cases `x` by the list `y` of tuples containing the lengths of the three fence segments.
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer value of x divided by the length of list y plus 1, where x represents the number of test cases and y is a list of tuples containing three integers each.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` containing tuples, each with three integers. It calculates and returns the result of dividing `x` by the number of tuples in `y`, returning an integer value. If `x` is not perfectly divisible by the length of `y`, it adds 1 to the result. However, the function will raise a `TypeError` if `y` is empty, as division by zero would occur in that case.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, y is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c) where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is updated according to the number of times the least significant bit of `y` was 1, and `x` is the last value updated to `x * x % p` before the loop terminated.
    return res
    #The program returns the value of 'res', which is updated according to the number of times the least significant bit of 'y' was 1, with 'y' being 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x`, a positive integer `y`, and a positive integer `p`. It computes `res` as `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p` using an efficient exponentiation technique. The function returns the final value of `res`. It does not utilize the tuple input and does not have any checks for edge cases related to the values of `x`, `y`, or `p`, such as `p` being zero.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and y is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (a, b, c) representing the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the initial values from `y`, `y` is 0 (as the loop will eventually terminate when `y` becomes 0).
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the initial values from `y`, which is `x`, as `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and a list of tuples `y`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the lengths of fence segments. It calculates the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the integers in the tuples in `y`. However, it does not actually utilize the values from `y` within the logic; instead, it just computes the GCD using the initial value of `x` and an empty or non-empty `y`. The return value will be `x` if `y` is empty or `0` if `y` is not empty and contains valid tuples. The function does not handle cases for invalid inputs or check if `y` has the correct structure, so it may produce unexpected results if `y` is not formatted as expected.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, followed by n lines each containing three positive integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) representing the lengths of the three fence segments.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases greater than 1, followed by `n` lines each containing three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9) representing the lengths of the three fence segments.
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions for the test cases with three positive integers representing lengths of fence segments are met.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases greater than 1, followed by `n` lines each containing three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9). `n` is greater than 3.
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and greater than 3 representing the number of test cases, followed by `n` lines each containing three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9). `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 289, `i` is 59
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is not a prime number. It returns True if `n` is greater than 3 and is a prime number. The function does not process any lengths of fence segments (a, b, c) as described in the annotations, which is a missing functionality.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to read input from a file named 'input.txt' and write output to a file named 'output.txt'. However, it lacks any logic to process or return values based on the test cases involving integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the function only sets up the input and output redirection without performing any calculations or returning any results.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, a, b, and c are positive integers representing the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        a, b, c = func_3()
        
        func_20(c + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); `a`, `b`, `c` are the values returned by `func_3()` for the last iteration of the loop, and `func_20(c + 1)` has been called for each iteration with the corresponding `c` value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it retrieves three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calls another function, `func_20`, with the value `c + 1` for each test case. However, the function does not check whether a triangle can be formed with the lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`, nor does it return "YES" or "NO" based on that condition as suggested in the annotations. Therefore, the functionality does not include the triangle validation logic and lacks any return value.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, a, b, and c are positive integers representing the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
def func_20():

    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `file` has written the string representation of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep` if there are multiple elements.

        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t`, `a`, `b`, `c` are positive integers; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or a space; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; the 'end' key is removed from `kwargs`, and `file` has written the value associated with 'end' or a newline character. If the flush option in kwargs is set to True, the contents of `file` have been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` accepts a positive integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, along with three positive integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, which represent the lengths of three fence segments. However, as written, the function does not actually evaluate whether these lengths can form a triangle or return any results based on that evaluation. Instead, it prints the values of the arguments passed to it, separated by a specified separator and optionally flushing the output. Therefore, the function currently lacks the logic to determine if the lengths can form a triangle, and it only serves to print input values.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
