The function accepts a positive integer `x`, a positive integer `y`, and a positive integer `p`. It computes `res` as `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p` using an efficient exponentiation technique. The function returns the final value of `res`. It does not utilize the tuple input and does not have any checks for edge cases related to the values of `x`, `y`, or `p`, such as `p` being zero.
