The function accepts no parameters and returns the raw input from the user, which is expected to include a positive integer `t` (indicating the number of test cases), followed by three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the lengths of three fence segments. However, the function does not validate the input or ensure that it meets the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).
