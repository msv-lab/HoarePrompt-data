The function `func_6` initiates a new thread that executes the `main` function. It does not accept any parameters directly, but it is designed to process up to 1000 test cases, each involving integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that can range from 1 to 10^9. The function sets a high recursion limit and stack size to accommodate potentially deep recursive calls within the `main` function. However, without the implementation of the `main` function provided, the specific operations performed on `a`, `b`, and `c` remain undefined within this context.
