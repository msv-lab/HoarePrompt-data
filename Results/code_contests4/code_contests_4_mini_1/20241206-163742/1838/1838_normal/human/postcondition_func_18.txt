The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it retrieves three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calls another function, `func_20`, with the value `c + 1` for each test case. However, the function does not check whether a triangle can be formed with the lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`, nor does it return "YES" or "NO" based on that condition as suggested in the annotations. Therefore, the functionality does not include the triangle validation logic and lacks any return value.
