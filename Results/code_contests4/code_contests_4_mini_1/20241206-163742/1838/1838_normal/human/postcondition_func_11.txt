The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of test cases (with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and returns a list of integers that represent the digits of the integer `n`. The function does not process any additional inputs such as the lengths of three fence segments (a, b, c) as mentioned in the annotations; it only converts the input integer `n` into its constituent digits.
