The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to read input from a file named 'input.txt' and write output to a file named 'output.txt'. However, it lacks any logic to process or return values based on the test cases involving integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the function only sets up the input and output redirection without performing any calculations or returning any results.
