The function accepts a list of tuples `l`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a key defined by the function `getKey`. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or where the tuples may contain invalid data types, but it does sort based on the provided key without any additional checks.
