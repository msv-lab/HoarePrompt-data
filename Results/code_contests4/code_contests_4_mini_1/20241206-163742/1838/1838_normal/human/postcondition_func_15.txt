The function accepts an integer `x` and a list of tuples `y`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the lengths of fence segments. It calculates the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the integers in the tuples in `y`. However, it does not actually utilize the values from `y` within the logic; instead, it just computes the GCD using the initial value of `x` and an empty or non-empty `y`. The return value will be `x` if `y` is empty or `0` if `y` is not empty and contains valid tuples. The function does not handle cases for invalid inputs or check if `y` has the correct structure, so it may produce unexpected results if `y` is not formatted as expected.
