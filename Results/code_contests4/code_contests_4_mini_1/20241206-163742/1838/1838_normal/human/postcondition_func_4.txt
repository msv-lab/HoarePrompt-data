The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of results from `func_3()` for a number of test cases `t`. Each test case uses the lengths of three fence segments represented by positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, since `func_3()` is called without any arguments in `func_5`, it may imply that `func_3()` does not require parameters or handles the parameters internally. The exact details on how `func_3()` processes these test cases and what results it returns are not specified in the provided code. Thus, the exact nature of the results and how they relate to `a`, `b`, and `c` remains unclear without further implementation details of `func_3()`.
