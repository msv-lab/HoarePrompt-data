The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `r`, where each tuple contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates and returns the result of a combinatorial expression based on `n` and the value of `r`, specifically using the factorial function. However, the code does not utilize the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the tuples in `r`, which means their intended purpose or contribution to the calculation is not implemented, possibly leading to incomplete functionality. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `r` is empty or does not match the expected structure.
