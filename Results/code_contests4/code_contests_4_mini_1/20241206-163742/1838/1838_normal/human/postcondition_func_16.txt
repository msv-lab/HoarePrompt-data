The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is not a prime number. It returns True if `n` is greater than 3 and is a prime number. The function does not process any lengths of fence segments (a, b, c) as described in the annotations, which is a missing functionality.
