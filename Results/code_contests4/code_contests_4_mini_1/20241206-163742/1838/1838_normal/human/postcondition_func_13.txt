The function accepts an integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` containing tuples, each with three integers. It calculates and returns the result of dividing `x` by the number of tuples in `y`, returning an integer value. If `x` is not perfectly divisible by the length of `y`, it adds 1 to the result. However, the function will raise a `TypeError` if `y` is empty, as division by zero would occur in that case.
