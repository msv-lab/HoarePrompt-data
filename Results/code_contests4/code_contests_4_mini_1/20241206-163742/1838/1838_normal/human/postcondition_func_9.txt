The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers, and returns a boolean value indicating whether `x` is truthy and if `x` is a power of two (by evaluating the expression `not x & x - 1`). The function does not return the list of tuples, only the boolean result. The boolean expression evaluates to True if `x` is not empty and a power of two; otherwise, it returns False.
