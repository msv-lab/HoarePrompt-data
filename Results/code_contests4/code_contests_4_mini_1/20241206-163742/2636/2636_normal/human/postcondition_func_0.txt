The function processes input lines representing three integers (C1, C2, and C3), with C1 and C2 being between 1 and 10, and C3 also being between 1 and 10. It checks if the sum of C1 and C2 is less than or equal to 20. For each line of input, it calculates how many integers from 1 to 10 can be added to the sum of C1 and C2 without exceeding 20. If more than 3 such integers exist, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values but directly prints the result based on the calculations.
