To determine the output state, we first analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the variables in the initial state.

1. The code checks the value of `e` and prints 'YES' if `e > 3`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
2. The initial state indicates that `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are between 1 and 10, and `c1c2` is the sum of `C1` and `C2`.
3. Since `c1c2` will also be between 2 (when both are 1) and 20 (when both are 10), we need to evaluate the sum of the values of `int(i + c1c2 <= 20)` for each `i` in `cards` to determine `e`.
4. Depending on the specific values of `C1`, `C2`, and the contents of `cards`, `e` could be calculated through the aforementioned condition.

However, without knowing the specific values or the content of `cards`, we cannot definitively determine whether `e` is greater than 3 or not.

Thus, the possible states based on the analysis would be:
- `e` could be greater than 3, leading to the output 'YES'.
- `e` could be less than or equal to 3, leading to the output 'NO'.

Since we cannot ascertain the exact value of `e`, the output state remains ambiguous.

Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10; `c1c2` is the sum of `C1` and `C2`; `e` is calculated based on `cards`; output is either 'YES' if `e > 3` or 'NO' if `e <= 3`.**
