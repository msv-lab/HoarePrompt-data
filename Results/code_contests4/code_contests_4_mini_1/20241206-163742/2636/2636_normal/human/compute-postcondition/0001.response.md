The value of `c` is assigned a list containing integers converted from the values in `line`, which is expected to have at least one line of input. The values of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are not directly affected, but the list `c` will contain values derived from the input. Since `C1` and `C2` must sum to less than or equal to 20, the contents of `c` may depend on those conditions, but without actual input values, we cannot determine the specific values in `c`. Therefore, the output state is: `C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10, and `c` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10, and `c` is a list of integers from input.**
