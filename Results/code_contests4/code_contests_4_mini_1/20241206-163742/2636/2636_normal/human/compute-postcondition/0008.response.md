The variable `cards` is assigned a list of integers from 1 to 10 that are not present in the list `c`. The values of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are not directly changed, but they affect the contents of `c`. Therefore, the output state depends on the specific values of `c` derived from the input line.

Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10; `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding the values in `c`.**
