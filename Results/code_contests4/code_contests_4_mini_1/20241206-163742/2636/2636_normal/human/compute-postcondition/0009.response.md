The variable `c1c2` is assigned the value of `c[0] + c[1]`. Since `C1` and `C2` are between 1 and 10, `c[0]` corresponds to `C1` and `c[1]` corresponds to `C2`. Therefore, `c1c2` will be the sum of the values of `C1` and `C2`, which can range from 2 (if both are 1) to 20 (if both are 10). The values of `C3` and `cards` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10; `c1c2` is the sum of `C1` and `C2`, ranging from 2 to 20; `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding the values in `c`.**
