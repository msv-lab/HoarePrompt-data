The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it utilizes three integers, C1, C2, and C3, which represent the numbers on the cards. The constraints specify that 1 <= C1, C2 <= 10 and 1 <= C3 <= 10, and the total of C1 and C2 must be less than or equal to 20 for the game to be valid. Based on this information, the functionality of the function is to work with these integers and presumably return a result or perform an operation based on the validity of the game. However, without specific output details provided, we cannot determine the exact return values.

Functionality: **The function utilizes three integers C1, C2, and C3, where 1 <= C1, C2 <= 10 and 1 <= C3 <= 10, and the total of C1 and C2 must be less than or equal to 20 for the game to be valid.**
