The code assigns the value of `c` by reading a line from standard input, splitting it into separate components, and converting each component into an integer. Since `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are each between 1 and 10, the line could contain these or other integers within this range, depending on the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the fact that `c` is a list of integers derived from the input line.

Output State: **`C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10; `c` is a list of integers derived from the input line.**
