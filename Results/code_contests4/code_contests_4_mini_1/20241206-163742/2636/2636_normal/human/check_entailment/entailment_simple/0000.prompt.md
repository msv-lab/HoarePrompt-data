You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is one card each with the numbers from "1" to "10", for a total of 10 cards. This card has numbers on the front and nothing on the back. Using this card, you and your opponent will play the game according to the following rules.

1. You and your opponent are dealt a total of two cards, one face up and one back up. You can see the numbers on the front card of your opponent, but not the numbers on the back card.
2. You win when the total number of cards dealt is 20 or less and greater than the total number of your opponent. For example, if your card is "7" "8" (15 total) and your opponent's card is "9" "10" (19 total), your opponent wins.
3. You and your opponent can draw up to one more card. You don't have to pull it.



Now, as a guide to deciding whether to draw one more card, consider the probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw a card, and if that probability is 50% or more, draw a card. When calculating this probability, you can use the information of your two cards and the card on the opponent's table for a total of three cards. In other words, you don't draw those cards because you only have one for each card.

A program that reads your two cards and your opponent's front card, and outputs YES if there is a 50% or greater probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw one more card, otherwise it will output NO. Please create.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Given that the number on your first card is C1, the number on your second card is C2, and the number on your opponent's face card is C3, each dataset is given in the following format: ..


C1 C2 C3


Output

Print YES or NO on one line for each dataset.

Example

Input

1 2 3
5 6 9
8 9 10


Output

YES
YES
NO
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, where 1 <= C1, C2 <= 10 and 1 <= C3 <= 10. The total of C1 and C2 must be less than or equal to 20 for the game to be valid.
def func():
    for line in stdin:
        c = [int(s) for s in line.split()]
        
        cards = [i for i in range(1, 11) if i not in c]
        
        c1c2 = c[0] + c[1]
        
        e = sum(int(i + c1c2 <= 20) for i in cards)
        
        print('YES' if e > 3 else 'NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `C1` is between 1 and 10, `C2` is between 1 and 10, `C3` is between 1 and 10; `c1c2` is the sum of `C1` and `C2`; `e` is the count of integers in the range 1 to 10 that, when added to `c1c2`, do not exceed 20; output is 'YES' if `e` > 3, otherwise 'NO'.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
