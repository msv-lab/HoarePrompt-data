The function reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of trees, and then reads `n` pairs of integers (`xi`, `hi`) which represent the position and height of each tree, respectively. It calculates the number of trees that can be seen based on their positions and heights. The function returns the count of visible trees, which is printed as output. If `n` is 1, it immediately counts one visible tree. For multiple trees, it checks their positions and heights to determine visibility based on specified conditions, ensuring that the calculations account for overlapping heights and positions.
