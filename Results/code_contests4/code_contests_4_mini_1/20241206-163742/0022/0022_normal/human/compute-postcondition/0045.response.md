The value of `cont` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cont` is unknown, but it is not affected by the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `cont` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `cont` is increased by 1.**
