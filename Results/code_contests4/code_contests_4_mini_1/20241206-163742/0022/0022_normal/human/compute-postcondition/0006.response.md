The value of `e` is a map object containing integers from user input split by spaces. Since `e[1]` refers to the second element of the split integers, `h.append(e[1])` appends this value to the list `h`. The initial state indicates that `h` is an empty list, so after appending, `h` will contain the value of `e[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `i` is 0; `p` is a list containing the first integer from user input; `h` contains the value e[1]; `e` is a map object containing integers from user input split by spaces.**
