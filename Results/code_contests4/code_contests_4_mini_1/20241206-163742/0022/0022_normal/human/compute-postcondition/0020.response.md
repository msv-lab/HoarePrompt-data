The variable `cont` is assigned the value 2. The initial states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `pivout`, `p`, `h`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `pivout` is the first element of list `p`; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `cont` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `i` is equal to `n`; `pivout` is the first element of list `p`; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `h` is a list of `n` integers; `cont` is 2.**
