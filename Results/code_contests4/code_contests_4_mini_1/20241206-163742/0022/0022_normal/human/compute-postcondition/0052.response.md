The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on a set of constraints where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of trees. Each tree is represented by a pair of integers (xi, hi), where 1 ≤ xi, hi ≤ 10^9. The pairs (xi, hi) are given in the order of ascending xi, and no two trees have the same coordinate value xi. 

The function's output is based on the processing of these trees, which likely involves determining their status or characteristics based on their given positions and heights. However, the exact nature of the output is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of trees represented by pairs of integers (xi, hi) based on the constraints provided, but does not accept parameters directly. The specific output or result of this processing is not detailed.**
