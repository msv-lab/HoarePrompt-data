The variable `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i] + h[i]`. The value of `i` is 3, so this means we are accessing the 4th element of both lists `p` and `h`. The specific values of `p[i]` and `h[i]` are not given, but they will be used in the calculation for `pivout`. The values of `n` and `cont` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `cont` is increased by 1, and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[3] + h[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `cont` is increased by 1, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[3] + h[3]**
