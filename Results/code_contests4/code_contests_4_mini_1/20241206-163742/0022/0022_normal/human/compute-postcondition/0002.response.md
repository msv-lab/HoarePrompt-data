The variable `h` is assigned an empty list. The values of `n` and `p` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `p` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `p` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list**.
