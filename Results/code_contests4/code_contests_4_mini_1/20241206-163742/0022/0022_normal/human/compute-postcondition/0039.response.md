`pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `pivout` takes the value at the third position of the list `p`, which is defined as having at least 3 elements. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `pivout` is `p[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `pivout` is `p[2]**
