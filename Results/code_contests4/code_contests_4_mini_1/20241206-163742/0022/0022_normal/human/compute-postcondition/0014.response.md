The variable `h` is updated by appending the value of `e[1]` to it. The initial state indicates that `h` contains the value of `e[1]`, and since we are appending `e[1]`, `h` will now contain two instances of `e[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `i` is 2, `p` is a list containing the first integer from user input followed by `e[0]`, `h` now contains two instances of `e[1]`**.
