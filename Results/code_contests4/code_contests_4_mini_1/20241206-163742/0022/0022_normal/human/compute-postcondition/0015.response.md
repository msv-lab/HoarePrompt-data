To analyze the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to consider the final condition after the loop runs n times.

1. The variable `n` remains unchanged; it is equal to the user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
2. The loop iterates `n` times, so the index variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes.
3. The list `p` will contain `n` elements, which are the first integers from each user input split by spaces, resulting in `p` being a list of integers with a length of `n`.
4. The list `h` will also contain `n` elements, which are the second integers from each user input split by spaces, resulting in `h` being a list of integers with a length of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `i` is `n`; `p` is a list of `n` integers from the first element of each user input; `h` is a list of `n` integers from the second element of each user input.**
