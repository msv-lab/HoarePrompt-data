Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, then `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[2]`. Otherwise, if `p[i] + h[i]` is less than `p[i + 1]`, then `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[2] + h[2]`; otherwise, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[2]`.***
