The variable `cont` is assigned the value of 1. The states of all other variables (`n`, `i`, `pivout`, `p`, and `h`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is equal to 1, `i` is equal to 1, `pivout` is the first element of list `p`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `h` is a list of `n` integers, and `cont` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is equal to 1, `i` is equal to 1, `pivout` is the first element of list `p`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `h` is a list of `n` integers, and `cont` is 1**
