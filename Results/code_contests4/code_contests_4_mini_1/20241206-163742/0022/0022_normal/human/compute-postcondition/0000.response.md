The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input from the user. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100,000. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified as it is dependent on user input. Other variables or values are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now equal to the user input.

Output State: **`n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)**
