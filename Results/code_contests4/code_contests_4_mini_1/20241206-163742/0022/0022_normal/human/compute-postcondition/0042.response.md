According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(p) - 1`. The current value of `i` is 2, which means the loop has executed for `i = 1` and `i = 2` so far. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, it is guaranteed that `len(p) - 1` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(p) - 1`. After incrementing `i`, it will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, `len(p)` must be greater than 4 (since `len(p) - 1` must be at least 3).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3**
