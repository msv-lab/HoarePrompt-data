Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `i` is 3. If `p[3] - h[3]` is greater than `pivout`, `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is set to `p[3]`. Otherwise, if `p[3] + h[3]` is less than `p[4]`, `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[3] + h[3]`. If neither condition holds, `pivout` is assigned the value of the fourth element of the list `p`.***
