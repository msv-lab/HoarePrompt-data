The statement `pivout = p[i] + h[i]` assigns the value of `p[i] + h[i]` to `pivout`. The previous value of `cont` is not changed by this statement, and the values of `p[i]` and `h[i]` are not specified. Therefore, the output state depends on the values of `p[i]` and `h[i]`. 

Since `cont` is not affected by this operation, and without specific values for `p[i]` and `h[i]`, we can only state that `pivout` is dependent on `p[i]` and `h[i]`. 

Output State: **`cont` is increased by 1; `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i] + h[i]`**
