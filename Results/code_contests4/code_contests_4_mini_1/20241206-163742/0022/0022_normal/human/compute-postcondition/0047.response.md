`pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is 3. Since `p` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p[3]` is a valid index and `pivout` will hold the value of the fourth element of the list `p`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `pivout` is the fourth element of the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `pivout` is the fourth element of the list `p`**.
