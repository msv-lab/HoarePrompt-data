Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `(p[i] - h[i] <= pivout)` is true. If `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, then `cont` is increased by 1 and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i] + h[i]`. Otherwise, `pivout` remains equal to `p[1]`, while the conditions regarding `n`, `len(p)`, `i`, and `(p[i] - h[i] <= pivout)` continue to hold true, with `(p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1])` being false.***
