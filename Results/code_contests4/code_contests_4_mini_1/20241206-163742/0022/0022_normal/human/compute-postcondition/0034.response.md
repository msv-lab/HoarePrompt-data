According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `len(p) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(p) - 1`, which means that `len(p)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to run again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions indicate that `len(p)` is greater than 1, so for the loop to execute a second time, `len(p)` must be at least 3 (to satisfy `len(p) - 1 > 1`). Therefore, `i` will be 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
