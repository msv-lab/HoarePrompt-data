The variable `p` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is equal to user input (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `p` is an empty list**
