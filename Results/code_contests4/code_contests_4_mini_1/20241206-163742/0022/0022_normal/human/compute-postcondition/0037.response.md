The value of `cont` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cont` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `len(p)`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `cont` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `cont` is increased by 1.**
