`pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is 3. Since `p` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p[3]` will successfully retrieve the fourth element of the list. The values of the other variables `n` and `cont` are not affected, so the output state will include the value of `pivout` derived from `p[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `cont` is increased by 1, `pivout` is `p[3]`.**
