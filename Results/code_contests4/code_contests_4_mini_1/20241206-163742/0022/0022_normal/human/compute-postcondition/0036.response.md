The variable `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, where `i` is 2. The list `p` has at least 3 elements, thus `p[2]` is a valid index. The values of `n` and `cont` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cont` is increased by 1, and `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `len(p)` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `cont` is increased by 1, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[2]**
