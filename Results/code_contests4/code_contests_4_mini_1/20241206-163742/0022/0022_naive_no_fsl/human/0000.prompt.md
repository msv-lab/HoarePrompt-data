You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Susie listens to fairy tales before bed every day. Today's fairy tale was about wood cutters and the little girl immediately started imagining the choppers cutting wood. She imagined the situation that is described below.

There are n trees located along the road at points with coordinates x1, x2, ..., xn. Each tree has its height hi. Woodcutters can cut down a tree and fell it to the left or to the right. After that it occupies one of the segments [xi - hi, xi] or [xi;xi + hi]. The tree that is not cut down occupies a single point with coordinate xi. Woodcutters can fell a tree if the segment to be occupied by the fallen tree doesn't contain any occupied point. The woodcutters want to process as many trees as possible, so Susie wonders, what is the maximum number of trees to fell. 

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of trees.

Next n lines contain pairs of integers xi, hi (1 ≤ xi, hi ≤ 109) — the coordinate and the height of the і-th tree.

The pairs are given in the order of ascending xi. No two trees are located at the point with the same coordinate.

Output

Print a single number — the maximum number of trees that you can cut down by the given rules.

Input

5 10
10 9
20 1


Output

4

Note

In the first sample you can fell the trees like that: 

  * fell the 1-st tree to the left — now it occupies segment [ - 1;1]
  * fell the 2-nd tree to the right — now it occupies segment [2;3]
  * leave the 3-rd tree — it occupies point 5
  * leave the 4-th tree — it occupies point 10
  * fell the 5-th tree to the right — now it occupies segment [19;20]



In the second sample you can also fell 4-th tree to the right, after that it will occupy segment [10;19].
Program:
```
n = input()
p = []
h = []
for i in range(n):
    e = map(int, raw_input().split())
    p.append(e[0])
    h.append(e[1])
pivout = p[0]
if n == 1:
    cont = 1
else:
    cont = 2
for i in range(1, len(p) - 1):
    if p[i] - h[i] > pivout:
        cont += 1
        pivout = p[i]
    elif p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]:
        cont += 1
        pivout = p[i] + h[i]
    else:
        pivout = p[i]
print(cont)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
