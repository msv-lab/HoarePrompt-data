To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and check if it correctly computes the maximum number of trees that can be felled according to the specified rules.

The main points from the problem description are:
1. Each tree can be felled to the left or to the right.
2. A tree can be felled if it does not occupy the same space as another tree or the space occupied by the trees that are not cut down.
3. The trees are given in ascending order based on their coordinates.

### Analyzing the Code:

1. The code reads the number of trees and their respective positions and heights.
2. It initializes a counter (`cont`) to keep track of the number of trees that can be felled.
3. The first tree can always be felled to the left, and thus the initial count is set to `2` if there are at least two trees.
4. It iterates through the trees (except the first and last) to check if the current tree can be felled to the left or right based on the conditions:
   - It checks if the left fall of the current tree does not overlap with the last occupied position (`pivout`).
   - If falling to the left is not possible, it checks if falling to the right is possible without overlapping with the next tree.

### Potential Issues:

- The program does not handle the last tree correctly. The last tree can always be felled to the right if it doesnâ€™t overlap with the last occupied position. This logic is not included in the current implementation.
- The code assumes that if `n == 1`, it will always return `1`, which is correct. However, for multiple trees, it misses the case of the last one.

### Test Case to Validate Incorrectness:

Let's consider the case where there are three trees placed closely:

**Input:**
```
3
1 2
2 1
3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
The maximum number of trees that can be felled is `3`, because:
- The first tree can be felled to the left (occupying [-1, 1]).
- The second tree can be left standing (occupying [2]).
- The third tree can be felled to the right (occupying [3, 5]).

**Output of the Program:**
With the given code, the program will incorrectly output `2`, as it does not consider the potential of the last tree being felled to the right.

### Conclusion:

Since the code does not handle the last tree correctly and can lead to an incorrect count of the maximum number of trees that can be felled, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
