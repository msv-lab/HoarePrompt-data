#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple test cases, where T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000). For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of monsters (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000). Each monster has two parameters a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^12) representing the health and the damage dealt upon death, respectively. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000.

        for n in range(N):
            cur = map(int, inp[_i].split())
            _i += 1
            monsters.append(cur)
            if n > 0:
                dam = max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])
                mnShots += dam
                start = min(start, cur[0] - dam)
        
        dam = max(0, monsters[0][0] - monsters[-1][1])
        
        mnShots += dam
        
        start = min(start, monsters[0][0] - dam)
        
        res.append(mnShots + start)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` includes the values of `mnShots + start` for each iteration of the outer loop, `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `_i` is incremented by the total number of lines processed in `inp`, `monsters` contains the tuples of monsters for each test case, `mnShots` is the total damage calculated for all monsters, `start` is the minimum value updated based on the monsters' attributes.
    os.write(1, '\n'.join(str(x) for x in res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case contains a number of monsters, and for each monster, it calculates the total damage required to defeat them based on their health and the damage they deal upon death. It returns the calculated damage for each test case as a list of results. The function does not accept any parameters directly and handles inputs via standard input. It also correctly manages edge cases such as the minimum health and damage values for the monsters.
