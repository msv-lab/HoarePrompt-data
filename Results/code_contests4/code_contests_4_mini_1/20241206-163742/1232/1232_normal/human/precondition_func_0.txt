The function processes multiple test cases, where T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000). For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of monsters (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000). Each monster has two parameters a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^12) representing the health and the damage dealt upon death, respectively. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000.
