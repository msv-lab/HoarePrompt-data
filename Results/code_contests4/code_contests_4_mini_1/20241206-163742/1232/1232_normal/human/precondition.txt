T is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 150000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) representing the number of monsters, and for each monster i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), a_i and b_i are positive integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^12) representing the health and explosion damage of the monster, respectively. The total number of monsters across all test cases does not exceed 300000.
