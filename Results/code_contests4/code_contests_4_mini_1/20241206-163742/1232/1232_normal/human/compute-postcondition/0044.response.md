The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_i` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`; `T` must be greater than 1; `t` is 1; `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`; `_i` is increased by 1.
