The value of `mnShots` is increased by `dam`. Since `dam` is either 0 or a positive integer, the new value of `mnShots` can either remain unchanged (if `dam` is 0) or increase by a positive amount (if `dam` is a positive integer). However, since the current value of `mnShots` is not provided, we can't determine its exact new value. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential change based on the value of `dam`.

Output State: **`dam` is either 0 or a positive integer; `mnShots` is increased by `dam`.**
