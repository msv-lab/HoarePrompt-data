According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is such that `N` is greater than `0`, and the loop is set to execute for the next value of `n`. Since `_i` is increased by 1, `n` will be incremented to `n + 1` for the next iteration. For the loop to execute once more, `n` must be less than `N`, which implies that `n + 1` must be less than `N`.

State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `monsters` includes `cur` with `cur` appended to it, `n` is `n + 1`, and `_i` is increased by 1.**
