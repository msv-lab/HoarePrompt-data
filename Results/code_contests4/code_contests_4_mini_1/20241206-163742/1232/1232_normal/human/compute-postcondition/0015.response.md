The code `monsters.append(cur)` adds the value of `cur` (which is a map object from `inp[2]`) to the `monsters` list. The initial state indicates that `monsters` is currently an empty list. After the execution, `monsters` will contain one element, which is the `cur` map object.

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 3, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` contains 1 element (the map object from `inp[2]`), `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[2]`.

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 3, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` contains 1 element (the map object from `inp[2]`), `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[2]`**.
