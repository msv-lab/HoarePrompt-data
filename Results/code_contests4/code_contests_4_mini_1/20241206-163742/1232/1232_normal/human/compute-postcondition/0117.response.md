Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases where each test case contains a number of monsters, and for each monster, it calculates the total damage required to defeat them based on their health and the damage they deal upon death. It returns the calculated damage for each test case as a list of results. The function does not accept any parameters directly and handles inputs via standard input. It also correctly manages edge cases such as the minimum health and damage values for the monsters. **
