Postcondition: ***`res` includes the value of `mnShots + maxint`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` now contains `cur` which is assigned the values from `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, `mnShots` is 0, and if `N` is greater than 0, then `start` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`.***
