The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`. The `inp[_i]` accesses the input at index `_i`, which has been increased by 1, so it will be the next input string after the current one. The `split()` function will split that input string into separate components, and `map(int, ...)` will convert each component into an integer. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and the list `monsters` remains empty, while other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` includes the value of `mnShots + maxint`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is `maxint`, `n` is 0, and `cur` is a map of integers from the split input at index `_i`.
