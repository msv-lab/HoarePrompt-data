The variable `_i` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is an integer value derived from the first element of `inp`, `_i` is 1**
