Postcondition: ***`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `monsters` includes `cur` appended to it, and `n` is `n + 1`. If `n` is greater than 0, `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, and `start` is assigned the value `min(start, cur[0] - dam)`.***
