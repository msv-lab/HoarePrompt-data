According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. If `n` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_i` has been increased by 1, which indicates that the next iteration will refer to the next input line, and `N` is greater than `k + 1`, meaning there are still iterations left. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be equal to the current value of `N` and `N` must be greater than `n + 1`.

State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + maxint`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` now contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2, and `n` is 1**
