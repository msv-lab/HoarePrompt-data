The value `mnShots` is assumed to be defined previously in the code, and `start` has been updated based on the calculation involving `monsters`. The line of code appends the sum of `mnShots` and `start` to the `res` list. The values of `res`, `mnShots`, and `start` are affected by this operation.

Assuming `mnShots` and `start` have specific values, the output state will reflect that `res` now includes the calculated value of `mnShots + start`.

Output State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`**
