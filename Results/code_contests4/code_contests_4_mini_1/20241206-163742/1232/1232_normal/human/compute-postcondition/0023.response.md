The value of `_i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `_i` is 3, so after execution, `_i` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains 1 element, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[3]` converted to integers.
