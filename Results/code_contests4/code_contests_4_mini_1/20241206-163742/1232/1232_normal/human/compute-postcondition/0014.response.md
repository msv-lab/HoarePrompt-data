The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, so if `_i` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`res`, `inp`, `T`, `t`, `N`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `start`, `cur`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 3, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[2]`.

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 3, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[2]`**.
