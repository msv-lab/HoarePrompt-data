`monsters` is updated by appending the value of `cur`, which is a map of integers derived from the split input at index `_i`. Since `monsters` was previously an empty list, after executing the code, it will now contain one element, which is `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` includes the value of `mnShots + maxint`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` now contains `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is `maxint`, `n` is 0, and `_i` has been incremented by 1.
