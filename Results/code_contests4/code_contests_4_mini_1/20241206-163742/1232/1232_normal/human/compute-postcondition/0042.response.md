According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, and `t` is the current loop iteration variable. Since `t` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `t` will be equal to 1 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute a second time, `T` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than 1, and `t` is 1**
