The code `monsters.append(cur)` adds the value of `cur` to the list `monsters`. The previous state indicates that `monsters` currently contains the value of `cur`, which implies that `cur` is already part of the list. After executing the code, `cur` will be appended again to `monsters`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` includes the value of `mnShots + maxint`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `_i` is now the incremented value + 1, `monsters` now contains `cur` twice, `mnShots` is 0, `N` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `n` is 1.

Output State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + maxint`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `_i` is now the incremented value + 1, `monsters` now contains `cur` twice, `mnShots` is 0, `N` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `n` is 1.**
