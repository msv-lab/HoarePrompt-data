According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, and since `t` is implicitly referencing the current iteration count starting from 0, it must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than 1, and `t` will be 1**
