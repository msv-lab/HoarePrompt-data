Postcondition: ***`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 3, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` contains 1 element (the map object from `inp[2]`), `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, and `cur` is a map object from `inp[2]`. If `n` is greater than 0, then `start` is assigned the minimum of `maxint` and `cur[0] - dam`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged.***
