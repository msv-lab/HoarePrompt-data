Postcondition: ***`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` includes `cur`, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, which is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `cur[0]` and `monsters[n - 1][1]`, and `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam` if `n` is greater than 0. Otherwise, if `n` is not greater than 0, there is no change to `mnShots` and `start`.***
