The value of `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. Since `dam` is assigned the value of `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`, the actual value of `mnShots` will be increased by whatever value `dam` holds, which is determined by the expression involving `cur` and `monsters`. The previous state of `mnShots` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `mnShots` due to the addition of `dam`.

Output State: **`mnShots` is increased by `dam`, where `dam` is assigned the value of `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])**
