Output State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `N` is the total number of iterations; `monsters` includes all `cur` values added during the iterations; `mnShots` is the accumulated total of damage calculated during the iterations; `start` is the minimum value calculated after all iterations; `dam` is calculated as max(0, monsters[0][0] - monsters[-1][1]); `mnShots` is updated to `mnShots + dam`.**
