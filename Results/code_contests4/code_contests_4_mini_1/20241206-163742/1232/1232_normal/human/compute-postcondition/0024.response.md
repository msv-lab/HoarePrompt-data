The code `monsters.append(cur)` adds the object `cur` to the list `monsters`. Given that `monsters` initially contains 1 element and `cur` is a map object converted from `inp[3]` to integers, the state of `monsters` will now hold 2 elements: the original element and the new element represented by `cur`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains 2 elements, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[3]` converted to integers.

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains 2 elements, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[3]` converted to integers.**
