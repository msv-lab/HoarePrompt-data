The value of `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`. `mnShots` is then incremented by `dam`. Since the previous value of `mnShots` is not provided, we can only indicate that `mnShots` will increase by the value of `dam`. Therefore, the output state is: `dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]` and `mnShots` is increased by `dam`.

Output State: **`dam` is assigned the value `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]` and `mnShots` is increased by `dam`.**
