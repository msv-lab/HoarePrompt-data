Postcondition: ***`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 5, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains 3 elements, `mnShots` is 0, `dam` remains unchanged, `cur` holds mapped integers from `inp[4]`. If `n` is greater than 0, `start` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, `start` remains unchanged.***
