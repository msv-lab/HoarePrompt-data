The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_i` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, `T` must be greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, and `_i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, `T` must be greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, `_i` is increased by 1.**
