The value of `_i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_i` is 4. Therefore, after execution, `_i` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 5, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains 2 elements, `mnShots` is 0, `dam` remains unchanged, `cur` holds mapped integers from `inp[4]**.
