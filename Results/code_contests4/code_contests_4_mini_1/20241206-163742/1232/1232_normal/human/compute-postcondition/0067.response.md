The value of `_i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `_i` is not specified, but the operation still successfully increases it by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `monsters` includes `cur` with `cur` appended to it, `n` is `n + 1`, `_i` is increased by 1, and `cur` is assigned the values obtained from mapping integers over the split input line at index `_i`.
