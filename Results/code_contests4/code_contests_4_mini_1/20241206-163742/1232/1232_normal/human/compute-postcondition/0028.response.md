Postcondition: ***`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains 2 elements, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `min(start, cur[0] - dam)` but the computation cannot be performed due to an index error; `mnShots` and `dam` remain unchanged. If `n` is greater than 0, an error occurs due to an index out of bounds for the list `monsters`.***
