The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it processes multiple test cases internally. It operates on a positive integer `T` that represents the number of test cases, where for each test case, there is a positive integer `n` indicating the number of monsters. Each monster is characterized by two parameters: `a_i`, representing the health of the monster, and `b_i`, representing the damage dealt upon the monster's death. The constraints ensure that `T` can be between 1 and 150,000, `n` can be between 2 and 300,000, and each `a_i` and `b_i` can range from 1 to 10^12. The total number of monsters across all test cases cannot exceed 300,000.

After executing the function body, the output is a result for each test case based on the monsters' health and damage parameters.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases of monsters and returns results based on the health and damage parameters of each monster without accepting parameters directly.**
