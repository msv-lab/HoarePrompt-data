The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`. Here, `inp[_i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `inp`, which is being split into individual strings and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since `inp` holds lines from stdin and `_i` is 2, the value of `cur` will be a map object containing integers derived from the line at `inp[2]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 2, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, and `cur` is a map object from `inp[2]`.

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 2, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the value of `maxint`, `cur` is a map object from `inp[2]`.**
