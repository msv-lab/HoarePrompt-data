`mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. The value of `dam` is already computed as `max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1])`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, so we only know that `mnShots` increases by `dam`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dam` is computed as max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]); `mnShots` is increased by `dam`.

Output State: **`dam` is computed as max(0, cur[0] - monsters[n - 1][1]); `mnShots` is increased by `dam`.**
