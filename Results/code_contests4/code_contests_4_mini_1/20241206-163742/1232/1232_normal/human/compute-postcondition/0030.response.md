The variable `cur` is assigned the result of `map(int, inp[_i].split())`, where `inp[_i]` is a line from the input, specifically the fifth line (since `_i` is 4). This line is split into components (presumably strings) and then each component is converted to an integer. Since there is no indication of what `inp[_i]` contains, the exact values for `cur` cannot be determined. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `inp` holds a list of lines from stdin, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `t` is 0, `N` is greater than 4, `monsters` contains 2 elements, `mnShots` is 0, `dam` remains unchanged, `cur` holds mapped integers from `inp[_i]`.**
