Postcondition: ***`res` includes the value of `mnShots + start`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, and `monsters` includes `cur` with `cur` appended to it. If `n > 0`, `start` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cur[0] - dam`. `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, and `_i` is increased by 1.***
