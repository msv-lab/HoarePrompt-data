Postcondition: ***`res` includes the value of `mnShots + maxint`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `N` is greater than `k + 1`, `_i` is now the incremented value + 1, `monsters` now contains `cur` twice, `mnShots` is either `dam` or `dam`, `N` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `n` is 1, `dam` is max(0, cur[0] - cur[1]), and `start` is updated to min(start, cur[0] - dam) if `n` is greater than 0.***
