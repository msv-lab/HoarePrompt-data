Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes `lst` as a list of integers and `c` as an integer, but it seems that `c` is treated as a list in the for loop (`for i in c:`). This is incorrect because `c` should represent the count of holds (the length of `lst`) and not an iterable. This will lead to a TypeError when `c` is an integer.

2. **Hold Removal Logic**: The logic for removing a hold is not implemented. The program does not iterate over all possible holds that can be removed (from the second to the second-to-last), which is necessary to evaluate the maximum distance after removing each hold. Instead, it seems to incorrectly check if the first and last indices are included in `c` and only calculates the maximum difference based on the original list.

3. **Difficulty Calculation**: The maximum adjacent difference is calculated but not in the context of removing a hold. The problem requires finding the minimum maximum distance after removing one hold, which is not addressed in the program. The program should evaluate the maximum distances for each possible removal scenario and determine the minimum of those maximum distances.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns the maximum adjacent difference or a large constant value if certain conditions are met, but this does not align with the expected output (minimum difficulty after removal of one hold).

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold according to the problem description. It lacks the necessary steps to evaluate all possible removal scenarios and fails to handle input correctly.
