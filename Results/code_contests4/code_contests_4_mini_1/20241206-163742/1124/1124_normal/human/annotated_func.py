#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, with at least 3 elements, and c is an integer representing the number of holds (equal to the length of lst). The sequence lst must be strictly increasing, and each height must be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
def func_1(lst, c):
    temp = []
    for i in c:
        temp.append(lst[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, `c` is the length of `lst`.
    awk = -1
    if (0 in c and n - 1 in c) :
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            awk = max(awk, temp[i] - temp[i - 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst`, `i` is `c`, and `c` is the number of elements in `lst`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst`, `i` is `c`, and `c` is the number of elements in `lst`, provided that 0 is in `c` and `n - 1` is in `c`. Otherwise, there is no effect on the program state as there is no else part.
    if (awk == -1) :
        return 10000000000
        #The program returns 10000000000
    else :
        return awk
        #The program returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights in the list `lst`, represented by the variable `awk`, which is not equal to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing strictly increasing heights and an integer `c` that is expected to be a range object (not just an integer) representing indices to access elements in `lst`. It returns 10000000000 if both the first and last indices (0 and `n-1`) are not included in `c`, or it returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst` if valid indices are provided. However, if `c` does not properly represent the indices of `lst`, the function may raise an error due to incorrect indexing. Additionally, there is no check on the values in `c` to ensure that they are valid indices for the list `lst`.
