The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing strictly increasing heights and an integer `c` that is expected to be a range object (not just an integer) representing indices to access elements in `lst`. It returns 10000000000 if both the first and last indices (0 and `n-1`) are not included in `c`, or it returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst` if valid indices are provided. However, if `c` does not properly represent the indices of `lst`, the function may raise an error due to incorrect indexing. Additionally, there is no check on the values in `c` to ensure that they are valid indices for the list `lst`.
