According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `c`, which represents the number of holds. Since `i` is currently 1, it implies that the loop has executed once, and the next iteration should occur if `i` is less than `c`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `c` must be greater than 1. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be greater than 2.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, `c` is an integer greater than 2, `temp` contains the first and second elements of `lst`, `i` is 2**
