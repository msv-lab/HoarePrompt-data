To analyze the code snippet, we recognize that `awk` is being assigned the maximum value between its current value and the difference between the current element in `temp` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i - 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, which means `temp` has at least two elements since `i` is 0 and `i - 1` needs to be valid.
- `i` is 0, so `temp[i]` corresponds to the first element of `temp`, and `temp[i - 1]` corresponds to the last element of `temp` (because `i - 1` evaluates to -1).

The calculation will be:
- `temp[i]` is `temp[0]` (the first element).
- `temp[i - 1]` is `temp[-1]` (the last element of the list).

Thus, `awk` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the difference between the first and last elements of `temp`.

The other variables remain unchanged as this code only affects `awk`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation involving `awk`.

Output State: **`temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, `i` is 0, and `awk` is updated to max(awk, temp[0] - temp[-1])**.
