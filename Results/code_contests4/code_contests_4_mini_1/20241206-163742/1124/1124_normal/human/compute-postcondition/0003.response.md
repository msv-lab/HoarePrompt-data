According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `c`, which represents the number of holds. Since `i` is currently 0, it indicates that this is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `c` must be greater than 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, `temp` now contains the first element of `lst`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 1**
