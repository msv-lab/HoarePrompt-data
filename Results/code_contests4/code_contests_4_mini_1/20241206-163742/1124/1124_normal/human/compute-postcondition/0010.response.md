According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `temp`, which is a list containing all elements of `lst`. The `len(temp)` will provide the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `temp` must contain at least one element. Given that `c` is the length of `lst`, it implies that `c` is also at least 1 if `temp` is not empty. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 in the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `temp` contains at least one element, and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, for the loop to execute the first time `temp` is not empty, `i` is 0**
