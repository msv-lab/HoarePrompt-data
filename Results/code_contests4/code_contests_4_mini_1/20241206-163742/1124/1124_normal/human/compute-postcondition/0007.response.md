The loop iterates over the range of `c`, which represents the number of holds, and appends each corresponding height from `lst` to the `temp` list. If `c` is equal to the length of `lst`, after all iterations of the loop, `temp` will contain all elements of `lst`.

If `c` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `c` times, appending each element from `lst` to `temp`. If `c` equals 0, the loop does not execute, and `temp` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, `c` is the length of `lst`.**
