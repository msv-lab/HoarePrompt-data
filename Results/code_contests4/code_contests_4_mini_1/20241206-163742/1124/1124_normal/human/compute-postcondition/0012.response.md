According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `temp`. The loop is set to iterate over the range of the length of `temp`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(temp)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, the length of `temp` must be greater than 1 since the current value of `i` is 0, indicating that `temp` has at least 1 element.

State: **`temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(temp)` must be greater than 1**
