Postcondition: ***`temp` is a list containing all elements of `lst`, `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst`, `i` is `c`, and `c` is the number of elements in `lst`, provided that 0 is in `c` and `n - 1` is in `c`. Otherwise, there is no effect on the program state as there is no else part.***
