The value of `temp` changes as `temp.append(lst[i])` appends the first element of `lst` (since `i` is 0) to `temp`. The initial state indicates that `c` is greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute for the first time, and `i` is 0, so `lst[i]` refers to the first element of `lst`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, `temp` now contains the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, `temp` now contains the first element of `lst`, `i` is 0**
