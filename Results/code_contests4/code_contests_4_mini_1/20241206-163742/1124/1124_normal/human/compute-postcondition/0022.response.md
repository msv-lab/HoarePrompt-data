The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `c`. The parameter `lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, which must be strictly increasing and contain at least 3 elements, with each height between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The parameter `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, which is equal to the length of `lst`. 

After executing the function body, if certain conditions are met, it returns either a specific value or computes a difference. Specifically, if the conditions for Case_1 are fulfilled, the function returns 10000000000. If the conditions for Case_2 are fulfilled, the function returns the maximum difference between consecutive heights in the list `lst`, represented by the variable `awk`, which is not equal to -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of strictly increasing integers representing heights and a count of those heights, returning either a constant value or the maximum difference between consecutive heights based on the defined cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` representing strictly increasing heights and an integer `c` representing the number of holds. It returns 10000000000 under certain conditions or the maximum difference between consecutive heights in `lst` if that difference is not equal to -1.**
