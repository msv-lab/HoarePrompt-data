According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over `c`, which is an integer representing the number of holds. However, in Python, the `for` loop expects an iterable, and using `for i in c` will not work correctly since `c` is not an iterable but an integer. 

To resolve this, `c` should be adjusted to be in a range to create an iterable, for instance, `range(c)`. This way, the loop can execute from 0 to `c-1`. 

Additionally, the variable `i` will need to start at 0, which is the first index of the range.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing the heights of the holds, `c` is an integer representing the number of holds, `temp` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `c` should be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
