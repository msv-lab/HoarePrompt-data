To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description. 

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have `n` holds with increasing heights.
2. We need to remove one hold (not the first or the last) and find the minimum maximum difference between adjacent holds after the removal.
3. The output should be a single number representing this minimum difficulty.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(lst, c)` that:
- Takes a list of heights and a combination of indices to remove.
- Computes the maximum difference between adjacent holds from the selected combination.
- Returns this maximum difference.

The main part of the program generates all combinations of indices to remove (excluding the first and last holds) and finds the minimum of the maximum differences obtained from these combinations.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Inputs**: 
   - The variable `n` is being used inside the function `func_1` without being passed as an argument, leading to a potential scope issue.
   - The `lst` passed to `func_1` is a `map` object, which won't behave as intended when indexing. It should be converted to a list first.

2. **Logic for Valid Combinations**:
   - The program does not check if the combination `c` includes the first and last elements before calculating the maximum difference. This goes against the problem requirement that the first and last holds must remain.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 3`, the only valid hold to remove is the middle one. The program should handle such trivial cases correctly.

4. **Unverified Output**:
   - The program does not verify that the selected combination always has the first and last elements, which can lead to incorrect calculations.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
3
1 5 10
```
The only possible removal is the second hold (height = 5). The expected maximum difference should be `10 - 1 = 9`, but due to the issues mentioned, the program could lead to unintended consequences or errors.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and potential pitfalls in the logic, the program does not correctly handle the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
