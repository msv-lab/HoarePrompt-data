To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it correctly calculates the minimum difficulty after removing one of the holds.

Here is the provided program:

```python
def func_1(lst, c):
    temp = []
    for i in c:
        temp.append(lst[i])
    awk = -1
    if 0 in c and n - 1 in c:
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            awk = max(awk, temp[i] - temp[i - 1])
    if awk == -1:
        return 10000000000
    else:
        return awk

n = int(input())
lst = map(int, raw_input().split())
k = 1
awk = 10000000000
comb = list(itertools.combinations(range(n), n - k))
for c in comb:
    awk = min(awk, func_1(lst, c))
print(awk)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer `n` and a list of heights. However, it uses `raw_input()` which is incorrect for Python 3. It should be replaced with `input()`.

2. **Combination Generation**: The program generates combinations of indices for removing one hold. It uses `itertools.combinations` but does not import the `itertools` module, which will cause a `NameError`.

3. **Difficulty Calculation**: The function `func_1` attempts to determine the maximum difference between adjacent holds after removing one hold. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed:
   - It checks if the first and last indices are in `c`, but it does not handle cases where the hold to be removed is not between the first and last holds.
   - It does not correctly calculate the maximum distance for all valid combinations of removals.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where removing any hold would lead to an invalid configuration, particularly if the remaining holds do not include both the first and last.

### Test Case Failure:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- The correct output is `2`, which is the maximum difference after any hold is removed.
- If we remove hold at index 2 (height 3), the heights left are `[1, 2, 4, 5]` which results in maximum difference `3 - 2 = 1`, and `4 - 2 = 2`. However, the program's logic may not correctly compute this due to the flawed checks in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the program, particularly with the calculation of `awk` and the handling of edge cases, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
