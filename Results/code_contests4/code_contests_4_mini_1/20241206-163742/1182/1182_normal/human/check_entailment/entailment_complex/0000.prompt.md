You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke can change a string t of length N into a string t' of length N - 1 under the following rule:

* For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1), the i-th character of t' must be either the i-th or (i + 1)-th character of t.



There is a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Snuke's objective is to apply the above operation to s repeatedly so that all the characters in s are the same. Find the minimum necessary number of operations.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    b = []
    for k in range(len(a)):
        b.append(a[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100; `a` is a non-empty string from raw_input(); `b` contains all characters of `a`; `k` is equal to the length of `a`.
    b = np.array(b)
    alp = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    al = []
    for k in range(len(alp)):
        al.append(alp[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100; `a` is a non-empty string from raw_input(); `b` is now a numpy array containing all characters of `a`; `k` is 26; `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `al` is now ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'].
    res = []
    for aa in al:
        if aa in b:
            res.append(np.where(b == aa))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `k` is 26, `alp` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `al` is now ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], and `res` contains the indices of all characters in `al` that are present in `b`.
    m = []
    for k in range(len(res)):
        zz = np.hstack([np.array([0]), res[k][0], np.array([len(a)])])
        
        z = np.diff(zz)
        
        if len(z) > 0:
            m.append(np.max(z))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `res` contains indices of characters in `al` that are present in `b`, `m` contains the maximum values of the differences calculated from the `zz` arrays formed during each iteration, and if `len(res)` is 0, `m` remains an empty list.
    if (len(m) > 0) :
        ans = np.min(m)
    else :
        ans = len(a)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `res` contains indices of characters in `a` that are present in `b`, if `m` contains maximum values of differences calculated from `zz` arrays, then `ans` is the minimum value from `m`. Otherwise, `m` is an empty list and `ans` is the length of `a`.
    ans -= 1
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, processes the characters to find the maximum gap between consecutive characters (based on their first occurrences), and prints the minimum of these gaps decreased by 1. If no characters from the alphabet are found in `s`, it prints the length of `s` minus 1. If `s` consists of the same character or has no gaps, it will return -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
