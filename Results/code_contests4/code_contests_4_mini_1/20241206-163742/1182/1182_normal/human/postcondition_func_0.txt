The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, processes the characters to find the maximum gap between consecutive characters (based on their first occurrences), and prints the minimum of these gaps decreased by 1. If no characters from the alphabet are found in `s`, it prints the length of `s` minus 1. If `s` consists of the same character or has no gaps, it will return -1.
