According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will execute for each index in the range of the length of `a`. Since `a` is obtained from `raw_input()`, we need to ensure that it is not an empty string for the loop to execute at least once. 

Given that `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, this does not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty string, and the index `k` should start from `0` since that is the first position in the range. 

Thus, we can summarize the states as follows:

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty string from raw_input(), `b` is an empty list, `k` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
