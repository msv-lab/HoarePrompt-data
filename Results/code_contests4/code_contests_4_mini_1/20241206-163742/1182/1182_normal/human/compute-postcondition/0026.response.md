Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, and `k` is 26. If 'z' is present in `b`, `res` is updated with the indices of 'z', which may be empty or contain indices depending on the contents of `a`. If 'z' is not present in `b`, `res` remains unchanged.***
