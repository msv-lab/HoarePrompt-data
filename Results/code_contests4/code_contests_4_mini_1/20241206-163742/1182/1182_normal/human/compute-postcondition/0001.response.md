The variable `b` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables, `s` and `a`, remain unchanged as the initialization of `b` does not alter them. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100; `a` is an input string from raw_input(); `b` is an empty list.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100; `a` is an input string from raw_input(); `b` is an empty list**
