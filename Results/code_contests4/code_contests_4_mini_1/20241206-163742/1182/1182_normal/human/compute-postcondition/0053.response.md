Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `res` contains indices of characters in `a` that are present in `b`, if `m` contains maximum values of differences calculated from `zz` arrays, then `ans` is the minimum value from `m`. Otherwise, `m` is an empty list and `ans` is the length of `a`.***
