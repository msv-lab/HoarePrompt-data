Output State: **`z` is an array containing [res[current_k + 1][0], len(a) - res[current_k + 1][0]] if current_k + 1 < len(res); `m` has a new maximum value from the elements in `z` if the length of `z` is greater than 0, otherwise, `m` remains unchanged; `zz` is a new array formed by horizontally stacking [0], `res[k][0]`, and [len(a)].**
