Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a numpy array containing all characters of `a`, `res` contains indices of characters in `a` that are present in `b`, `m` contains the maximum values of the differences calculated from the `zz` arrays formed during each iteration, and the length of `m` is greater than 0. If `len(res)` is 0, then `m` remains an empty list.***
