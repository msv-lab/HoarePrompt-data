The code `b.append(a[k])` appends the element at index `k` of the string `a` to the list `b`. Given that `k` is initialized to 0, it will take the first character of the string `a`. The other variables, `s` and `k`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, `b` will contain the first character of `a`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty string from raw_input(), `b` contains the first character of `a`, `k` is 0**
