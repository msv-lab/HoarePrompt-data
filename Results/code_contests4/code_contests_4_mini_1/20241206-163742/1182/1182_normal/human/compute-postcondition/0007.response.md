The variable `b` is a string that initially contains the first character of `a` and the character at index 1 of `a` if `len(a)` > 1. The code `b.append(a[k])` attempts to append the character at index `k` of `a` (which is 2) to `b`. To execute this code successfully, `len(a)` must be greater than 2 to ensure that accessing `a[2]` is valid. 

If `len(a)` is greater than 2, the value of `b` will change and include the character at index 2 of `a`. However, if `len(a)` is 2 or less, this operation cannot be performed because it would result in an index error. 

Assuming `len(a)` is greater than 2, `b` will have an additional character appended to it. If `len(a)` is 2 or less, the operation will not change `b`.

Therefore, the output state is dependent on the length of `a`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100; `a` is a non-empty string from raw_input(); `b` is either unchanged or contains the character at index 2 of `a`, depending on the length of `a`; `k` is 2 if `len(a)` > 2.**
