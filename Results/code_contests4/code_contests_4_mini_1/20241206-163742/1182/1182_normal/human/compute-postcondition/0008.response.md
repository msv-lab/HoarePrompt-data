The loop iterates over the string `a` and appends each character of `a` to the list `b`. After all iterations of the loop have completed, `b` will contain all characters from `a`, and the variable `k` will equal the length of `a`. 

If `a` is a non-empty string, `b` will contain all characters of `a` and `k` will be equal to `len(a)`. If `a` is empty (though it is given that it is non-empty), `b` would remain empty and `k` would be 0. However, since `a` is non-empty and the initial state confirms its non-empty nature, we focus on that.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100; `a` is a non-empty string from raw_input(); `b` contains all characters of `a`; `k` is equal to the length of `a`.**
