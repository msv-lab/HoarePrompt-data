#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, and the 4x4 table contains characters which are either digits from '1' to '9' or periods ('.'), where each digit represents a preferred time to press a panel.
def func():
    n = input()
    c = [0] * 10
    for i in range(4):
        for j in list(raw_input()):
            if j != '.':
                c[int(j)] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5; `n` is a non-empty string representing the preferred time to press a panel; `c` is a list where each index corresponds to the total count of occurrences of the digits '0' to '9' in all processed input strings.
    print['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= n * 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input `n`, which represents the maximum allowed occurrences of preferred times, processes a 4x4 grid of characters (digits '1' to '9' or periods '.'), counts the occurrences of each digit, and prints 'YES' if the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Note that the input handling assumes `n` is a valid integer and that the grid input is valid, but there is no explicit error handling for invalid inputs.
