The value of `j` is converted to an integer using `int(j)`, which is then used as an index to access the list `c`. The count at that index in `c` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `n` is a non-empty string, `c` is a list where the count at index `int(j)` is increased by 1, `i` is 4, and `j` is the first character from the non-empty input that is not equal to '.'.
