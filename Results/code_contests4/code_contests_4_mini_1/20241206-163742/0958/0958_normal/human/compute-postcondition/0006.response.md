Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5; `n` is a non-empty string representing the preferred time to press a panel; if `j` is not equal to '.', then the first element of list `c` is incremented by 1, `i` remains 0, and `j` is the first character of `n` that is not equal to '.'. If `j` is equal to '.', no changes occur to `c` or `i`, and `j` remains as the first character of `n` that is not equal to '.' if it exists.***
