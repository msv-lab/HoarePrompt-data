The value at index `int(j)` in the list `c` is increased by 1. Given that `j` is 4, we calculate `int(j)` which results in 4. Therefore, the count at index 4 in the list `c` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `n` is a non-empty string with at least 5 characters, `c` is updated such that `c[4]` is increased by 1, `i` is 4, and `j` is 4.**
