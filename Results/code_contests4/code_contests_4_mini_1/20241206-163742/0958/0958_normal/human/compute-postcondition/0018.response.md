Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `n` is a non-empty string representing the preferred time to press a panel, `c` is a list where each index corresponds to the count of occurrences of the digits '0' to '9' in `n`, `i` is 1, and `j` is the first character of the string input. If `j` is not equal to '.', then `c[int(j)]` is incremented by 1.***
