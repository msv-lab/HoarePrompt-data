To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we first analyze the provided information.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5.
   - `n` is a non-empty string representing the preferred time to press a panel.
   - `c` is a list of ten 0s.
   - `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```
   for j in list(raw_input()):
       if j != '.':
           c[int(j)] += 1
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop processes each character `j` in the input string `n`.
   - If `j` is not equal to '.', the corresponding index in the list `c` (based on the integer value of `j`) is incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue until all characters in the string `n` have been processed.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - If `n` consists of digits (from '0' to '9') and ignores any '.', `c` will reflect the count of each digit found in `n`.
   - The integer `i` remains 0, as it is not modified or incremented in the loop.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Taking all of this into account, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5; `n` is a non-empty string representing the preferred time to press a panel; `c` is a list where each index corresponds to the count of occurrences of the digits '0' to '9' in `n`, and `i` remains 0.**
