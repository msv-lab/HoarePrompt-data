Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `n` is a non-empty string representing the preferred time to press a panel. If the second character `j` is not a dot (i.e., `j != '.'`), then the count at index `int(j)` in list `c` is updated. The value of `i` remains 2, and `j` is the second character of the string input.***
