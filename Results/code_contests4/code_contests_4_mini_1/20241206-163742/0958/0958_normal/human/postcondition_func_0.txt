The function accepts an integer input `n`, which represents the maximum allowed occurrences of preferred times, processes a 4x4 grid of characters (digits '1' to '9' or periods '.'), counts the occurrences of each digit, and prints 'YES' if the maximum count of any digit is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Note that the input handling assumes `n` is a valid integer and that the grid input is valid, but there is no explicit error handling for invalid inputs.
