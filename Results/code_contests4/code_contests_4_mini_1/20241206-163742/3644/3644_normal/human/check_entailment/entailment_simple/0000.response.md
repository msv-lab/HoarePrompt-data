Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While the function `func()` outputs a series of "YES" and "NO" responses that represent whether the photographs have been rearranged or not, it does not implement the necessary logic to analyze the actual images based on the pixel values provided in the input.

Specifically, the program:

1. **Lacks Image Processing Logic**: The program should read the photograph data, split it into two halves, and compare the top half to the bottom half to determine if they are swapped. The current implementation does not perform any image processing or comparison of pixel values.

2. **Static Output**: The function simply returns a hardcoded list of responses without any reference to the input data or the actual questions. It does not dynamically assess the input pictures based on the criteria specified in the problem description.

3. **No Input Handling**: The function does not read the input file or process the questions as specified. It is expected to handle multiple questions, but the implementation does not address this requirement.

Due to these critical issues, the program does not fulfill the problem's expectations and cannot be considered correct.
