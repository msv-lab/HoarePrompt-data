Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Lack of Logic Implementation**: The program consists solely of a hardcoded output of "YES" or "NO" responses, without any actual logic to determine whether the images have been rearranged. The problem requires that the program assess the pixel brightness values based on their arrangement and then derive a conclusion about whether the top and bottom halves of the photograph have been swapped.

2. **No Input Processing**: The function does not read or process any input data, such as the dimensions of the photographs (h and w) or the actual pixel values. The program is supposed to read a series of questions from an input file, analyze the pixel data, and then output the appropriate answers. Instead, it only returns a predefined list of responses.

3. **Incorrect Output Generation**: The output is fixed and does not vary based on input, meaning it cannot adapt to different photographs or questions. This is contrary to the requirement that the program should evaluate each photograph based on the provided pixel values and determine if they have been rearranged.

4. **Missing Condition Assessment**: The problem description emphasizes that at least 75% of the answers need to be correct based on the actual arrangement of pixels. The program, however, does not implement any mechanism to ensure that it is generating the correct responses based on the input data.

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to determine whether the photos have been rearranged, does not read input data, and produces fixed outputs that do not correlate with the actual problem requirements. Therefore, it does not fulfill the task as outlined in the problem description.
