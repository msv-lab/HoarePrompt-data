Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not include any logic to determine if the photographs have been rearranged or not based on the pixel brightness values. Instead, it simply outputs a predetermined list of "YES" or "NO" responses without processing the input data. This means that it cannot correctly assess whether the photographs have been rearranged, failing to meet the problem description's requirement for evaluating the photographs based on their pixel data.

Additionally, the output hints indicate that the function outputs responses without any implemented conditions based on the pixel values, further confirming that the code lacks the necessary functionality to fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, it is incorrect.
