Precondition: **The function processes an input file containing q questions, where each question includes two integers h and w followed by h lines of w space-separated integers representing pixel brightness values. The constraints are 1 ≤ q ≤ 220, 1 ≤ h, w ≤ 600, and 0 ≤ aij < 256, with h guaranteed to be even.**
