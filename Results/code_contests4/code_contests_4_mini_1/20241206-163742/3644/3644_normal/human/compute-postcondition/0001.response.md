The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. Instead, it processes an input file containing `q` questions. Each question includes two integers `h` and `w` followed by `h` lines of `w` space-separated integers, which represent pixel brightness values. The constraints specify that `1 ≤ q ≤ 220`, `1 ≤ h, w ≤ 600`, and `0 ≤ aij < 256`, with `h` guaranteed to be even. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, so we cannot infer specific return values or conditions based on the input structure. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process structured input related to pixel brightness values across multiple questions.

Functionality: **The function processes an input file containing multiple questions about pixel brightness values, where each question includes dimensions and corresponding pixel values.**
