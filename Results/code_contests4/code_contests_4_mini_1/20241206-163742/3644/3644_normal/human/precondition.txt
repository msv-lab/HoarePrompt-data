q is an integer representing the number of questions (1 ≤ q ≤ 220), and for each question, h and w are integers representing the height and width of the photograph (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 600), followed by h rows of w space-separated integers representing the pixel brightness values (0 ≤ aij < 256). It is guaranteed that h is even.
