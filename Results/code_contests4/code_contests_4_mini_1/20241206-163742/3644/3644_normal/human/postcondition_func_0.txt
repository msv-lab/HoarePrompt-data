The function processes a series of questions related to pixel brightness values from an input file. Each question includes two integers indicating the dimensions (height and width) followed by the corresponding pixel brightness values. The function outputs a series of responses ("YES" or "NO") for each question, indicating whether certain conditions about the pixel values have been met. However, the exact conditions for these responses are not specified, and no logic is provided within the function to determine these conditions based on the pixel values. Therefore, the function lacks the necessary implementation to actually assess the pixel data and return meaningful results.
