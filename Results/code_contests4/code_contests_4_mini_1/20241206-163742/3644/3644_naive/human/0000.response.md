Correctness: **False**.

The program outputs a predefined set of responses without processing the actual input data or performing any checks to determine if the photographs have been rearranged or not. It does not evaluate the conditions described in the problem statement, such as whether the top halves of the photographs have been moved to the bottom. Therefore, it cannot correctly determine the answers for all potential cases based on the provided problem description. 

For example, if the input photograph has been rearranged, the program may incorrectly output "NO" if that corresponds to a question number where it has not been accounted for in its predefined output. Since the program lacks the necessary logic to evaluate the images, it will fail to provide correct answers for many scenarios.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements as it does not implement any logic to validate the rearrangement of photographs based on the provided dimensions and pixel values.
