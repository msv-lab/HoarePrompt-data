To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements for counting islands in the given terrain data.

### Breakdown of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple datasets, each consisting of 12 lines with 12 characters (either '1' or '0').
2. **Grid Construction**: It constructs a grid `g` where '1' represents land and '0' represents water.
3. **Visited Tracking**: A separate grid `visited` is used to track which squares have already been counted as part of an island.
4. **Island Counting**: The function `func_2` is called for each square in the grid. It marks the square as visited and recursively checks the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) for connected land squares.
5. **Counting Logic**: Each time a new '1' is found that hasn't been visited, it increments the island count.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Input Format**: The program uses `xrange`, which is not available in Python 3. It should use `range`. This could lead to a runtime error if run in Python 3.
2. **Input Handling with `raw_input`**: `raw_input` is not valid in Python 3; it should be replaced with `input()`.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The function `func_1` checks if the coordinates are within bounds, but it does not ensure that the current square is land ('1') before proceeding to mark it visited. It should check if `g[y][x] == '1'` within the bounds check.
4. **Handling of Blank Lines**: The program assumes that blank lines separate datasets; however, the way `try` and `except` are used might not handle all edge cases correctly, especially if inputs are malformed or if reading the datasets doesn't match the expected format.

### Potential Edge Cases
- If the input data includes an empty dataset (just a blank line), the program should properly handle that without throwing an error.
- If a dataset has no '1's at all, the program should correctly return `0` islands.
- If a dataset only consists of '1's, it should count it as a single island.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues, particularly with `xrange` and `raw_input`, along with potential mishandling of edge cases, the program does not correctly handle all scenarios as expected by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may fail to run at all in Python 3 due to the `xrange` and `raw_input` usage, and might not correctly count islands in some edge cases due to the checks and recursive logic.
