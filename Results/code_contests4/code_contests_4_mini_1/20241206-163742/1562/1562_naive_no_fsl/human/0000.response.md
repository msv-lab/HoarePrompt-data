To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it accurately counts the number of islands based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. The problem describes a grid (12x12) where black squares are represented by '1' and white squares by '0'.
2. An island is defined as either a single '1' or a group of contiguous '1's connected either vertically or horizontally.
3. The program is expected to read multiple datasets, each consisting of a 12x12 grid, and output the number of islands for each dataset.

### Code Analysis

The program includes two main functions and logic to process the input:

- **`func_1(y, x)`**: This function checks if the coordinates `(y, x)` are within the bounds of the grid (0 to 11).
  
- **`func_2(y, x)`**: This function is a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the grid:
    - It checks if the cell at `(y, x)` is '0', returning 0 if it is (meaning it's water).
    - If the cell is '1', it marks it as visited by setting `g[y][x]` to '0'.
    - It then explores the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
    - Finally, it returns `1` to signal that an island has been found.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Reading**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is valid in Python 2 but not in Python 3. If this code were to run in Python 3, it would raise an error.
  
2. **Data Structure**: The grid `g` is populated using `g[i].append(j)` where `j` is a character ('0' or '1'). However, in the DFS, `g[y][x]` is checked against '0' and '1', which might not be handled correctly if the input is treated as integers instead of strings.

3. **Termination Condition**: The while loop continues until an exception occurs. This may lead to an unexpected termination if the input is not properly formatted.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The program might not handle edge cases correctly, for instance, if the input contains fewer than 12 rows or malformed data.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program has several issues:
- It doesn't handle input correctly in Python 3.
- It assumes that the input will always be valid and in the expected format, which may not always be the case.
- There is a possibility of incorrect island counting if the DFS does not properly mark the visited islands due to potential misinterpretation of the grid values.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly follow the problem description under all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example Case**: If the input contains a row with fewer than 12 characters, or if it contains invalid characters, the program will not handle this gracefully and may produce incorrect results or crash.
