Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Function Logic**: The first function, `func_1`, is intended to check if the coordinates `(y, x)` are within the bounds of the grid (0 to 11). However, the implementation incorrectly uses `y` (which is a list) in the condition `(0 <= y <= 11)`, which is not valid. This should instead check the integer indices themselves, not the list. The correct check should be `0 <= y < 12 and 0 <= x < 12`.

2. **Data Structure Handling**: The second function, `func_2`, references a variable `g`, which is not defined within the function. The function should operate on the input list `y` that represents the grid. This leads to potential errors as the program does not have access to the grid data properly.

3. **Island Counting Logic**: Although `func_2` seems to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to mark connected components (black squares), it does not maintain a proper count of islands. The return value of `1` suggests that it counts one island for each call, but there is no mechanism in place to keep track of how many distinct islands have been counted across multiple calls to `func_2`.

4. **Input Handling**: The program does not appear to handle multiple datasets as described in the problem. It is vital to process each dataset, count islands for each, and output the result accordingly.

Overall, these issues indicate that the program will fail to correctly count the number of islands in the provided datasets and does not conform to the problem's requirements.
