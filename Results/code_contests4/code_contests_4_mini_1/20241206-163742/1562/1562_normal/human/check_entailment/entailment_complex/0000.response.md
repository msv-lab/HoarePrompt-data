Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the coordinates go out of bounds. In the annotations for `func_2`, the call to `func_1(nexty, nextx)` checks whether the coordinates are valid, but it incorrectly uses the variable `g` to access the grid instead of using `y`. Additionally, the condition `if not func_1(nexty, nextx):` does not account for the bounds of `nexty` and `nextx` properly. Since this could lead to an IndexError or incorrect behavior when `nexty` or `nextx` are out of bounds, the program fails to meet the correctness requirements for all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.

Furthermore, the annotations suggest that the function does not validate the contents or structure of `y` correctly, which could lead to unexpected results. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
