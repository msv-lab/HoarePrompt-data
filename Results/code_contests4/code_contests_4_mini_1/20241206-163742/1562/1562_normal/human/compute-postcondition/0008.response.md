The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 0 and the values of `y`, `nexty`, and `nextx` are not directly affected by this line, the output state reflects that the program will continue to the next iteration without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`y` is a list of 12 strings, each containing exactly 12 characters where each character is either '1' or '0'; `i` is 0; `nexty` is the result of concatenating the list `y` with the string `dy[0]`; `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[0]`; the function `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns false and we continue to the next iteration.**
