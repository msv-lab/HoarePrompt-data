The values of the variables do not change, but we continue the loop, skipping the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is a list of 12 strings; `i` is 1; `nexty` is a list formed by concatenating `y` and `dy[1]`; `nextx` is `x + dx[1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
