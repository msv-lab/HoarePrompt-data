The variable `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 1, which means we are accessing the second element of the list `dy`. The previous value of `y` is a list of 12 strings, and `dy[i]` is the second element of the list `dy`. Since `y` is a list and `dy[i]` is a string, the resulting `nexty` will be a concatenated list of `y` and `dy[i]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is a list of 12 strings; `i` is 1; `nexty` is a list formed by concatenating `y` and `dy[1]`.

Output State: **`y` is a list of 12 strings; `i` is 1; `nexty` is a list formed by concatenating `y` and `dy[1]**
