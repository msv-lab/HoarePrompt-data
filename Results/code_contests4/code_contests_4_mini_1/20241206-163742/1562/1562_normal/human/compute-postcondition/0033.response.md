Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `y` containing 12 strings of 12 characters each, where each character is either '1' (representing a black square) or '0' (representing a white square). It checks the value at the coordinates specified by `y` and `x`. If the value is '0', it returns 0. Otherwise, it marks that position as '0', indicating it has been visited. It then explores adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) recursively. If any adjacent position is a '1' and has not been visited, it continues the exploration. The function ultimately returns 1 if it successfully visits a position that was '1', or 0 if the initial position was '0'. It does not handle cases where the coordinates go out of bounds or where `func_1` returns False.**
