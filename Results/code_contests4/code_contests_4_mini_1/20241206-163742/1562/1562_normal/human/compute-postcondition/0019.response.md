The code assigns the value `1` to `visited[nexty][nextx]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `nexty` is a list formed by concatenating `y` and `dy[1]`, and `nextx` is calculated as `x + dx[1]`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is a list of 12 strings; `i` is 1; `nexty` is a list formed by concatenating `y` and `dy[1]`; `nextx` is `x + dx[1]`; and `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`y` is a list of 12 strings; `i` is 1; `nexty` is a list formed by concatenating `y` and `dy[1]`; `nextx` is `x + dx[1]`; `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1.**
