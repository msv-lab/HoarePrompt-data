The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `y` and `x`. The parameter `y` is a list of 12 strings, each containing exactly 12 characters where each character is either '1' (representing black squares) or '0' (representing white squares). The parameter `x` is unspecified in the provided constraints. 

After executing the function body, if a condition is met, the function returns the integer 0; if another condition is met, it returns the integer value 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list `y` of 12 strings containing '1' and '0', and then return either 0 or 1 based on certain conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter y, which is a list of 12 strings of 12 characters each containing '1' or '0', and returns either 0 or 1 based on specific conditions.**
