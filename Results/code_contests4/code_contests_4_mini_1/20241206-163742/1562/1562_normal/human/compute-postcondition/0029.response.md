Postcondition: ***`y` is a list of 12 strings; `i` is 2; `nextx` is `x + dx[2]` (value cannot be determined). If `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', then `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1 and the function `func_2` is called with `nexty` and `nextx`. If the condition is not met, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
