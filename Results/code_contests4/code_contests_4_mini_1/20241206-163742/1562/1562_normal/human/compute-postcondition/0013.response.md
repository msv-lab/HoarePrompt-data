Postcondition: ***`y` is a list of 12 strings, each containing exactly 12 characters where each character is either '1' or '0'; `i` is 0; `nexty` is the result of concatenating the list `y` with the string `dy[0]`; `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[0]`; if `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', then `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` remains '1', and `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is called. Otherwise, no changes are made to `visited[nexty][nextx]` or `g[nexty][nextx]`.***
