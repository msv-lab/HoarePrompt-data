To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_3` and `func_4` functions, which are responsible for checking if the given bitstring can be transformed into a k-balanced bitstring.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. A k-balanced bitstring requires every substring of size k to have an equal number of '0's and '1's.
2. The string can contain '?' characters that can be replaced with either '0' or '1'.
3. The input consists of multiple test cases.

### Analyzing the Code:
- The program defines several functions; however, the main logic is encapsulated within `func_3` and `func_4`.
- `func_3` attempts to fill in the '?' characters based on the existing characters in the string, ensuring that the replacements do not violate the k-balanced condition.
- It checks if the characters at intervals of k are consistent, and if they are '?', it replaces them with the known character from the same group.
- At the end of the function, it counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in the first k characters and checks if they can be balanced with the '?' characters.

### Potential Case Examination:
One potential case that the program does not handle correctly is when there are no '?' characters but the characters are not balanced. Consider the following example:

- **Test Case:**
  ```
  4 4
  1111
  ```

In this case:
- The string is `1111`, and there are no '?' characters.
- The substring of size 4 has 4 '1's and 0 '0's, which is not balanced (2 of each is required).

However, the code would incorrectly return "YES" because it does not explicitly check if the existing string is already k-balanced before the replacement checks.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to identify scenarios where the input string is not already balanced and contains no '?' characters, which leads to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle cases where the string is already unbalanced without any '?' characters, leading to incorrect "YES" responses when the output should be "NO".
