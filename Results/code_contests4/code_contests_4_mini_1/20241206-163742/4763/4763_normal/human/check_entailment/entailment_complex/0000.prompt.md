You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called k-balanced if every substring of size k of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters (k/2 of each).

You are given an integer k and a string s which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a k-balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in s with either 0 or 1.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) — the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring.

The next line contains the string s (|s| = n). It is given that s consists of only 0, 1, and ?.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print YES if we can replace every ? in s with 0 or 1 such that the resulting bitstring is k-balanced, or NO if it is not possible.

Note

For the first test case, the string is already a 4-balanced bitstring.

For the second test case, the string can be transformed into 101.

For the fourth test case, the string can be transformed into 0110.

For the fifth test case, the string can be transformed into 1100110.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the length of the string s (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even), and s is a string of length n composed only of characters '0', '1', and '?'.
def func_1(n):
    return set(reduce(list.__add__, ([i, n // i] for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5
    ) + 1) if n % i == 0)))
    #The program returns a set of divisors of the integer n, where each divisor i is paired with n // i, resulting in all unique factors of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns a set of unique divisors of `n`. It computes the divisors by iterating from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility, and collecting both the divisor and its corresponding quotient `n // i`. Note that the function does not handle any edge cases explicitly, but it assumes that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string s, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.
def func_2(n):
    arr = [1] * n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                arr[j] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` contains the smallest prime factor for each index from 2 to `n-1`; indices that are prime will contain their respective prime number, and non-prime indices will contain the smallest prime factor that divides them.
    return arr
    #The program returns the array 'arr' containing the smallest prime factor for each index from 2 to n-1, where prime indices contain their respective prime numbers and non-prime indices contain their smallest prime factor.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns an array containing the smallest prime factor for each index from 2 to n-1. If an index is prime, it contains the index itself; if it is not prime, it contains the smallest prime factor that divides it. However, the function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2, which might lead to unexpected behavior or an empty array.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of strings where each string consists of characters '0', '1', and '?', and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ len(arr[i]) for each string arr[i]. The total length of all strings in arr does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
def func_3(arr, k):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != '?':
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                if arr[j] != arr[i] and arr[j] != '?':
                    return False
                if arr[j] == '?':
                    arr[j] = arr[i]
        else:
            vis = set([])
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                if arr[j] != '?':
                    vis.add(arr[j])
            if len(vis) == 2:
                return False
            if len(vis) == 1:
                put = list(vis)[0]
                for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                    arr[j] = put
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of strings where all occurrences of '?' have been replaced with valid strings based on the preceding conditions, and no two different non-'?' strings exist at k-th spaced indices.
    dic = {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}
    for i in range(k):
        dic[arr[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of strings where all occurrences of '?' have been replaced with valid strings based on the preceding conditions; `dic` is updated to reflect the count of occurrences of '1', '0', and '?' in the first k elements of `arr`; `dic['1']` is the count of '1's in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`, `dic['0']` is the count of '0's in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`, and `dic['?']` is the count of '?'s in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`.
    if (dic['1'] != dic['0'] and dic['?'] != abs(dic['1'] - dic['0'])) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the conditions regarding counts of '1's, '0's, and '?'s in the first k elements of 'arr' are not met.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of strings where all occurrences of '?' have been replaced with valid strings based on the preceding conditions; `dic` is updated to reflect the count of occurrences of '1', '0', and '?' in the first k elements of `arr`; `dic['1']` is the count of '1's in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`, `dic['0']` is the count of '0's in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`, and `dic['?']` is the count of '?'s in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`. The counts of '1's and '0's are equal, or the count of '?'s is equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '1's and '0's.
    return True
    #The program returns True based on the counts of '1's and '0's being equal, or the count of '?'s being equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '1's and '0's.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `arr`, where each string consists of characters '0', '1', and '?', and an even integer `k`. It checks if the elements at indices spaced by `k` can be made consistent with each other by replacing '?' with '0' or '1'. The function returns `True` if the counts of '1's and '0's in the first `k` elements are equal, or if the count of '?'s equals the absolute difference between the counts of '1's and '0's. If any inconsistencies are found during the checks, such as different non-'?' strings at spaced indices, it returns `False`. Additionally, the function processes the entire list `arr` and handles cases where '?'s are present to ensure they are replaced correctly based on surrounding context.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); for each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) indicating the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring; s is a string of length n composed only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(input())
        
        if not func_3(arr, k):
            func_5('NO')
        else:
            func_5('YES')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer for each test case, `k` is an integer for each test case, `arr` is a list of characters from the input string for each test case, and `func_5` is called with 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the result of `func_3(arr, k)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case it accepts two integers, `n` (the length of a bitstring) and `k` (a parameter for balancing), and a string `s` composed of '0', '1', and '?'. It checks if the bitstring can be balanced using the helper function `func_3`, and returns 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on this evaluation. The function does not return any values; instead, it directly calls `func_5` to print the results.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) representing the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring; k is an even integer; s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. The total length of all strings in all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_5():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is even), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?; `sep` is assigned a value, `file` is assigned a value, `at_start` is False, `args` is empty or contains no more elements after the last iteration. The values of all elements in `args` have been converted to strings and written to `file`, separated by `sep` if more than one element exists.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is even), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?; `sep` is assigned a value, `file` is assigned a value, `at_start` is False, `args` is empty or contains no more elements after the last iteration, `file` has been written to with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, and if the flush parameter has been popped from kwargs and is set to True, then `file.flush()` has been executed to clear the output buffer. Otherwise, the output buffer remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a variable number of arguments and writes them to a specified output file, separated by a given separator. It also appends a specified end string after writing the arguments. The function does not process the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `s` in any meaningful way related to balanced bitstrings as described in the annotations. Instead, it primarily handles output formatting and writing, and if the flush parameter is set to True, it clears the output buffer. The function does not perform any operations related to the actual test cases or string manipulation described in the annotations.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the length of the string (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even), and y is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided, and the total length of all strings across test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is an empty string, `x` retains its initial value as a string, and a TypeError occurs due to an invalid operation (x % y) when trying to execute the loop.
    return x
    #The program returns the string 'x' while a TypeError occurs due to the invalid operation (x % y) before reaching the return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and a string `y`, but it attempts to perform an invalid operation (`x % y`) which will always result in a TypeError. Therefore, the function does not successfully return any value and raises an error instead.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
