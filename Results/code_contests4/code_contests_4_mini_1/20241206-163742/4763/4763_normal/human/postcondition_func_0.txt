The function accepts an integer `n` and returns a set of unique divisors of `n`. It computes the divisors by iterating from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking for divisibility, and collecting both the divisor and its corresponding quotient `n // i`. Note that the function does not handle any edge cases explicitly, but it assumes that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
