t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) representing the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring; k is an even integer; s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. The total length of all strings in all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
