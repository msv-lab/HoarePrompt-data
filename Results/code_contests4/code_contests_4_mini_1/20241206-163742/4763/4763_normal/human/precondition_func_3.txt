t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); for each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) indicating the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring; s is a string of length n composed only of characters '0', '1', and '?'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
