x is an integer representing the length of the string (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even), and y is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided, and the total length of all strings across test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
