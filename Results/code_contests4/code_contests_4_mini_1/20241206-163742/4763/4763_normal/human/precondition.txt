t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the string, k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ n), and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
