The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case it accepts two integers, `n` (the length of a bitstring) and `k` (a parameter for balancing), and a string `s` composed of '0', '1', and '?'. It checks if the bitstring can be balanced using the helper function `func_3`, and returns 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on this evaluation. The function does not return any values; instead, it directly calls `func_5` to print the results.
