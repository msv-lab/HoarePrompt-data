Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string and `vis` is a set containing one unique string. If `len(vis) == 1`, every k-th string from index `i` in `arr` is replaced by `put`, where `put` is the unique string from `vis`. The value of `i` is at least 0 and less than or equal to `len(arr)`.***
