Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then all elements indexed by `j` (where `j` is from `i` to `len(arr)` with step `k`) are either equal to `arr[i]` or remain unchanged, and `i` is less than `len(arr)`. If any element in this range was not equal to `arr[i]` and was not '?', the function would have returned False, indicating all conditions were satisfied. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is equal to '?', and if `len(vis) == 1`, every k-th string from index `i` in `arr` is replaced by `put`, where `put` is the unique string from `vis`. The value of `i` is at least 0 and less than or equal to `len(arr)`.***
