Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string. If `len(vis) == 1`, then `put` is the unique element in `vis`, and `put` is placed at indices of `arr` that are multiples of `k`, while `i` is set to 0. The set `vis` contains one unique element, and `k` remains a positive integer.***
