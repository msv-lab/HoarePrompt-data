The variable `vis` is initialized as an empty set. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. The state of `arr` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, and the last element of `arr` is equal to '?' while `vis` is an empty set.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, the last element of `arr` is equal to '?', and `vis` is an empty set.**
