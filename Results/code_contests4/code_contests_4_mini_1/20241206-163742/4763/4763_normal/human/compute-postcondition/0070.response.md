The code `vis.add(arr[j])` adds the element at index `j` of `arr` to the set `vis`. Since `j` is currently `len(arr) - 1`, it refers to the last element of the array `arr`. However, it is given that the last element is equal to '?', and the element at index `j` (which is the last element) is not equal to '?', indicating a contradiction in the provided initial state. Assuming the last element is not '?', the value would be added to `vis`.

The state of `vis` changes as it now includes the element `arr[j]`. Other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a list of strings, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `vis` now contains one element, which is `arr[j]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings, `i` is len(arr) - 1, `j` is len(arr) - 1, `vis` now contains the element `arr[j]`**
