According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`. Given that `i` is 0 and `arr` has at least 1 string, the loop can execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` will be equal to `i` for the first iteration, which means `j` is 0. After the iteration, `j` will be incremented by `k`, so the next value of `j` will be `k`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `len(arr)`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the next value of `j` is `k`, and we require that `k` is less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is 0, `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]`, `j` is `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `k`.**
