To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current state and the conditions under which the loop can execute again.

1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current index in the list `arr`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.
2. Since `arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `len(arr)` is at least 1. 
3. If `i` is currently at the last index of `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`), the loop will not execute again unless `i` is incremented.
4. At the end of the last iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.
5. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` should be one greater than its previous value, which means `i` becomes `len(arr)`.

Thus, the state of the program would reflect the current value of `i` and the necessary condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr)`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(arr)`**
