Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings where all occurrences of '?' have been replaced with valid strings based on the preceding conditions; `dic` is updated to reflect the count of occurrences of '1', '0', and '?' in the first k elements of `arr`; `dic['1']` is the count of '1's in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`, `dic['0']` is the count of '0's in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`, and `dic['?']` is the count of '?'s in `arr[0]` to `arr[k-1]`. The counts of '1's and '0's are equal, or the count of '?'s is equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '1's and '0's.***
