According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(arr)`, since the `range` function will generate numbers starting from `i` up to (but not including) `len(arr)` with a step of `k`.

Given that `i` is currently equal to `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute as the starting point of the range is equal to the end point. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(arr)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to set `i` to `len(arr) - 1` (the last valid index) and ensure that `j` starts at this adjusted `i`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `len(arr) - 1` and `k` is a positive integer.**
