The variable `put` is assigned the value of the first element of the list created from the set `vis`. Since `vis` is an empty set and its length is equal to 1, it must contain one string. Therefore, `put` will be that string. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr)`, `vis` is an empty set, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, and the length of `vis` is equal to 1; `put` is the only string in `vis`.**
