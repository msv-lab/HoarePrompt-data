To analyze the final output state of the program after the loop has executed, we consider the following:

1. The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list of strings containing at least one string, `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, the last element of `arr` is equal to '?', and `vis` is an empty set.
2. The loop starts at index `i` (which is `len(arr)`) and increments by `k` for each iteration. Since `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute, as the starting index is out of bounds for the list.
3. Therefore, `vis` remains unchanged (empty), and no elements from `arr` are added to `vis`.

Given this analysis, we conclude that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output states of the variables will be:

- `arr` is still a list of strings with at least one string.
- `i` remains equal to `len(arr)`.
- `j` does not exist as the loop does not execute.
- `vis` remains an empty set.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr)`, and `vis` is an empty set.**
