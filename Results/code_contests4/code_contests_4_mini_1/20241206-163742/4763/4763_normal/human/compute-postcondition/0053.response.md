The code assigns the value of `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`. Given that the element at index `j` of `arr` is equal to the element at index `i` of `arr`, or the element at index `j` of `arr` is equal to '?', and the element at index `j` of `arr` is equal to '?', the value of `arr[j]` will now be the same as `arr[i]`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the other elements of `arr` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, `k` is a positive integer, and `arr[j]` is now equal to `arr[i]`.**
