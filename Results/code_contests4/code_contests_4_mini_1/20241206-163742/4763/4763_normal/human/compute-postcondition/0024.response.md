Functionality: ** The function accepts a variable number of arguments and writes them to a specified output file, separated by a given separator. It also appends a specified end string after writing the arguments. The function does not process the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `s` in any meaningful way related to balanced bitstrings as described in the annotations. Instead, it primarily handles output formatting and writing, and if the flush parameter is set to True, it clears the output buffer. The function does not perform any operations related to the actual test cases or string manipulation described in the annotations. **
