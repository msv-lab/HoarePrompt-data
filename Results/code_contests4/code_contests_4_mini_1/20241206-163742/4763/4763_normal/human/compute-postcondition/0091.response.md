Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is the length of `arr`, and `vis` is an empty set initially. If the length of `vis` is 1, then all elements of `arr` at indices greater than or equal to `len(arr) - 1` are assigned the value of `put`, `i` becomes `len(arr) - 1`, `vis` contains only the string `put`, and `put` is the sole member of `vis`. If the length of `vis` is not 1, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
