According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `len(arr)`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, which is less than `len(arr)`. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be updated to `j + k`, and it must still be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
