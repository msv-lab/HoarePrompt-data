According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`, which is `len(arr)`, and the step size `k`. The loop starts at `i` and continues until it is less than `len(arr)`, incrementing by `k` each time. 

Here, since `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute because the starting value `j` (which is `i`) is not less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. 

Additionally, `k` must be a positive integer to ensure that the loop can increment `j` correctly. 

Currently, `vis` contains only one string and has a length of 1, which satisfies the condition about `vis` not being equal to 2. However, since the loop will not execute as `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `vis` is an empty set, the length of `vis` is 1, `put` is the only string in `vis`, and `k` is a positive integer.**
