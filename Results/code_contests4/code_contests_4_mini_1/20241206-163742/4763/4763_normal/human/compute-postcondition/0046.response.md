Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then for all indices `j` from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k`, the elements are either equal to `arr[i]` or were originally '?', which have been replaced by `arr[i]`. If any element was not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to '?', the function would return False. If `arr[i]` is equal to '?', and if `len(vis) == 1`, then `put` becomes the unique element in `vis`, which is placed at indices of `arr` that are multiples of `k`, while `i` is reset to 0, and `k` remains a positive integer.***
