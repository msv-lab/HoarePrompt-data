Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is even), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?; `sep` is assigned a value, `file` is assigned a value, `at_start` is False, `args` is empty or contains no more elements after the last iteration, `file` has been written to with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, and the flush parameter has been popped from kwargs, which is set to True.***
