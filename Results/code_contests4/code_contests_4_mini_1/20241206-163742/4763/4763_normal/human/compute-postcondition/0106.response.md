According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the index variable `j` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i` and increments by `k` after each iteration. Since at the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least one string, `j` must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is `i + (number of iterations * k)`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `j + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`, and the next value of `j` will be `j + k`.**
