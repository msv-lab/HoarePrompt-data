The variable `j` is calculated as `i + k`, and it is used to access the element at that index in the list `arr`. The operation `vis.add(arr[j])` adds the string located at index `j` of `arr` to the set `vis`. Since the loop condition specifies that `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`, we can conclude that `j` is a valid index within the bounds of `arr`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the contents of `arr` and `vis` remain unchanged except for the addition of `arr[j]` to `vis`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string; `j` is `i + k`; `vis` now includes the string at index `j` from `arr`.**
