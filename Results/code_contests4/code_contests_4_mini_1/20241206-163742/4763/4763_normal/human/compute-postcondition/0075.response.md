According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and the length of `arr`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments by `k` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, and `j` is currently set to the starting index `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than the length of `arr`. Since `j` was `i` at the end of the last iteration, after the next iteration `j` will be incremented by `k`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i + k` must be less than the length of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `j` is `i + k`, for the loop to execute one more time `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`.**
