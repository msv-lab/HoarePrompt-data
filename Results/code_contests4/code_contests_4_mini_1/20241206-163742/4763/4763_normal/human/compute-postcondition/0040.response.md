According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `j`, which starts at `i` (0) and increments by `k` each time through the loop, continuing as long as `j` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr` has at least 1 string, which means `len(arr)` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `k`, making `j` equal to `0 + k`, which is `k`. To execute again, `k` must be less than the length of `arr`. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be `k`, which requires that `len(arr)` is greater than `k`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is 0, `vis` is a set containing one unique element, `k` is a positive integer, `put` is the unique element in `vis`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `k`, and `j` is `k`.**
