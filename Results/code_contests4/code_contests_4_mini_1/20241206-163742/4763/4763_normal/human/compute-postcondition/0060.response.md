According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which starts at `i` and increments by `k` in each iteration until it reaches the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + m*k` where `m` is the number of completed iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than the length of `arr`. Therefore, `j` will be updated to `i + (m + 1)*k`.

Since `arr` is a list of strings containing at least one string, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of strings containing at least one string, `j` is equal to `i + m*k`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`, and `j` will be `i + (m + 1)*k`.**
