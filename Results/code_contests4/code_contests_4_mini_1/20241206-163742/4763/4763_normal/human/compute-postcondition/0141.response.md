According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop indicates that `arr` is a list of strings with specific conditions met, and `dic` has counts for '1', '0', and '?'. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments are necessary:
- `k` must be greater than 0 so that the loop can run at least once.
- `i` should be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings where all occurrences of '?' have been replaced with valid strings based on the preceding conditions, no two different non-'?' strings exist at k-th spaced indices, `dic` is {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
