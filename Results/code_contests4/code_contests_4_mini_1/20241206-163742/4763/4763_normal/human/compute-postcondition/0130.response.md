According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `i` must be less than `len(arr)`, as the loop iterates from `i` to `len(arr)` in steps of `k`. Given that `arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, we know `len(arr)` is at least 1. The variable `i` is defined as `len(arr) - k` or less, which means `i` could potentially be equal to or less than `len(arr) - 1`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(arr)` after evaluating its initial state. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is a valid starting point within the bounds of the list. If `k` is such that `len(arr) - k` is negative or `i` is not less than `len(arr)`, then it would prevent the loop from executing.

Assuming the condition `i < len(arr)` holds true with `i` being set to `len(arr) - k`, it implies that `k` must be at least 1 and `i` should not be less than 0. 

Thus, the necessary state adjustments are:
- The value of `i` must be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `vis` is a set containing one unique string, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr)`, `put` is that unique string from `vis`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be less than `len(arr)` and `j` should start at `i`**
