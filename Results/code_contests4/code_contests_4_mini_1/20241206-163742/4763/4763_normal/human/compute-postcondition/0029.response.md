According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. The loop starts from index `i` and increments `j` by `k` in each iteration until it reaches the length of `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `i` and must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute again. Since `arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, we know `len(arr)` is at least 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to calculate the new value of `j`. Since `j` is increased by `k` in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be in the range `[i, len(arr))`. 

Thus, the conditions for the next iteration are:
- `j` should be less than `len(arr)`, which means `i + k` should also be less than `len(arr)`.

Assuming `j` at the end of the last iteration was calculated as `j = i + m*k` (where `m` is the number of completed iterations), we can state that for the loop to execute again, `j` will be `j + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `j` is `j + k`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**.
