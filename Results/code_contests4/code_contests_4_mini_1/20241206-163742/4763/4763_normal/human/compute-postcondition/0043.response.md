The code assigns the value of `put` (which is the unique element in `vis`) to the index `j` of the list `arr`. Since it is given that `j` is equal to `k`, the specific index in `arr` being modified is `k`. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` remains a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is 0, `vis` is a set containing one unique element, `k` is a positive integer, `put` is the unique element in `vis`, and `arr[k]` is now equal to `put`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is 0, `vis` is a set containing one unique element, `k` is a positive integer, `put` is the unique element in `vis`, and `arr[k]` is now equal to `put`.**
