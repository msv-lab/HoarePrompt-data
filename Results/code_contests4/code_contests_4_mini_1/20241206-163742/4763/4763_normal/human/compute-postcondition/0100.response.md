Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, and `j` is equal to `i`. If `arr[j]` is equal to `'?'`, then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `'?'`, then `arr[j]` remains unchanged and still equals `arr[i]`.***
