Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, and `j` is equal to `i + k`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the function returns False. If `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[i]` or `arr[j]` is equal to '?', the function does not return anything (None).***
