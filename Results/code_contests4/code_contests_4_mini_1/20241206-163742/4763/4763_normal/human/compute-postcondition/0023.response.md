The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it also considers the parameters `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the string, `k`, which is an even integer, and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. Based on these inputs, the function processes the test cases and returns results accordingly. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes an integer `n` (length of the string), an even integer `k`, and a string `s` of length `n`. It processes these inputs to return results for each test case based on the specified criteria for balanced bitstrings.**
