According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop starts at `i`, which is equal to `len(arr)`, and goes until `len(arr)`, stepping by `k`. If `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute because the starting point of the loop is equal to the ending condition. 

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `i` should be less than `len(arr)`. Since `i` is currently equal to `len(arr)`, it needs to be adjusted to be one less than `len(arr)` (i.e., `i` should be `len(arr) - 1`), and `j` should then be initialized to this new value of `i`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need:
- `i` to be adjusted to `len(arr) - 1` (which now points to the last valid index of `arr`).
- `j` to be initialized to this new value of `i`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is now `len(arr) - 1`, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, `vis` is an empty set, and the last element of `arr` is equal to '?'**
