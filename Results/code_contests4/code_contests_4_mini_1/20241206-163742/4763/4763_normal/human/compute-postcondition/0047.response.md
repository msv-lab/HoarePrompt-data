According to the code, the loop's ability to execute depends on the variable `i`, which iterates over the length of the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `len(arr)`, but since the loop condition checks for `i` being less than `len(arr)`, it will not execute again after reaching this point. 

Therefore, the next state should reflect that `i` is now equal to `len(arr)`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations, and there will be no further execution. 

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is equal to `len(arr)`**
