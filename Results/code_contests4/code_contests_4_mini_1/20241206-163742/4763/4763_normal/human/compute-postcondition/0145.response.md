According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings where all occurrences of '?' have been replaced with valid strings based on the preceding conditions; `dic` is updated with dic[arr[1]] += 1; `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 2**.
