According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - k`, meaning the next value of `j` will be `len(arr) - k + k`, which simplifies to `len(arr)`. 

Since `j` must be less than `len(arr)` for the loop to execute again, and `j` will be equal to `len(arr)` in the next iteration, the loop cannot execute again. 

Thus, `arr` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, to prepare for another iteration, we need to set `j` as `len(arr)` and ensure some condition holds true about `arr[j]`, which will lead to the loop being able to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr) - k`, for the loop to execute one more time `arr` must have at least one more string, and `j` will be `len(arr)`**
