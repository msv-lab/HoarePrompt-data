The code `vis.add(arr[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `arr` to the set `vis`. The value of `j` is previously defined as `j + k`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must remain less than `len(arr)`. Since `arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, the operation will add the string at index `j` to the set `vis`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `j` is `j + k`, and the string at index `j` has been added to the set `vis`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `j` is `j + k`, and the string at index `j` has been added to the set `vis`.**
