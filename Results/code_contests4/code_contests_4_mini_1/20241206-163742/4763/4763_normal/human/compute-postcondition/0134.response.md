According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `k`, and `len(arr)`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments by `k` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + k`. For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `j` must still be less than the length of `arr`. 

Currently, `j` is `i + k`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, we need to set `j` to `i + 2k` for the next iteration, and `i` remains unchanged as it is at least `0` and less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` has the string at index `j` replaced by `put`, `vis` remains a set containing one unique string, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `i + 2k` and for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `len(arr)`**
