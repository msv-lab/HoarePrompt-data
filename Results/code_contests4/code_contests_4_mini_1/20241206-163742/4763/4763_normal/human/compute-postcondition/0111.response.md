Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings where all elements indexed by `j` (where `j` is from `i` to `len(arr)` with step `k`) are either equal to `arr[i]` or remain unchanged, and `i` is less than `len(arr)`. If any element in this range was not equal to `arr[i]` and was not `'?'`, the function would have returned False, but since it did not return, all conditions were satisfied.**
