The function `func_6` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. `x` is an integer representing the length of the string, and `y` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. The function attempts to perform an operation involving `x` and `y`, which leads to a TypeError due to an invalid operation (x % y) before reaching the return statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `x` and a string `y`, but it encounters a TypeError due to the invalid operation before it can return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and a string `y`, but raises a TypeError due to an invalid operation (x % y) before returning any value.**
