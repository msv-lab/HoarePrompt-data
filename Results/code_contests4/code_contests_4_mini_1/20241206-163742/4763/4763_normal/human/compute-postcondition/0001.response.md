In the given code snippet, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the value of `x % y`. The initial state indicates that `x` is an integer representing the length of the string `y`, which consists only of the characters 0, 1, and ?. 

To analyze the impact:
- The value of `y` is a string, and `x` is an integer. 
- When `x` is assigned `y`, `x` will now hold the string value of `y`.
- The operation `x % y` is not valid because you cannot perform the modulus operation between an integer and a string. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` takes the value of `y`, and `y` cannot be assigned a valid value because of the type mismatch. 

Output State: **`x` is the string `y`, and `y` is not assigned a valid value due to type mismatch in `x % y`.**
