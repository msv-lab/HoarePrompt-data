Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), `s` is a string of length `n`, `sep` is assigned a value, `file` is assigned a value, `at_start` is False, and `args` must contain at least one more element for the loop to execute one more time. If `at_start` is False, the value of `sep` is written to `file`.***
