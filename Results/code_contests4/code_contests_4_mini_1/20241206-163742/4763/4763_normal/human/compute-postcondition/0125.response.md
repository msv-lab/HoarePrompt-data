Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `vis` is a set containing all unique strings from `arr` at indices that are not equal to '?' and are spaced by `k` starting from `len(arr)` - `k`, `i` is `len(arr) - k` or less depending on the length of `arr`, and the number of unique strings in `vis` is exactly 2.***
