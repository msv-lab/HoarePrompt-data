According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `i`, the length of `arr`, and the step size `k`. The loop iterates from `i` to `len(arr)` with a step of `k`. Since `i` is initialized to `len(arr)`, this means the starting point of the loop is already at the length of `arr`. 

If `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, the loop will not execute because the range starts and ends at the same point. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `i`. Since `i` is currently `len(arr)`, we can set `i` to `len(arr) - k` (provided `k` is positive and `len(arr) > k`) or ensure `k` is less than `len(arr)` and set `i` to 0. 

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr) - k` (for k > 0 and len(arr) > k), `vis` is an empty set**.
