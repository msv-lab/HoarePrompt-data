According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k`. The loop starts at index `i` and increments `j` by `k` in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of strings with at least one string. The index `j` is the current index being processed, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(arr)`. 

Since the last string in `arr` (at index `j`) is not equal to '?', a new string from `arr` has been added to the set `vis`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we will increment `j` by `k`. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + k`. 

For the loop to execute again, the condition `j < len(arr)` must hold true. This means that `i` must also be such that `i + k` is still less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, for the loop to execute one more time `j` will be updated to `j + k`, and it must be less than `len(arr)`**
