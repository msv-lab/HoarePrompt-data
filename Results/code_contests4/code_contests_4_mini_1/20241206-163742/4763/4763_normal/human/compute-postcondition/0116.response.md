The code `vis.add(arr[j])` adds the j-th element of the list `arr` to the set `vis`. Since `arr` is a list of strings and the j-th element is specified to be not equal to '?', this means that a valid string from `arr` is being added to the set `vis`. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged, and the set `vis` will now contain one additional element, which is `arr[j]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr) - k`, `vis` contains the element `arr[j]` where the j-th element of `arr` is not equal to '?'.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is `len(arr) - k`, `vis` contains the element `arr[j]` where the j-th element of `arr` is not equal to '?'**.
