According to the code, the loop execution depends on the length of the list `arr` and the value of `i`. The loop starts at index `i`, which is currently 0, and increments by `k` on each iteration. Since `arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `len(arr)` is at least 1. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. Given that `i` is currently 0, it is valid for the loop to execute as long as `len(arr)` is greater than 0, which it is, since `arr` contains at least 1 string.

Therefore, to summarize the conditions for the loop to execute:
- `i` is 0 (which is valid since it is less than `len(arr)`)
- `j` will start at 0 (the value of `i`)

The state does not need any adjustments since the provided state already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is 0, `vis` is a set containing one unique element, `k` is a positive integer, `put` is the unique element in `vis`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
