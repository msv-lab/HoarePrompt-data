According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `len(arr)`. The loop starts from index `i` and continues as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i` for the first execution of the loop, and it increments by `k` in each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by `k`. Since `j` starts at `i`, after the next iteration it will be `j = i + k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the condition `j < len(arr)` must also hold true.

Given that `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr)`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute a second time, `i + k` must still be less than `len(arr)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with the string at index `j` (where `j` is at least `i` and less than `len(arr)`) replaced by `put`, `vis` remains a set containing one unique string, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(arr)`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `i + k`, and `j` will be `i + k`**
