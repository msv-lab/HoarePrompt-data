The code snippet assigns new values to `x` and `y`. The new value of `x` will be the old value of `y`, and the new value of `y` will be the result of `x % y`. Given that `x` is the string `y`, the operation `x % y` will raise a TypeError because the modulus operator cannot be used between a string and a string. Therefore, the program will not execute successfully.

Output State: **TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting**
