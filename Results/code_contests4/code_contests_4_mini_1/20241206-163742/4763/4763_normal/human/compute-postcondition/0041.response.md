The code assigns the value of `put` (which is the unique element from the set `vis`) to the `j`-th index of the list `arr`. Given that `j` is equal to `k`, this means that the element at index `k` of `arr` will be replaced by `put`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is 0, `vis` is a set containing one unique element, `k` is a positive integer, `put` is the unique element in `vis`, and `arr[k]` is now equal to `put`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is 0, `vis` is a set containing one unique element, `k` is a positive integer, `put` is the unique element in `vis`, and `arr[k]` is now equal to `put`.**
