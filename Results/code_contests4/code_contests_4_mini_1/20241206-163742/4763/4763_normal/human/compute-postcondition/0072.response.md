According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `j` is also `len(arr) - 1`. This means that during the last iteration, `j` points to the last element of the list `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by `k`, so `j` will become `len(arr) - 1 + k`. The loop can only execute again if this new value of `j` is still less than `len(arr)`. 

Thus, to summarize:
- `arr` is a list of strings with at least one string.
- `vis` contains the last element of `arr` if that element is not equal to '?'.
- For the loop to execute again, `len(arr)` must be greater than `len(arr) - 1 + k`.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `j` is `len(arr) - 1 + k`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(arr)` must be greater than `len(arr) - 1 + k`**.
