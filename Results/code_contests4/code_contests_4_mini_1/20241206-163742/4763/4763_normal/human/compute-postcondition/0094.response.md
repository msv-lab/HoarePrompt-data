According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `j`, which starts at `i` and increments by `k` until it is no longer less than `len(arr)`. Since `i` is initially `len(arr)`, `j` will be equal to `i` on the first iteration. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. 

Currently, `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, so it cannot allow the loop to execute a second time. To adjust the states for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be decreased to a value less than `len(arr)`. Also, since `j` will take on the value of `i` initially, `j` must be adjusted accordingly. 

Therefore, the states need to reflect that `i` is less than `len(arr)` and `j` must be set to the adjusted value of `i` for the second iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `i` (where i is less than len(arr))**
