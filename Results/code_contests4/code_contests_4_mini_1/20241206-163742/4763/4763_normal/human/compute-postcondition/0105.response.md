Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the function returns False. If `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[i]` or `arr[j]` is equal to '?', the function does not return anything (None).***
