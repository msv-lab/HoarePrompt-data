The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. The parameter `arr` is a list of strings, where each string consists of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. The parameter `k` is an even integer that satisfies the condition \(2 \leq k \leq \text{len(arr[i]})\) for each string `arr[i]`. After executing the function body, it can return either `True` or `False` based on various conditions. Specifically, if certain conditions regarding the elements in `arr` and their counts of '1's, '0's, and '?'s are met, it returns `True`. If those conditions are not satisfied, it returns `False`, along with specific indications for various cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of strings, and a parameter `k`, which is an even integer. It returns `True` if the conditions regarding counts of '1's, '0's, and '?'s in the first k elements of `arr` are met; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
