Output State: **`arr` is a list of strings where all occurrences of '?' have been replaced by the value of `arr[i]`, and if any element at index `j` (where `j` is in the range of the loop) is not equal to `arr[i]` and is also not '?', the function has returned False. `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `j` is the last index accessed during the loop if the loop was executed.**
