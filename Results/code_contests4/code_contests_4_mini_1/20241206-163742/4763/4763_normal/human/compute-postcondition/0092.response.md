Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of strings with at least one string. If the last element of `arr` is not '?', all occurrences of '?' in `arr` are replaced by `arr[i]`, and if any element at index `j` is not equal to `arr[i]` and is also not '?', the function returns False. If the last element of `arr` is '?', then if the length of `vis` is 1, all elements of `arr` at indices greater than or equal to `len(arr) - 1` are assigned the value of `put`, `i` becomes `len(arr) - 1`, and `vis` contains only the string `put`. If the length of `vis` is not 1, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
