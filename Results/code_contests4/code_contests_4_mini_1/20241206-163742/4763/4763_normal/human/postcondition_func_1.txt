The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns an array containing the smallest prime factor for each index from 2 to n-1. If an index is prime, it contains the index itself; if it is not prime, it contains the smallest prime factor that divides it. However, the function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2, which might lead to unexpected behavior or an empty array.
