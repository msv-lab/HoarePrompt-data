The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` which indicates the length of a list. It reads a list `a` of `n` non-decreasing integers and calls another function `func_2` with the frequency of the most common integer in the list `a`. The function does not return any values or handle cases where the list might not contain any elements, assuming the input adheres to the specified constraints.
