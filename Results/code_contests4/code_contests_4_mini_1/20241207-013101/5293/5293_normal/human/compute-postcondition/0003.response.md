According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute for each element in `args`. For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must contain at least one element. 

Since `t`, `n`, and the list of integers are provided but do not directly affect the execution of the loop, the key condition is that `args` needs to be a non-empty iterable. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to state that `args` is a list or another iterable containing at least one element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `args` is a non-empty iterable containing at least one element**
