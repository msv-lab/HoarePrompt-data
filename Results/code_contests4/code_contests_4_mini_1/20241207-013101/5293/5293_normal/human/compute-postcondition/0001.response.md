The code snippet provided indicates a print action where `sep` and `file` are assigned default values if they are not provided in `kwargs`. The initial state describes the variables involved but does not change any values. Therefore, the output will reflect the initial state along with the new values of `sep` and `file`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100); for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` where each `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) is in non-decreasing order (a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ … ≤ a_n); `sep` is ' '; `file` is sys.stdout.**
