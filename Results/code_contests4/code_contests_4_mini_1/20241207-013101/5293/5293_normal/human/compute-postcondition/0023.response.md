Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `args` is a non-empty iterable containing `n` elements; `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False; the default value of `end` is '\n' is written to `file`. If the `flush` argument is evaluated as True, the flush method is called on `file`, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the underlying stream.***
