The function `func_2` accepts parameters through the input constraints defined for the test cases. Specifically, it accepts a positive integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a positive integer `n`, along with a list of `n` integers where each integer is denoted as `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The list is required to be in non-decreasing order.

The output behavior based on the specified parameter conditions is not detailed in the provided information. Thus, we can only infer that the function processes these inputs according to its internal logic, which is unspecified.

In summary, the functionality of the function `func_2` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` non-decreasing integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The exact output behavior is unspecified.**
