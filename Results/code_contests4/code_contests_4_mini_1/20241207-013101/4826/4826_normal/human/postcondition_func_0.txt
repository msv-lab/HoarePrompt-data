The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and reads a list of `n` distinct integers representing coordinates. It calculates the smallest distance between any two consecutive coordinates and counts how many times this minimum distance occurs. The function then prints the smallest distance and the count of its occurrences.
