To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of cities.
   - It reads a list of integers representing the coordinates of the cities.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The coordinates are sorted. This is crucial because to find the minimal distance between pairs of cities, we only need to compare consecutive cities in the sorted list.

3. **Finding Minimal Distance**:
   - The variable `dist` is initialized to a very large value (2 * 10^9), which serves as the initial placeholder for the minimal distance found.
   - The program iterates through the sorted coordinates, checking the distance between each city and the next one (i.e., `coordinates[index + 1] - coordinates[index]`).
   - If a smaller distance is found, `dist` is updated, and `count` is reset to 1 (indicating there is one pair with this new minimal distance).
   - If the same minimal distance is found again, `count` is incremented.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all pairs, the program prints the minimum distance and the number of pairs that have this distance.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Correctness of calculation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimal distance between distinct cities by sorting the coordinates and only checking adjacent cities. This is efficient and ensures that no potential minimal distances are missed.
   - Since all coordinates are distinct, there are no edge cases where the distance would be zero.

- **Count of pairs**:
   - The counting logic is correctly implemented. The program resets the count when a new minimal distance is found and increments it when the same minimal distance is found again.

- **Performance**:
   - The program runs in O(n log n) due to the sorting step, which is efficient given the constraints (with n up to 200,000).

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the program meets all requirements outlined in the problem description. It calculates the minimal distance between cities correctly and counts the number of pairs that share this distance accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
