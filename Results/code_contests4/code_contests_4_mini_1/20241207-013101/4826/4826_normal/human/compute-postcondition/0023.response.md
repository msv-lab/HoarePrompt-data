Postcondition: ***`temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, then `count` is increased by 1 and `temp_dist` is recalculated. If `temp_dist` is not equal to `dist`, then `count` remains unchanged and `temp_dist` is recalculated.***
