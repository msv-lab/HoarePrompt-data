The variable `temp_dist` is assigned the value of `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `index` must be less than `len(coordinates) - 1`. Since `index` has just been incremented, `index + 1` is valid, and we can access `coordinates[index + 1]`. The variable `x` is the next element in `coordinates`. Therefore, `temp_dist` is calculated based on the values of `coordinates[index + 1]` and `x`.

The output state reflects the current values of the relevant variables involved in this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in `coordinates`, `index` has been incremented by 1, `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`.**
