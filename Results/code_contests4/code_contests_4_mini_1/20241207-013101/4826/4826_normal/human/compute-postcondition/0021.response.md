`count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `count` is increased by 1. The value of `temp_dist` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **variable `count` is increased by 1, `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`**
