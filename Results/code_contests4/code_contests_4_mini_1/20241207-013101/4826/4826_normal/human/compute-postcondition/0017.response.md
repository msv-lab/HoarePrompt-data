According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `coordinates` list and the `index`. The loop will execute as long as `index` is less than the length of `coordinates`. At the end of the last iteration, the `index` is such that it is currently less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `index` must be increased by 1. 

Therefore, if the `index` is at its current value, for the loop to execute again, `index` will be incremented by 1, and `x` will take the next value in `coordinates`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in `coordinates`, `index` is incremented by 1**
