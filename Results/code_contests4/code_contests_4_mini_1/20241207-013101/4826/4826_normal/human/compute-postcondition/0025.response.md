According to the code, the loop executes based on the `coordinates` list and the `index` variable. The loop will continue as long as `index` is less than `len(coordinates)`, which means if `index` is currently less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, the loop can execute again for the next element in `coordinates`.

At the end of the last iteration, `index` has been incremented by 1, which means it is currently pointing to the next element in the `coordinates` list, and `x` is the value of that element.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `index` needs to be less than `len(coordinates) - 1`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `index` must be incremented once more, and `x` will then correspond to the next element in the `coordinates` list. 

Thus, the required adjustments are:
- `index` becomes `index + 1`
- `x` becomes the next element in `coordinates` after the current `x`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in `coordinates`, `index` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `index` must be less than `len(coordinates) - 1`**
