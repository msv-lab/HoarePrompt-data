The variable `temp_dist` is assigned the value of `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1, which means it now points to the next element in `coordinates`. Therefore, `coordinates[index + 1]` is the element following the one at the updated `index`. The variable `x` is given as the next element in `coordinates`, so the calculation involves these two elements.

Since `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 200000, and `cities`, `coordinates`, and `x` are properly defined, we focus on the calculation of `temp_dist`. The exact values of `coordinates`, `index`, and `x` are not provided, but we know that `coordinates` is sorted and has at least 1 element.

Thus, the Output State reflects that `temp_dist` has been calculated based on the updated index and the current value of `x`.

Output State: **`temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`**
