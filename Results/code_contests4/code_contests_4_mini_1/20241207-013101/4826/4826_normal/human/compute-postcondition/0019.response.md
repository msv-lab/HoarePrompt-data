`dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`, which is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. The previous values of `temp_dist`, `coordinates`, `index`, and `x` are not specified, so we cannot determine the specific value of `dist`. However, we know that `dist` will hold the value of `temp_dist` after this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`; `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`.

Output State: **`temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`; `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`.**
