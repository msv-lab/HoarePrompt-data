The `coordinates` list is sorted in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `coordinates` is an iterable of integers obtained from the input line, but the specific values of `coordinates` are not provided. Sorting will rearrange the values in `coordinates` without affecting `n` or `cities`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the sorting of `coordinates`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order.**
