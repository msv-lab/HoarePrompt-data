The variable `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`. The previous values indicate that `temp_dist` is the difference between the second element in `coordinates` and `x`, and it is less than `dist` (which is initially 2000000000). The value of `dist` will now be equal to `temp_dist`, which is a non-negative integer since it represents a distance.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `dist` is equal to `temp_dist`, `count` is 0, `index` is 0, `x` is the first element in `coordinates`, and `temp_dist` is less than the previous value of `dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `dist` is equal to `temp_dist`, `count` is 0, `index` is 0, `x` is the first element in `coordinates`, `temp_dist` is less than 2000000000.**
