Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 0, `index` is 0, `x` is the first element in `coordinates`, `temp_dist` is the difference between the second element in `coordinates` and `x`, and `temp_dist` is greater than or equal to `dist`.***
