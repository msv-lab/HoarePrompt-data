Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is equal to `temp_dist`, `count` is 1, `index` is 0, `x` is the first element in `coordinates`, and `temp_dist` is less than 2000000000. Otherwise, `dist` is 2000000000, and `temp_dist` is the difference between the second element in `coordinates` and `x`. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, then `count` is set to 1, `index` remains 0, and `x` is the first element in `coordinates`.***
