Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in `coordinates`, `index` has been incremented by 1, `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. If `temp_dist` equals `dist`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
