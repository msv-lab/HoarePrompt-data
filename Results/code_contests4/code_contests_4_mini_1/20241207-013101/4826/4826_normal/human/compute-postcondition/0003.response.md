`dist` is assigned the value `2 * 10 ** 9`, which calculates to `2000000000`. The values of the other variables, `n` and `cities`, as well as `coordinates`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order; `dist` is 2000000000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order; `dist` is 2000000000**
