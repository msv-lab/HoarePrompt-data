The variable `coordinates` is assigned the result of `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`, which processes a line of input read from standard input, splitting it into individual strings, converting each string to an integer, and returning an iterable of these integers. The previous values of `n` and `cities` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is an iterable of integers from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `cities` is an input integer; `coordinates` is an iterable of integers from the input line.**
