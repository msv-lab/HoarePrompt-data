Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in `coordinates`, and `index` has been incremented by 1. If `index` is less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, then `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, `dist` is updated to the value of `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
