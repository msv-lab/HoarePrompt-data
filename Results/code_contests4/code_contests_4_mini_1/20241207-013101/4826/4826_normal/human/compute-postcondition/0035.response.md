The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates with the constraints that `n` is an integer where \( 2 \leq n \leq 200000 \), and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, with each integer in the range of \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the provided constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and a list a of n distinct integers (each in the range of -10^9 to 10^9) and returns a value based on these inputs.**
