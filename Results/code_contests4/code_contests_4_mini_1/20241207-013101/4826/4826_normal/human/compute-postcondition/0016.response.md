Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element. If `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, if `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is updated to `temp_dist`, `count` is set to 1, `index` is 0, `x` is the first element in `coordinates`, and `temp_dist` remains less than 2000000000. Otherwise, `dist` is set to 2000000000, and `temp_dist` is the difference between the second element in `coordinates` and `x`. If `temp_dist` equals `dist`, then `count` is set to 1, `index` remains 0, and `x` is the first element in `coordinates`. If `index` is not less than the length of `coordinates` minus 1, the program does not execute any of the conditions within the if block and retains the initial values of `dist`, `count`, `index`, and `x`.***
