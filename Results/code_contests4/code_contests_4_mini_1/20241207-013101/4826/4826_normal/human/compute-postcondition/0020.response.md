The value of `count` is initialized to 1. The states of `temp_dist` and `dist` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`; `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`; `count` is 1.

Output State: **`temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`; `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist`; `count` is 1**.
