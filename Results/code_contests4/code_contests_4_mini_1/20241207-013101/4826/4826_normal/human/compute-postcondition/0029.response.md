The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `cities` is an input integer, `coordinates` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in `coordinates`, `index` has been incremented by 1, `temp_dist` is calculated as `coordinates[index + 1] - x`, and `count` is increased by 1.
