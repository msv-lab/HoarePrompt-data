You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Welcome to PC Koshien, players. This year marks the 10th anniversary of Computer Koshien, but the number of questions and the total score will vary from year to year. Scores are set for each question according to the difficulty level. When the number of questions is 10 and the score of each question is given, create a program that outputs the total of them.



input

The input is given in the following format.


s1
s2
..
..
s10


The input consists of 10 lines, and the i line is given the integer si (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) representing the score of problem i.

output

Output the total score on one line.

Example

Input

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10


Output

55
Program:
```
k = 0
for i in range(10):
    k = k + int(input())
print(k)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
