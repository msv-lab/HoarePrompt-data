Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It reads 10 integer inputs, each representing the score of a question, and calculates the total score by summing them up. 

Here’s a breakdown of the code:

1. `k = 0`: Initializes a variable `k` to hold the cumulative score.
2. `for i in range(10)`: A loop that iterates 10 times, corresponding to the 10 questions.
3. `k = k + int(input())`: In each iteration, it reads an integer from the input (which represents the score of a question) and adds it to `k`.
4. `print(k)`: Finally, it prints the total score after all inputs have been processed.

The program handles the constraints set by the problem description (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) and correctly computes the sum of scores given in the specified format. There are no edge cases or scenarios where it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
