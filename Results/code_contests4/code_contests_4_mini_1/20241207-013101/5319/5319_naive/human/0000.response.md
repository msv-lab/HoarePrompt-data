Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly sums up the total score from 10 lines of input, each representing the score for a question. It initializes a variable `k` to 0, iterates 10 times to read the input scores, converts them to integers, and adds them to `k`. Finally, it prints the accumulated score. The input constraints (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) are satisfied by converting the input to integers, so all valid inputs will be processed correctly, leading to the correct output. There are no edge cases or inputs specified in the problem description that would cause the program to fail.
