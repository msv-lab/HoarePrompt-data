According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and it must still be less than 10.

State: **`k` is updated with the input integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 10**
