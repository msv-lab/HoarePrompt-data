The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads 10 integers from input, each representing the score of a problem. Each integer score `s_i` is guaranteed to be in the range of 0 to 100. After processing the input values, the function returns the computed result based on these scores. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read 10 integer scores from input, each between 0 and 100, and return a result based on these scores.

Functionality: **The function reads 10 integers from input, each representing a score in the range 0 to 100, and returns a result based on these scores.**
