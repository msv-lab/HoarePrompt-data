The value of `k` is updated with the expression `k = k + int(input())`. Initially, `k` is 0, and the value added to `k` will be the result of `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is now updated with the input integer, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`k` is updated with the input integer, `i` is 0**
