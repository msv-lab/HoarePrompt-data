According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over a range of 10, meaning it will execute 10 times regardless of the state of `k`. The variable `k` does not affect the execution of the loop, but it is initialized to 0. The loop variable `i` will take on values from 0 to 9 during the iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, the state of `i` needs to be initialized to its starting value of 0.

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
