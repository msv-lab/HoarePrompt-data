Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads exactly 10 lines of input, which is consistent with the problem statement that specifies the scores are given across 10 different lines.

2. **Score Calculation**: The program initializes a variable `k` to 0 and iterates 10 times (from 0 to 9). During each iteration, it reads an integer score from the input using `input()`, converts it to an integer, and adds it to `k`. This correctly accumulates the total score of the problems.

3. **Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints the total score `k`, which is the sum of the 10 input integers. This matches the requirement of outputting the total score on one line.

4. **Valid Range**: The program ensures that each score is converted to an integer, which adheres to the constraint \(0 \leq si \leq 100\). However, the program does not explicitly validate that the input scores fall within this range. Nonetheless, since the problem description states the range is guaranteed, this is not an issue.

Overall, the program successfully meets all the requirements of the problem description, correctly summing the scores and producing the expected output format. Therefore, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
