Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program is designed to read exactly 10 integers from user input, which is in accordance with the problem statement that specifies the input consists of 10 lines. Each line represents the score for a question.

2. **Score Range**: The program correctly handles the input scores within the specified range (0 ≤ si ≤ 100). The `int(input())` conversion ensures that the input is treated as an integer, and there are no constraints violated since it expects integers.

3. **Summation Logic**: The program initializes a variable `k` to 0 and then iteratively adds each of the 10 scores to `k`. This accurately calculates the total score for all questions as required.

4. **Output**: After summing the scores, the program prints the total, which matches the output requirement of the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality needed to solve the problem as described.
