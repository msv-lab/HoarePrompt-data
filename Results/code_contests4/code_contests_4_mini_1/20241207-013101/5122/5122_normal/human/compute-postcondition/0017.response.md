To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the behavior of the code:

The loop iterates over each element `e` in the map object `vs`. For each iteration, `res` accumulates the sum of all elements, and `minO` is updated to the minimum value encountered so far. 

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `vs` contains integers from user input.
- `minO` starts at -1 and will be updated during the loop.
- `res` starts at 0.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `res` will contain the sum of all integers in `vs`.
- `minO` will either be the minimum integer in `vs` (if at least one element exists) or remain -1 if the loop does not execute (which would only happen if `vs` is empty, which contradicts the given constraints since `n` is at least 1).

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `minO` is the minimum value in `vs`; `res` is the sum of all integers in `vs`.**
