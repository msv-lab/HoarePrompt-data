Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `minO` is either -1 or greater than `e`. If `minO` is -1 or greater than `e`, then `minO` is set to `e`, and `res` is increased by the value of `e`. The map object `vs` contains at least one integer, and `e` is the first element in `vs`.***
