The code `res -= minO` updates the value of `res` by subtracting `minO` from it. Given that `res` is the sum of all integers in `vs` and is an odd integer, subtracting a minimum value `minO` (which is also an integer) will affect the parity of `res`. 

If `minO` is odd, then subtracting it from an odd `res` will make `res` even. If `minO` is even, then `res` will remain odd after the subtraction.

Since the specific values of `minO` and `res` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `res`, but we know the following:

1. `res` is reduced by the value of `minO`.
2. The parity of `res` depends on whether `minO` is odd or even.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `minO` is the minimum value in `vs`; `res` is the sum of all integers in `vs` after subtracting `minO`; and `res` may be either odd or even depending on the parity of `minO`.**
