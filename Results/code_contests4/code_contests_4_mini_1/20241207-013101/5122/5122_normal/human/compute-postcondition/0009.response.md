According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in the map object `vs`. Since `vs` contains at least one integer, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is set to the first element in `vs`. For the loop to execute again, `e` will take the next element in `vs` during the next iteration. 

Now, since `vs` is a map object, it will yield elements one by one. After consuming the first element, there should still be more integers to proceed with the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `vs` must contain at least one more integer beyond the one that was just processed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `minO` is either -1 or greater than `e`, `res` has been increased by the value of `e`, for the loop to execute one more time `vs` must contain at least one more integer**
