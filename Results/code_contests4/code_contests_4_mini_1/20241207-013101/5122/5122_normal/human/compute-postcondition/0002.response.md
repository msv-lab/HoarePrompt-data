The variable `minO` is assigned the value `-1`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing integers from user input; `minO` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing integers from user input; `minO` is -1**.
