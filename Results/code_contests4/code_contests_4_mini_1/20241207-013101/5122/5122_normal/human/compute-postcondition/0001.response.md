The variable `vs` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes input from the user. The `raw_input()` function accepts a line of input, `split()` divides it into separate string components based on whitespace, and `map(int, ...)` converts each of those string components into integers. The previous value of `n` is not directly affected, but it sets the context that the input will be an integer.

Because `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, the output state will reflect the assignment of `vs` but won't change the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `vs` is a map object containing integers from user input**
