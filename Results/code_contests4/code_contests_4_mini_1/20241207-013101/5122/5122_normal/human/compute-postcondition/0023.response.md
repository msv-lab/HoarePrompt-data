Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a sequence of `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ each integer ≤ 1,000,000,000). It calculates the sum of these integers and identifies the minimum value among them. If the total sum is odd, it subtracts the minimum value from the sum before printing the result. The function does not return a value but instead prints the final computed sum, which may be either odd or even based on the initial input. **
