Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `minO` is the minimum value in `vs`; `res` is the sum of all integers in `vs`. If `res` is odd, then `res` is the sum of all integers in `vs` after subtracting `minO`, and `res` may be either odd or even depending on the parity of `minO`.***
