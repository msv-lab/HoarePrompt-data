`minO` is assigned the value of `e`. Since `minO` can either be -1 or greater than `e`, the specific value of `minO` will depend on the current value of `e`. The other variables `n` and `res` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `minO` is `e`; `res` has been increased by the value of `e`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `minO` is `e`; `res` has been increased by the value of `e**
