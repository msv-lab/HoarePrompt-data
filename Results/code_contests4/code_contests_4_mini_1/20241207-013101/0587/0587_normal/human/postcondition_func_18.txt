The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, both within the range of 0 to 1,000,000, and with the condition that their sum is greater than 0. It then iterates through integers `i` from 1 to 1,000,000 to find the smallest `i` such that `n` is less than or equal to half of `i`, `m` is less than or equal to a third of `i`, and the sum of `n` and `m` is less than or equal to the sum of half of `i`, a third of `i`, minus a sixth of `i`. If such an `i` is found, it calls `func_20(i)` and breaks the loop; if no valid `i` is found by 1,000,000, the function completes without calling `func_20`.
