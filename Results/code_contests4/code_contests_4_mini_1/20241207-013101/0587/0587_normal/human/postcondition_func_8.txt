The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `n` and `m`, and returns a list of `n` sublists, each containing `m` elements. Each element in these sublists will be `num`, which is unused and does not affect the output. However, since `num` is not utilized in creating the list, the function effectively returns a list of lists filled with `None` values if `m` is greater than 0, or an empty list if `m` is 0. If both `n` and `m` are 0, the function will return an empty list as well, leading to the conclusion that the output depends solely on the values of `n` and `m`.
