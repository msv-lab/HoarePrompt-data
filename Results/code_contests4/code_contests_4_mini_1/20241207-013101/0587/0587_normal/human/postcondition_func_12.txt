The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, and calculates the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements. It uses the formula factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)). If `r` is greater than `n`, the function will still attempt to compute the result, which may lead to incorrect calculations since factorial(n - r) would involve a negative number, resulting in a ValueError. Therefore, the function does not handle the case where `r` is greater than `n`, and as such, it may raise an error in that scenario.
