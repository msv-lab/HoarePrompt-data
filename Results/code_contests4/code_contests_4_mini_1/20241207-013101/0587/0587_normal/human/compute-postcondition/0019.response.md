The loop iterates over each element in `args`, writing each element's string representation to `file`. If it's not the first element, it prepends a separator `sep` before writing the next element. The variable `at_start` is set to False after the first iteration, ensuring the separator is only added before subsequent elements. 

Given that `args` is a non-empty iterable, the loop will execute a number of times equal to the length of `args`. After all iterations, `file` will contain the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, and `at_start` will be False.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`; `at_start` is False.**
