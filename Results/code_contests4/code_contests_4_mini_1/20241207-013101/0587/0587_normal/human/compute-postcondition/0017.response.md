The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The initial state indicates that `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file` has been updated to include the string representation of `x`. The variable `sep` remains unchanged, and if `at_start` is False, then `sep` has already been written to `file`.

Since `file` is being updated to include `str(x)`, this means that the content of `file` will now have `x` written to it in string format, but no other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` contains at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in `args`; `file` has been updated to include the string representation of `x`; `sep` remains unchanged; `file` now includes `str(x)`**.
