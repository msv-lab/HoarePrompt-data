The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `args`, `x`, and `file`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `x` is the first element in `args`; `file` now contains the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is False.
