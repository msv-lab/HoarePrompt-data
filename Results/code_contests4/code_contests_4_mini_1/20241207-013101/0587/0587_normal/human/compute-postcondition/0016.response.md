Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` contains at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in `args`; `file` has been updated to include the string representation of `x`; `sep` remains unchanged; if `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to `file`.***
