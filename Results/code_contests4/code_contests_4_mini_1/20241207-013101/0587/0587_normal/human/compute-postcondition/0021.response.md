Postcondition: ***The value associated with the key 'end' in `kwargs` is written to `file`, defaulting to a newline character if not present; `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `file` remains as before; `at_start` is False; the `flush` key in `kwargs` is present and its value is True.***
