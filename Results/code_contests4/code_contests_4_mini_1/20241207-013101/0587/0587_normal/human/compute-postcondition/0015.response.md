The `file.write(sep)` method writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The values of `n`, `m`, `args`, `x`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. Since the operation only affects the `file`, we note that `sep` is written to it but do not change any variable values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` contains at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in `args`; `file` has been updated to include the string representation of `x`; `sep` remains unchanged; `at_start` is False; `sep` is written to `file`.**
