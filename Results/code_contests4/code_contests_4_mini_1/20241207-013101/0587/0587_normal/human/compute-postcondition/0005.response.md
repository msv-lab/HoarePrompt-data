The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to a file referenced by `file`. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `args`, `x`, and `at_start` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `x` is the first element in `args`; `at_start` is false; and the value of `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `x` is the first element in `args`; `at_start` is false; the value of `sep` is written to the file.**
