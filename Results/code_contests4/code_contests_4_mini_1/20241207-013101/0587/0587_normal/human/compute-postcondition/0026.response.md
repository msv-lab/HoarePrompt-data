Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number greater than 1. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1) since these are not prime. It also returns False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For values of `n` greater than 3, it checks divisibility against potential prime factors of the form 6k Â± 1 up to the square root of `n`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not utilize the parameter `m`, which means any checks related to this parameter are not reflected in the functionality.**
