The provided code is a comment and does not affect the values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0.**
