The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `sep`, and `file`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is True.
