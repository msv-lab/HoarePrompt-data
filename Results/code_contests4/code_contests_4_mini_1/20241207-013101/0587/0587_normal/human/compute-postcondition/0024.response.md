The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It is defined without any input parameters. Based on the provided output conditions, the function's behavior is determined solely by the constraints that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 1,000,000 \) and \( n + m > 0 \). Since there is no specific output behavior described for the function, we cannot determine the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates based on the internal conditions of non-negative integers n and m, but the specific return value is not defined.**
