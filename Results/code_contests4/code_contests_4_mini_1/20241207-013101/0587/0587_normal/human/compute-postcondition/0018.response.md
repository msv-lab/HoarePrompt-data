The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `args`, `x`, `file`, and `sep`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 1,000,000 and `n` + `m` > 0; `args` contains at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in `args`; `file` has been updated to include the string representation of `x`; `sep` remains unchanged; `file` now includes `str(x)`; `at_start` is False.
