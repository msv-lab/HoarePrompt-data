The function does not take any parameters and returns a map object containing the integers parsed from the input string, which must consist of non-negative integers n and m such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. If the input does not satisfy these conditions, the behavior is not defined in the function, but it is expected that valid input will be provided.
