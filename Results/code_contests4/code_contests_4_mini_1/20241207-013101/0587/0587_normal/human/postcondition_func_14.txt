The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, along with a non-negative integer `p`. It computes the result of raising `x` to the power of `y` modulo `p` using an efficient method (exponentiation by squaring). The function returns the final computed value of `res`, which is influenced by the contributions of `x` during the iterations of the loop where `y` is odd. Edge cases include scenarios where `y` is initially zero, in which case it will return 1 (as any number to the power of 0 is 1), and the modulo operation ensures that `x` is within the bounds of `p`.
