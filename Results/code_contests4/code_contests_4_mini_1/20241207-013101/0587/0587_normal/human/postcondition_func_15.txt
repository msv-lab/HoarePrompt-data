The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, the function returns `x`. The GCD is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated modulo operations until `y` becomes 0. If both `x` and `y` are 0 (which is not allowed due to the precondition), this case is not handled explicitly in the code.
