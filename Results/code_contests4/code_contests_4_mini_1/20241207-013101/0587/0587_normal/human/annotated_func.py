    #The program returns an integer input from the user, which is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1,000,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input from the user. The input is expected to be a non-negative integer, but the code does not enforce the condition that it must be greater than 0. Therefore, the user could enter 0, which would violate the expected range of greater than 0, and the function does not handle this case. Additionally, while the annotations state that the input should be less than or equal to 1,000,000, the code does not perform any checks to ensure this constraint is met. Thus, the function essentially captures any integer input from the user without enforcing the specified constraints.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the value provided by the user through standard input. This input can be of any type, as it is directly obtained from the `input()` function, which captures user input as a string. There are no additional checks or validations on the input value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not take any parameters and returns a map object containing the integers parsed from the input string, which must consist of non-negative integers n and m such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. If the input does not satisfy these conditions, the behavior is not defined in the function, but it is expected that valid input will be provided.

    #The program returns a map object containing the string representations of the non-negative integers n and m, which are input as a space-separated string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user as a space-separated string representing two non-negative integers, n and m. It returns a map object containing the string representations of these integers. If the input is empty or does not contain two valid integers, it could lead to unexpected behavior, as there is no validation for input format or handling for cases where the input does not meet the specified conditions.

    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. It assumes that `func_3()` will return a valid list based on its internal logic, but further details on the behavior of `func_3()` are not provided. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to the execution of `func_3()`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function initializes a new thread that runs the `main` function. It has no direct parameters but operates under the assumption that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers within the specified limits before the function is called. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple containing two non-negative integers n and m such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1 000 000 and n + m > 0, where n is the number of students using two-block pieces and m is the number of students using three-block pieces.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the number of students using three-block pieces, which is the second element of the tuple 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `item` containing two non-negative integers, where the first integer represents the number of students using two-block pieces and the second integer represents the number of students using three-block pieces. It returns the second integer, which is the number of students using three-block pieces. There are no edge cases or additional logic present in the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list containing two non-negative integers n and m such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0, representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces respectively.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list 'l' sorted in descending order based on the key defined by the function 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `l` containing two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a specified key defined by the function `getKey`. The function does not handle cases where the list does not contain exactly two elements, nor does it verify that the elements meet the specified conditions (non-negativity and sum greater than zero).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0. num is an unused parameter that does not affect the output.

    #The program returns a list of lists with 'n' sublists, each containing 'm' elements, where each element is equal to 'num', which is an unused parameter
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `n` and `m`, and returns a list of `n` sublists, each containing `m` elements. Each element in these sublists will be `num`, which is unused and does not affect the output. However, since `num` is not utilized in creating the list, the function effectively returns a list of lists filled with `None` values if `m` is greater than 0, or an empty list if `m` is 0. If both `n` and `m` are 0, the function will return an empty list as well, leading to the conclusion that the output depends solely on the values of `n` and `m`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple of two non-negative integers (n, m) where n is the number of students using two-block pieces and m is the number of students using three-block pieces, with the constraints 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns the tuple x and the result of the expression 'not x & x - 1', which evaluates to a boolean indicating whether x is zero or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x` containing two non-negative integers (representing student counts) and returns a boolean indicating whether the tuple is non-empty and if the first element (treated as an integer) is a power of two. It does not return the tuple `x` as described in the annotations. The function's behavior is dependent on the boolean evaluation of `x` and checks if `x` evaluates to a power of two, which means the function will return `True` if `x` is a power of two and `False` otherwise, unless `x` is empty, in which case it returns `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of students using two-block pieces, and m is a non-negative integer representing the number of students using three-block pieces such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of the non-negative integer n, with the '0b' prefix removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. It correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, returning '0' as the binary representation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of students using two-block pieces, and m is a non-negative integer representing the number of students using three-block pieces such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1,000,000 and n + m > 0.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of the digits of the non-negative integer n, which represents the number of students using two-block pieces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of its digits as integers. It handles all non-negative integers, including zero, by converting the integer to a string and then transforming each character back into an integer in the resulting list. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in this implementation.

def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
    #The program returns the result of the binomial coefficient calculation factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)), where n and m are non-negative integers and n + m > 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, and calculates the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements. It uses the formula factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)). If `r` is greater than `n`, the function will still attempt to compute the result, which may lead to incorrect calculations since factorial(n - r) would involve a negative number, resulting in a ValueError. Therefore, the function does not handle the case where `r` is greater than `n`, and as such, it may raise an error in that scenario.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces respectively, such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1,000,000 and x + y > 0.

    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer division of x by y plus 1, where x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer not equal to 0, and x is not divisible by y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where `y` must be greater than 0. It returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. It does not handle the case where `y` is 0, which would lead to a division by zero error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer representing the number of students using two-block pieces, y is a non-negative integer representing the number of students using three-block pieces, and it is guaranteed that at least one of x or y is greater than 0.

    return res
    #The program returns the value of 'res', which is updated based on the contributions of 'x' during the iterations when 'y' was odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, along with a non-negative integer `p`. It computes the result of raising `x` to the power of `y` modulo `p` using an efficient method (exponentiation by squaring). The function returns the final computed value of `res`, which is influenced by the contributions of `x` during the iterations of the loop where `y` is odd. Edge cases include scenarios where `y` is initially zero, in which case it will return 1 (as any number to the power of 0 is 1), and the modulo operation ensures that `x` is within the bounds of `p`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively, such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1,000,000 and x + y > 0.

    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`, which is `x` since `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, the function returns `x`. The GCD is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeated modulo operations until `y` becomes 0. If both `x` and `y` are 0 (which is not allowed due to the precondition), this case is not handled explicitly in the code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number greater than 1. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if `n` is less than or equal to 3 (but greater than 1) since these are not prime. It also returns False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For values of `n` greater than 3, it checks divisibility against potential prime factors of the form 6k ± 1 up to the square root of `n`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not utilize the parameter `m`, which means any checks related to this parameter are not reflected in the functionality.

If such an `i` is found, the loop breaks; otherwise, it continues until `i` reaches 1,000,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, both within the range of 0 to 1,000,000, and with the condition that their sum is greater than 0.
