The function accepts input from the user as a space-separated string representing two non-negative integers, n and m. It returns a map object containing the string representations of these integers. If the input is empty or does not contain two valid integers, it could lead to unexpected behavior, as there is no validation for input format or handling for cases where the input does not meet the specified conditions.
