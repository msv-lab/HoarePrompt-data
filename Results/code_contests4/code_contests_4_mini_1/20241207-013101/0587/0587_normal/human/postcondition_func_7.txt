The function accepts a list `l` containing two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a specified key defined by the function `getKey`. The function does not handle cases where the list does not contain exactly two elements, nor does it verify that the elements meet the specified conditions (non-negativity and sum greater than zero).
