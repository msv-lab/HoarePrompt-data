The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where `y` must be greater than 0. It returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. It does not handle the case where `y` is 0, which would lead to a division by zero error.
