To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

**Problem Description Recap:**
The task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three faces that share a common vertex. 

**Program Analysis:**
```python
(a, b, c) = map(float, raw_input().split())
x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5
y = (b / c * a) ** 0.5
z = (c / a * b) ** 0.5
print(4 * (x + y + z))
```

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three space-separated integers representing the areas of the faces. However, it uses `raw_input()` and `map(float, ...)`. This is a potential issue because areas are guaranteed to be integers, and converting them to floats may introduce unnecessary complications.

2. **Calculating Dimensions:**
   - The calculations for `x`, `y`, and `z` are derived from the areas `a`, `b`, and `c`. The formulas used are based on the relationships between the areas and dimensions of the parallelepiped. 
   - The equations assume:
     - \( x = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b} \cdot c} \)
     - \( y = \sqrt{\frac{b}{c} \cdot a} \)
     - \( z = \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot b} \)

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The output is calculated as \( 4 \times (x + y + z) \). This is correct, as the sum of the lengths of all edges of a rectangular parallelepiped is \( 4 \times (x + y + z) \).

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The calculated dimensions \( x, y, z \) must yield valid non-negative integers since they represent the lengths of the edges of the parallelepiped. 
   - Given that the input areas are integers, the expressions for \( x, y, z \) may not yield integer results. This can lead to potential inaccuracies in edge lengths if the calculated values are not integers, which are needed for the edge lengths.

5. **Example Case Testing:**
   - For the input `4 6 6`, the calculated dimensions would be:
     - \( x = \sqrt{4/6 \cdot 6} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \)
     - \( y = \sqrt{6/6 \cdot 4} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \)
     - \( z = \sqrt{6/4 \cdot 6} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \)
   - The output would then be \( 4 \times (2 + 2 + 3) = 28 \), which is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - However, when testing an input such as `1 1 1`, the output would still be correct because \( x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 \) leads to \( 12 \) edges in total.
   - The program fails to ensure that the derived values for \( x, y, z \) are integers and may lead to incorrect interpretations of edge lengths in scenarios where the areas are not conducive to producing integer results for dimensions.

Given the analysis above, the program does not adhere to the expectations set forth in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
