Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly processes the input areas of the parallelepiped's faces and does not accurately calculate the dimensions of the parallelepiped based on those areas. 

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program uses `raw_input()` which is not appropriate in Python 3; instead, it should use `input()`.
   - Additionally, the program maps the input values to `float` instead of `int`, even though the problem description specifies that the edge lengths are integers.

2. **Calculation of Dimensions**:
   - The formulas used to calculate `x`, `y`, and `z` (the dimensions of the parallelepiped) are incorrect. The program attempts to derive the dimensions using the areas of the faces, but the calculations do not produce the correct dimensions based on the given face areas.
   - The correct relationships between the areas and the dimensions (lengths of the edges) are not utilized. For a rectangular parallelepiped with edges `x`, `y`, and `z`, the areas of the faces are:
     - Area1 = x * y
     - Area2 = y * z
     - Area3 = z * x
   - These relations can be used to derive `x`, `y`, and `z` correctly:
     - \( x = \sqrt{\frac{Area1 \cdot Area3}{Area2}} \)
     - \( y = \sqrt{\frac{Area1 \cdot Area2}{Area3}} \)
     - \( z = \sqrt{\frac{Area2 \cdot Area3}{Area1}} \)

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program computes the output as `4 * (x + y + z)` which is correct in terms of calculating the sum of all edges, but since `x`, `y`, and `z` are not calculated correctly, the output will also be incorrect.

Due to these issues, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
