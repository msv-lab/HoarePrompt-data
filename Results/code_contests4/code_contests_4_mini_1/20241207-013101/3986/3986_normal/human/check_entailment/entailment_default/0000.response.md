The program aims to calculate the sum of the lengths of all edges of a rectangular parallelepiped given the areas of its three orthogonal faces. The areas are represented by three positive floating-point numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

### Assessment of the Code:
1. The code calculates the lengths `x`, `y`, and `z` of the edges using the formulas derived from the given areas:
   - \( x = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b} \cdot c} \)
   - \( y = \sqrt{\frac{b}{c} \cdot a} \)
   - \( z = \sqrt{\frac{c}{a} \cdot b} \)
   - Finally, it prints \( 4 \times (x + y + z) \), which is the total length of the edges calculated correctly based on the derived lengths.

2. However, the program uses `float` for input but the problem description specifies that the inputs are integers. This could lead to inaccuracies in the calculations due to floating-point imprecision. 

3. The program does not check or validate the input, so if invalid input were provided (though the problem guarantees valid input), it would not handle it gracefully.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints suggest that the function is intended to calculate the semi-axes lengths based on the areas and print four times their sum. This matches the operation performed in the code, but the hints do not address the potential issue of input type (float vs. integer) and its implications on accuracy.

### Edge Cases:
An edge case to consider is when the areas are such that they yield very small or very large dimensions, leading to potential floating-point inaccuracies. For example, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are very large, the calculations for `x`, `y`, and `z` might lead to overflow or precision loss.

Given the requirement that the program must meet all potential cases exactly as described, and considering the input type mismatch and the lack of input validation, the program does not follow the problem description accurately in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
