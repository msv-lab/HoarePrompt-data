Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description specifies that the input consists of three space-separated integers representing the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. However, the program uses `map(float, raw_input().split())`, which reads the input as floating-point numbers. The areas must be treated as integers since they are defined as positive integers in the problem description.

2. **Mathematical Calculations**: The calculations for `x`, `y`, and `z` appear to be incorrect. The logic for obtaining the edge lengths from the areas is not explicitly derived from the relationship between the areas and the dimensions of the parallelepiped. The areas of the three faces are given as `A1 = xy`, `A2 = xz`, and `A3 = yz`. The correct calculations for the edge lengths based on the areas should involve solving the equations derived from these areas, but the formulas used in the program do not reflect this.

3. **Output**: While the output is supposed to be the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped, the program incorrectly computes `4 * (x + y + z)`. The correct total edge length should be `4 * (x + y + z)` if `x`, `y`, and `z` were correctly calculated, but because the calculations are incorrect, the output is also incorrect.

In summary, due to the improper input handling and incorrect calculations for edge lengths, the program does not meet the specifications of the problem description.
