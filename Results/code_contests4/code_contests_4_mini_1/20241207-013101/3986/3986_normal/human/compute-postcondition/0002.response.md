The value of `y` is assigned the result of the expression `(b / c * a) ** 0.5`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive float values from the input, and `x` is already assigned the value `(a / b * c)`. The calculation for `y` depends on the existing values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but since those values are unspecified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result for `y`. The output state reflects that `y` is derived from the given formula.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are the three positive float values from the input; `x` is assigned the value `(a / b * c)`; `y` is assigned the value `(b / c * a) ** 0.5**.**
