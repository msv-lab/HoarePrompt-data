The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes three positive integers representing the areas of the parallelepiped's faces, where each area is greater than 0 and does not exceed 10,000. After executing the function body, it returns the volume of the parallelepiped if the areas correspond to valid face combinations. If the face areas do not correspond to a valid parallelepiped, the function may return an error message or a specific indication of invalid input. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to determine the volume of a parallelepiped based on the given areas of its faces while ensuring the areas provided are valid. 

Functionality: **The function processes three positive integers representing areas of a parallelepiped's faces and returns its volume if the areas are valid; otherwise, it indicates invalid input.**
