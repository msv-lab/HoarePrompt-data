Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive floating-point numbers representing the areas of a parallelepiped's faces, calculates the semi-axes lengths (x, y, z) based on the provided areas, and prints four times the sum of these lengths. It does not return any value and does not handle invalid input or check if the areas are valid for forming a parallelepiped. **
