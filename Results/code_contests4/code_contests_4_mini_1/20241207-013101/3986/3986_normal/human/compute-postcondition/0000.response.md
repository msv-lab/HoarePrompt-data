The code assigns the values from the input to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` after converting them to floats. The input consists of three positive integers representing the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. Since the areas are positive integers, they will be converted to floating-point numbers but maintain their value. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are the three positive float values from the input.**
