To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem states that we have a rectangular parallelepiped with three areas of its faces given. The goal is to find the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped.

From the input areas \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the dimensions of the parallelepiped can be derived as follows:

1. Let the lengths of the edges be \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
2. The areas of the faces that share a vertex can be expressed as:
   - \(xy = a\)
   - \(yz = b\)
   - \(zx = c\)

To find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), we can derive their values as follows:

\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot c}{b}}, \quad y = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot b}{c}}, \quad z = \sqrt{\frac{b \cdot c}{a}}
\]

The sum of all edges of the parallelepiped is given by:

\[
\text{Sum of edges} = 4(x + y + z)
\]

Now, let's examine the provided program:

```python
(a, b, c) = map(float, raw_input().split())
x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5
y = (b / c * a) ** 0.5
z = (c / a * b) ** 0.5
print(4 * (x + y + z))
```

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Assignment of Edge Lengths**: 
   - The formulas used in the program to calculate \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are incorrect. They do not correspond to the correct derivation from the areas of the faces. The correct calculations should be:
     - \(x = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot c}{b}}\)
     - \(y = \sqrt{\frac{a \cdot b}{c}}\)
     - \(z = \sqrt{\frac{b \cdot c}{a}}\)
   - The current implementation uses the incorrect formulas which do not yield the correct edge lengths.

2. **Potential Case of Incorrect Output**:
   - For example, if we take the areas \(a = 4\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 6\):
     - Using the correct formulas, we should get:
       - \(x = \sqrt{\frac{4 \cdot 6}{6}} = 2\)
       - \(y = \sqrt{\frac{4 \cdot 6}{6}} = 2\)
       - \(z = \sqrt{\frac{6 \cdot 6}{4}} = 3\)
       - Thus, the sum would be \(4(2 + 2 + 3) = 28\).
     - However, the program's calculations will yield incorrect values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), leading to an incorrect output.

Given these observations, the program fails to execute the correct logic as per the problem description for at least one input case.

Correctness: **False**
