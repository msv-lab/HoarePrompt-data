You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given N items.
The value of the i-th item (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.
Your have to select at least A and at most B of these items.
Under this condition, find the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items.
Additionally, find the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* 1 \leq A,B \leq N
* 1 \leq v_i \leq 10^{15}
* Each v_i is an integer.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N A B
v_1
v_2
...
v_N


Output

Print two lines.
The first line should contain the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items. The output should be considered correct if the absolute or relative error is at most 10^{-6}.
The second line should contain the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized.

Program:
```
(N, A, B) = map(int, raw_input().split())
v = map(int, raw_input().split())
resultValue = 0
resultCount = 0
for pcs in range(B - A + 1):
    perm = list(itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs))
    for cand in perm:
        average = float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)
        if resultValue < average:
            resultValue = average
            resultCount = 1
        elif resultValue == average:
            resultCount += 1
print(resultValue)
print(resultCount)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
