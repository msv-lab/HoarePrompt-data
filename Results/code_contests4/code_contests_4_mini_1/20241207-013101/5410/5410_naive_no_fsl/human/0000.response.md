Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described.

1. **Combination Logic**: The program uses `itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs)` to generate combinations of items. However, it does not correctly enforce the selection limits of `A` to `B`. The correct range for combinations should be from `A` to `B`, but the current implementation's loop iterates from `0` to `B - A`, which incorrectly increases the number of items chosen beyond the specified limits.

2. **Counting Combinations**: The counting of combinations resulting in the maximum mean is flawed. The program counts combinations of size `B + pcs`, but it should be counting combinations of size `k` for `k` in the range `[A, B]`. This means it may not count all valid combinations that provide the maximum mean.

3. **Efficient Handling of Input Size**: Given the constraints (with `N` being up to 50), the program can potentially generate a large number of combinations, which may lead to inefficiency and incorrect results if it does not properly manage the combination sizes.

4. **Mean Calculation**: The mean is calculated as `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`, but since the program does not restrict the combinations to the correct size, it may lead to incorrect averages being considered.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5 2 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is:
```
4.500000
1
```
The correct combinations for maximum mean within the range of selecting 2 to 3 items would be:
- For 2 items: (4, 5) => mean = 4.5
- For 3 items: (3, 4, 5) => mean = 4.0

Thus, the only combination that gives a mean of 4.5 is (4, 5), which should yield a count of 1. However, due to the issues in the code, it may not correctly identify and count these combinations.

These points undermine the correctness of the program, leading to the conclusion that it does not fully adhere to the problem's requirements.
