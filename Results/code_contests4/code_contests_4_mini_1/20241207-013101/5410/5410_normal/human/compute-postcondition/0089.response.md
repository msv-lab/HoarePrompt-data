Functionality: ** The function accepts input values for N, A, B, and a list of integers v. It calculates the maximum average of all combinations of elements from v taken B + pcs at a time, where pcs varies from 0 to B - A. It then counts how many combinations yield this maximum average. The function outputs the maximum average and the count of combinations that achieve this average. However, it does not handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified constraints, nor does it validate the input.**
