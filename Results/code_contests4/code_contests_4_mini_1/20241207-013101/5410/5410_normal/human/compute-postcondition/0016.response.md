According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `perm` list. The loop iterates over each element in `perm`, and since `cand` is currently set to the first element of `perm`, we need to determine how many elements are in `perm` to understand how many iterations can occur.

At the end of the last iteration, `cand` is the first element of `perm`, and since `perm` is a non-empty list, it contains at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `cand` must be set to the next element in `perm`. 

If `perm` contains `k` elements, the loop will execute `k` times, and assuming `cand` is currently the first element, for the loop to execute again, `cand` needs to be the second element of `perm`. Therefore, after the next iteration, `cand` will be updated to the second element of `perm`, and for the loop to continue executing, `perm` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `B` is greater than or equal to `A`; `pcs` is 0; `perm` is a non-empty list of combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time; `cand` is the second element of `perm`, for the loop to execute a second time `perm` must have at least 2 elements.**
