According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `perm`. For the loop to execute at least once, `perm` must contain at least one combination. Given that `perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + pcs` at a time, we need to ensure that this list is not empty. 

Since `pcs` is 0, the number of elements taken from `v` should be `B`. For the loop to have at least one candidate (i.e., for `perm` to be non-empty), the number of combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time must be greater than 0. This can happen if `B` is less than or equal to the total number of elements in `v`.

Assuming that `v` has enough elements (at least `B`), we can adjust the states as follows:

- `perm` should be a non-empty list, which means that the combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time must yield at least one combination.
- `cand` will take the first element of `perm` during the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we must ensure `perm` is non-empty and `cand` is the first element of `perm`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `B` is greater than or equal to `A`; `pcs` is 0; `perm` is a non-empty list of combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time; `cand` is the first element of `perm`**
