Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `B` is greater than or equal to `A`; `pcs` is 0; `perm` is a non-empty list of combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time; `cand` is the first element of `perm`; `average` is calculated as float(sum(cand)) / len(cand); if `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultCount` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1; if `resultValue` is greater than `average`, `resultCount` remains unchanged.***
