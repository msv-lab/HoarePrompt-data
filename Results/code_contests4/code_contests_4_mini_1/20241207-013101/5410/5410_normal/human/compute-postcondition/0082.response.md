Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 3, `perm` has at least 3 elements, and `cand` is the next candidate in the list. If `resultValue` equals `average`, then the maximum average condition holds true; otherwise, no else part is defined.***
