The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on certain constraints related to external inputs. The constraints specify that `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and both `A` and `B` are integers constrained between 1 and `N`. Additionally, there is a collection of integers `v_i`, where each integer is within the range from 1 to 10^15 for indices ranging from 1 to `N`.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, without further details on the processing or the expected return value, the specific output cannot be determined.

Functionality: **The function does not take parameters directly but operates based on the constraints of N (1 <= N <= 50), A and B (1 <= A, B <= N), and a list of integers v_i (1 <= v_i <= 10^15). The return value is not specified.**
