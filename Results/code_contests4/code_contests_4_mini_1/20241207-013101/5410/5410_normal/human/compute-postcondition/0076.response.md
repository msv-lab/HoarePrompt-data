Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 2. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is equal to `average`, and `resultCount` is 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` equals `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
