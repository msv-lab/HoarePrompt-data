The variable `resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact new value. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.
