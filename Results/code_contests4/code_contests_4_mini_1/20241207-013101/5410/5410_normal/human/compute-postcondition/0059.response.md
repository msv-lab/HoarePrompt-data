Output State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is the count of combinations that yield the `resultValue`, `perm` is a list of combinations of `v` taken `B + pcs` at a time, for the loop to execute a second time `A` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `pcs` is `B - A + 1; `perm` is now populated with combinations of `v` based on the given parameters.**
