To calculate the `average`, the code computes the sum of the elements in the list `cand` and divides it by the number of elements in `cand`. 

The values of `N`, `A`, and `B` are not directly affected by this operation. However, `cand`, which is the first combination in `perm`, influences the output. Given that `cand` is a list of integers, the `sum(cand)` will yield the total sum of the integers in `cand`, and `len(cand)` will provide the count of those integers.

The output state reflects the computation of `average`, which is derived from the values in `cand`.

Output State: **`average` is float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)**
