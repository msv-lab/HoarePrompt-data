Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `B` is greater than or equal to `A`; `resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations of `v` taken `B + pcs` at a time for `pcs` in the range from 0 to `B - A`; `resultCount` is the count of combinations that yield the `resultValue`; and the value of `resultCount` is printed.**
