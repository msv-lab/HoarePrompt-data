Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 1 if `resultValue` is less than `average`, otherwise `resultCount` is at least 3. `perm` must have at least 3 elements, `cand` is the next candidate in the list, and if `resultValue` equals `average`, then the maximum average condition holds true; otherwise, the maximum average condition does not hold.***
