Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `perm` is populated with combinations of `v`, `average` is the float division of the sum of `cand` by the length of `cand`, and `resultValue` is less than `average`.***
