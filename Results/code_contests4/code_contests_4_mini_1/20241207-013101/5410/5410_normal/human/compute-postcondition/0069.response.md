Postcondition: ***`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, and `resultCount` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. If `resultValue` was less than `average`, it is now equal to `average` and `resultCount` is 1. If `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, then `perm` is populated with combinations of `v`, `average` is the float division of the sum of `cand` by the length of `cand`, and if `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
