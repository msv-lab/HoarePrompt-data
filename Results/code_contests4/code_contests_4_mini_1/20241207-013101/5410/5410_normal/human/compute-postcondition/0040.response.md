The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `resultCount` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is a float calculated as the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultValue` is equal to `average`, and `resultCount` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`average` is a float calculated as the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultValue` is equal to `average`, and `resultCount` is increased by 1.**
