According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `perm` iterable. If `perm` has at least one more element, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cand` is the last element in `perm`, and the loop has processed all previous elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `perm` must have at least one more element available for `cand`.

State: **`average` is a float calculated as the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, for the loop to execute one more time `perm` must have at least one more element, and `cand` will be the next element in `perm`.**
