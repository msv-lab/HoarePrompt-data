According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `perm`. If `perm` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 2. The loop processes each candidate in `perm`, so for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next candidate in `perm`.

Since `resultCount` is at least 2, the loop has already executed at least twice. We need to ensure that `cand` refers to the next candidate in the list, which would be the next element in `perm`. Assuming `perm` has more elements, the `cand` will represent the next candidate.

Therefore, if `perm` has at least 3 elements, and since `cand` is currently the last processed candidate, it must be increased by 1 to represent the next candidate.

State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `perm` must have at least 3 elements, `cand` is the next candidate in the list**
