The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 50; `A` and `B` are integers such that 1 <= `A`, `B` <= `N`; `B` is greater than or equal to `A`; `pcs` is 0; `perm` is a non-empty list of combinations of `v` taken `B` at a time with at least 3 combinations; `cand` is the third element of `perm`; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.
