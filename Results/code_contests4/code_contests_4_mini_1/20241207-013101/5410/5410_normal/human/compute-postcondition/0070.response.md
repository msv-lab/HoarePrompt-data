According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `perm`. If `perm` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `resultValue` is either equal to `average` with `resultCount` increased by 1, or `resultValue` is less than `average`, which means `resultValue` is now equal to `average` and `resultCount` is 1. 

Since `resultCount` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, it means that `resultValue` must have been equal to `average` in the previous iteration and subsequently increased `resultCount`, allowing it to be at least 2. The loop can continue as long as there are more elements in `perm` to iterate over.

If `perm` originally had at least 2 elements and `cand` is the next element to be processed, the next value of `cand` will be from the next position in `perm`. 

State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `cand` is the next element in `perm`.**
