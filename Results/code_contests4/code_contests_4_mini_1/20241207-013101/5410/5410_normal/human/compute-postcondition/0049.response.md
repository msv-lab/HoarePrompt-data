Postcondition: ***`average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
