The value of `resultCount` is assigned to 1. This means that the previous value of `resultCount`, which was at least 2, is now changed to 1. This assignment affects the ability of the loop to execute a second time because the loop requires `resultCount` to be at least 2 for that to happen. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is 1, and `average` is calculated as `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`.

Output State: **`resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is 1, and `average` is calculated as `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`**.
