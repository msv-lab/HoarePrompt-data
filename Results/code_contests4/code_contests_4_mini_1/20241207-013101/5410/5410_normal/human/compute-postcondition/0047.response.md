The value of `resultCount` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so the output state reflects that the variable has increased. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultCount` is increased by 1**
