Postcondition: ***`average` is a float calculated as the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is equal to `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. If `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, and if `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
