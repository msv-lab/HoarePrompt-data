The variable `average` is assigned the value of `float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)`. This calculation requires `cand` to be a list of numbers, and it computes the average of the elements in `cand`. The initial state indicates that `resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, but this calculation does not affect `resultValue`. The only new variable being introduced is `average`, which holds the computed average value based on the sum of `cand` divided by its length.

Output State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average of all combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` is at least 2, `perm` must have at least 3 elements, `cand` is the next candidate in the list; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`.**
