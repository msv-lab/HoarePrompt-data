The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of `average` and `resultValue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, `resultValue` is assigned that same value, and `resultCount` is 1.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, `resultValue` is assigned that same value, and `resultCount` is 1.**
