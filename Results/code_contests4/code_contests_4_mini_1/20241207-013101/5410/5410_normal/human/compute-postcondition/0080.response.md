The value of `resultCount` is assigned 1. This directly affects `resultCount`, which is changed from at least 2 to exactly 1. The other variables (`resultValue`, `perm`, `cand`, and `average`) remain unaffected in this context. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is now assigned the value of `average`, `resultCount` is 1, `perm` must have at least 3 elements, `cand` is the next candidate in the list; `average` is the float value of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`.
