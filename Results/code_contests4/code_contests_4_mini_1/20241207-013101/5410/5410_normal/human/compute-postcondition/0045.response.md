The variable `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`. Since `average` is already calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, the value of `resultValue` will be equal to that of `average`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, and `resultValue` is assigned that same value.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`, `resultValue` is assigned that same value.**
