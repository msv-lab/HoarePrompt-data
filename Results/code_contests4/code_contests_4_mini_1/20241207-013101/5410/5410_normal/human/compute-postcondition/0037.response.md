`resultCount` is assigned the value of 1. The previous values of `average` and `resultValue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is a float calculated as the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is equal to `average`; `resultCount` is 1.

Output State: **`average` is a float calculated as the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is equal to `average`; `resultCount` is 1**
