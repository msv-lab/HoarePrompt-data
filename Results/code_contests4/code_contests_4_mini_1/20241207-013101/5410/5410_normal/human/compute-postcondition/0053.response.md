The variable `resultCount` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of `average` and `resultValue` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1.

Output State: **`average` is calculated as the float of the sum of `cand` divided by the length of `cand`; `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`; `resultCount` is 1**.
