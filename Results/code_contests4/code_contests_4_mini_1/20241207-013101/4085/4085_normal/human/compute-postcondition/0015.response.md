Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9; `sep` is the value from `kwargs`; if `at_start` is False, `file` writes `sep`, the string representation of `x` (the third element of `args`), and then writes `sep` again.***
