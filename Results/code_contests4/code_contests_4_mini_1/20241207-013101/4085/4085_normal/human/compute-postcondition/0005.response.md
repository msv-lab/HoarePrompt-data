Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9, `sep` is assigned the value from `kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), `file` is assigned the value from `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element of `args`. Consequently, `file` writes `sep` if `at_start` is not True.***
