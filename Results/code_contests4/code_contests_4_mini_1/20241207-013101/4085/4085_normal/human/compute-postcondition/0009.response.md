The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The previous states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9, `sep` is the value from `kwargs`, `file` writes `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element of `args`.**
