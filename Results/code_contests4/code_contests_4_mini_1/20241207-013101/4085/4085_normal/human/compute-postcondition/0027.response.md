The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `N` and `A`. The parameter `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5. The parameter `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^9. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so based on the constraints and relationships, we can only describe the inputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `N` and a list of integers `A`, where `N` indicates the number of integers in the list, and each integer in the list is constrained by the specified limits.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (2 <= N <= 10^5) and a list A of N integers (1 <= A_i <= 10^9).**
