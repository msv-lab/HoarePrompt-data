Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9; `sep` is the value from `kwargs`; `file` writes `sep`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element of `args`; `file` writes the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is set to False.**
