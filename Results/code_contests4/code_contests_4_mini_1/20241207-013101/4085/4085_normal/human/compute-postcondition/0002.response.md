According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `args` variable. For the loop to execute, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. The state variables provided (`N`, `A`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start`) do not influence the execution of the loop directly, but they are part of the program's context. 

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we must ensure that `args` contains at least one element. Additionally, since `x` will take on the values from `args`, we need to account for the first value of `args` during the first iteration. 

Hence, for the loop to execute:
- `args` must be a non-empty iterable, and 
- `x` will be assigned the first element of `args` during the first iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9, `sep` is assigned the value from `kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), `file` is assigned the value from `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` must be a non-empty iterable and `x` is the first element of `args`.**
