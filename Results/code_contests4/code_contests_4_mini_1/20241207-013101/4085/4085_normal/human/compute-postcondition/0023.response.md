The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `N`, which is an integer that satisfies the constraint \(2 \leq N \leq 100000\). It also accepts a parameter `A`, which is a list of integers where each integer \(A_i\) satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\). 

The function's output is determined as follows:
- Case 1: If conditions related to the elements of the list `A` are met, the function returns a specific value or result based on that condition.
- Case 2: If a different condition related to `N` or `A` is met, the function returns another value or result.

However, since the specific conditions and return values are not detailed, we can summarize that the function processes the list `A` and the integer `N` to produce a result based on certain criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (2 <= N <= 100000) and a list A of N integers (1 <= A_i <= 10^9), and returns a value based on the processing of these inputs according to certain conditions.**
