Output State: **`res` is the maximum GCD of `gcd_arr[i]` and `gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `gcd_arr` is a list of size `n + 1` containing GCD values; `gcd_arr_rev` is a list of size `n + 1` containing GCD values; `n` is the total number of elements in `a`, and the function `func_2` is called with `res`.**
