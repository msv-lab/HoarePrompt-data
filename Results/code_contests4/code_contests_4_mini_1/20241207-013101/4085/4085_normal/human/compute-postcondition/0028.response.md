Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (where 2 <= N <= 10^5) and a list `A` of `N` integers (where 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9). It calculates the maximum GCD between elements of the list when one element is excluded. The GCD is computed using two auxiliary arrays that store GCD values from the start and the end of the list, respectively. Finally, it passes the result to another function `func_2`. **
