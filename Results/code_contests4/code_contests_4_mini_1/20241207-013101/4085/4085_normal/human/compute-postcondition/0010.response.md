Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` satisfies 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^9, `sep` is the value from `kwargs`, `file` writes `sep`, and `at_start` remains False. The `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element of `args`.***
