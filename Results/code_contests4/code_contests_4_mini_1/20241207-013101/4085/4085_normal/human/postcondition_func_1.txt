The function accepts a variable number of arguments and optional keyword arguments for formatting output. It writes each argument as a string to a specified output file, separating them with a specified separator, and appends an optional end character. If the flush keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the output file. The function does not explicitly handle the case where no arguments are provided, which could lead to no output being written to the file. Additionally, the function does not utilize the parameters N and A mentioned in the annotations, making those annotations misleading.
