To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem statement and the code implementation.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
1. We are given N integers.
2. We can replace one of those integers with any integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
3. We need to find the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers after making one replacement.

### Code Analysis:
1. The code reads the integers and sorts them.
2. It computes two arrays of GCDs:
   - `gcd_arr[i]` which holds the GCD of the first `i` elements.
   - `gcd_arr_rev[i]` which holds the GCD of the elements from `i` to the end.
3. The program calculates the maximum GCD that can be achieved by replacing one integer by iterating through the array and computing the GCD of the GCDs before and after the current index.
4. Finally, it outputs the result.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic of the program seems correct for calculating the GCDs of the remaining integers when one integer is replaced. However, it does not seem to handle the case where replacing an integer can lead to a GCD that is higher than the current GCD of the remaining integers.
- Specifically, if we replace any integer with a number that is the GCD of the remaining numbers, it could potentially lead to a higher GCD.

### Example Case to Consider:
For the input:
```
3
3 6 9
```
- The GCD of the array is 3. If we replace `3` with `6`, the GCD of the array becomes `6`, which is higher than the previous GCD of `3`. The current implementation may not capture this logic correctly since it primarily focuses on the GCD calculations without considering the optimal replacement scenario that maximizes GCD.

### Conclusion:
Due to the potential loss of maximizing the GCD in cases like the one described above, the program does not account for all possibilities of achieving the maximum GCD when one integer is replaced. Therefore, the solution fails for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
