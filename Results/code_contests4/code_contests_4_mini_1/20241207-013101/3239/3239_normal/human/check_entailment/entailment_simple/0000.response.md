To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the key requirements and see if the program fulfills them.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: The program should accept multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of composite integers.
2. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output:
   - The number of colors used (m ≤ 11).
   - A list of colors assigned to each composite integer.
3. **Coloring Constraints**:
   - Each color must be represented at least once.
   - Any two integers of the same color must have a GCD greater than 1.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the composite integers correctly using functions like `func_1()` and `func_4()`.
   
2. **Logic for Coloring**:
   - The program uses divisibility rules to assign colors based on prime factors (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.). 
   - This approach ensures that all integers sharing a common prime factor will have a GCD greater than 1, satisfying the coloring constraints.
   - It uses arrays `f` and `g` to track the count of occurrences and the last unique integer assigned to each prime factor, respectively.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the number of colors used and the corresponding coloring for each test case, which is an essential requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program uses a systematic approach to ensure that:
- Each color is represented.
- Elements of the same color share a common prime factor, ensuring their GCD is greater than 1.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases well, as it can assign multiple colors based on different prime factors.
- Given that all composite integers fall within the specified range (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), the logic of using prime factors is effective.

### Summary:
The program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description. It effectively handles the input, applies the coloring criteria, and formats the output correctly. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
