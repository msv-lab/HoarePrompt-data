The function accepts a positive integer `x` representing the number of test cases and a list `y` that contains tuples, where each tuple consists of a positive integer followed by a list of composite integers. The function effectively returns the last non-empty tuple from the list `y`, but it does this using an incorrect approach since the loop does not operate as intended with tuples and will not yield the expected result. Instead, it will result in an error due to the operation on an integer and a tuple, indicating a potential bug in the implementation.
