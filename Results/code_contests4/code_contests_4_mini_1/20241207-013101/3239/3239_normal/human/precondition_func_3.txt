The function does not take any input parameters. It is assumed to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by a sequence of n composite integers a_i (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The total number of integers across all test cases does not exceed 10,000.
