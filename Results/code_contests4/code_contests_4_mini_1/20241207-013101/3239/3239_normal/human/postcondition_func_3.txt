The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by `func_3()`, which processes multiple test cases of composite integers, with the integers constrained to be between 4 and 1000 and the total number of integers across all test cases not exceeding 10,000. However, since `func_3()` is not defined within the provided code, the exact nature of the list returned by `func_4()` cannot be determined from the information given.
