Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, satisfies all divisibility conditions, and is divisible by 23. If `f[9]` is true, then `l` contains the value of `g[9]` appended to it. If `f[9]` is false, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to `l`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
