Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `l`, and `g[1]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is odd, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f[2]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 3 but divisible by 5, `f[3]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 5 but divisible by 7, `f[4]` is increased by 1, with `l` and `g[4]` unchanged; if not divisible by 7 but divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 11 but divisible by 13, `f[6]` is updated to true (or incremented by 1), with `l` and `g[6]` unchanged; if not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1, leaving `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` unchanged; if not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `g[10]`, and `l` remain unchanged; if not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, there are no changes made to `f[11]`.***
