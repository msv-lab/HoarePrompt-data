The value of `j` is already increased by 1. The operation `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since the previous value of `j` is unknown, we cannot specify the exact value appended to `l`. However, we can state that `j` is added to `l`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now includes the current value of `j`.**
