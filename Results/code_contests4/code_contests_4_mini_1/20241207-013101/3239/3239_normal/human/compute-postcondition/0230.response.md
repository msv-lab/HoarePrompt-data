The statement `f[4] += 1` increments the value of `f[4]` by 1. The previous value of `f[4]` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The values of other variables (`l`, `j`, `g[4]`, etc.) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `f[4]` is now incremented by 1.
