The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, but the previous value of `j` (which was increased by 1) is not specified. Therefore, `l` will have the updated value of `j`, but we cannot determine the exact value without knowing the original value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1; `j` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1; `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
