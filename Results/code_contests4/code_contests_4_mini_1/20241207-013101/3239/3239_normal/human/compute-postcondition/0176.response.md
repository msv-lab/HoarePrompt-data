Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [0, 0] (if `f[8]` is true) or [0, 1] (if `f[8]` is false), `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], `g` is a list of twelve 0's (if `f[8]` is true) or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] (if `f[8]` is false), `j` remains 1 (if `f[8]` is true) or is updated to 1 (if `f[8]` is false), and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
