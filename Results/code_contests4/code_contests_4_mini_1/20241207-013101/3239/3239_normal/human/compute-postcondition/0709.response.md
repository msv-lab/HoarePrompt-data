The code `l.append(g[2])` appends the value at index 2 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The previous state does not provide specific values for `g` or `l`, but `g` must exist and have at least 3 elements (since we are accessing index 2), and `l` must also exist. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `l` has an additional element which is `g[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `l` has an additional element which is `g[2]**
