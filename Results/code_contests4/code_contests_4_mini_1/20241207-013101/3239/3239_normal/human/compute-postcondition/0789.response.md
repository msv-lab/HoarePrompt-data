The variable `j` is increased by 1 before this line of code executes. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `j`) do not change, but the state of the list `l` is impacted by the addition of the new value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `j` is added to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `j` is added to the list `l`.**
