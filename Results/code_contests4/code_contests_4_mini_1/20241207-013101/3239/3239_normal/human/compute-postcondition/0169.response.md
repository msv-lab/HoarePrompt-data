Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();` if `f[7]` is true, then `l` is updated to [0, 0]; `f` remains [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `g` remains a list of twelve 0's; `j` is 0; and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. Otherwise, `l` is updated to [0, 1]; `f` remains [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `j` is 1; and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.***
