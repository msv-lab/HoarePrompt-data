The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has already been increased by 1 and `l` has been updated to reflect this new value of `j`, the state of `g[7]` will now be equal to the current value of `j`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` has been increased by 1; `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`; `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` has been increased by 1; `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`; `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
