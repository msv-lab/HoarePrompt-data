Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and is divisible by 17. If `f[7]` is true, then `l` now includes `g[7]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the current value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
