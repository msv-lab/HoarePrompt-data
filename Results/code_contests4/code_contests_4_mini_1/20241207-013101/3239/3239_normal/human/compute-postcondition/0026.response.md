Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is either [0] if `f[2]` is true (non-zero), or [1] if `f[2]` is false (zero), `f` remains a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's where `g[2]` is 1 if `f[2]` is false, and `j` is 0 if `f[2]` is true or 1 if `f[2]` is false, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is divisible by 3; `f[2]` is incremented by 1.**
