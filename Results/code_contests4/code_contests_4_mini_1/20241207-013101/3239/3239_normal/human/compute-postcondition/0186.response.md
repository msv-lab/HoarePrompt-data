The code assigns the value of `j` to the 11th element of the list `g` (considering 0-based indexing). The current value of `j` is 1, so `g[10]` will now be updated to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.
