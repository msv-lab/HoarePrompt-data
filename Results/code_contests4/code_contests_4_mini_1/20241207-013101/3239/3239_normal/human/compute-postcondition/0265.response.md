Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, and `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000. If `f[10]` is true, then `l` is increased by one element from `g[10]`, where `g` has at least 11 elements. If `f[10]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` is assigned the value of `j`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
