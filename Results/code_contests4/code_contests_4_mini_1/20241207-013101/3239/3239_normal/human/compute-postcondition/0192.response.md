The value of `j` is 1, and the code assigns this value to `g[11]`. The list `g` initially contains twelve 0's, so after the assignment, the 12th element (index 11) of `g` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now a list of eleven 0's followed by 1, `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
