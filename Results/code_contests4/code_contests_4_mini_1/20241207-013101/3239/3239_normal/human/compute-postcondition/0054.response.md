The code assigns the value of `j` to the index 5 of list `g`. The variable `j` is currently 1, and since `g` is a list of twelve 0's, assigning `j` to `g[5]` changes the value at that index from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `l` is [1]; `f` is a list of twelve 0's; `g` is a list with the value at index 5 updated to 1; `j` is 1; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, and is divisible by 11; `f[5]` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `l` is [1]; `f` is a list of twelve 0's; `g` is a list with the value at index 5 updated to 1; `j` is 1; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, and is divisible by 11; `f[5]` is 0.**
