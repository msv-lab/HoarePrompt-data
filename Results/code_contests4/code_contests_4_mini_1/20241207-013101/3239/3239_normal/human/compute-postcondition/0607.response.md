The variable `j` is increased by 1, and then the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is now incremented by 1. The states of the other variables and the list `l` are not affected by this operation, aside from appending the new value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 3, the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 5, the value of `f[3]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.
