Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `n - 1` (the last index of `a`); `l` is a list containing the values of `j` for each unique divisor condition met; `j` is the total count of unique values added to `l`; `f[k]` is the count of occurrences of each divisor condition from 1 to 11 based on the values in `a`; `g[k]` is the last unique value assigned for each divisor from 1 to 11 (if applicable) based on the values in `a`.**
