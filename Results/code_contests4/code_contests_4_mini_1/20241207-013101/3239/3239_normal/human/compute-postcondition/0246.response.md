The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, which has been incremented by 1 and appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is known to be `j + 1` (after the increment), but since we do not know the initial value of `j`, we cannot specify the exact value assigned to `g[7]`. Additionally, the states of `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `a`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
