Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 or 5, and is divisible by 7. If `f[4]` is true, then `l` is updated to include `g[4]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1 and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
