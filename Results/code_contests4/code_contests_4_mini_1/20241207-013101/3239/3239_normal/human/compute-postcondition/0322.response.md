Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; and `a[i]` is divisible by 5. If `f[3]` is true, then `l` is updated to include `g[3]`. If `f[3]` is false, then `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
