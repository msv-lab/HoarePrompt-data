The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0 for the first iteration, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, and `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is 0.
