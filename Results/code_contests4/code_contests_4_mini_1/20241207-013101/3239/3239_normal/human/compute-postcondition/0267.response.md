The code appends the value of `g[11]` to the list `l`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation except for the list `l`, which will now include the value at index 11 of the list `g`. However, we do not have information about the contents of `g`, so we cannot determine what value is appended. 

The values of `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, and the value `g[11]` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, and the value `g[11]` has been appended to the list `l.**
