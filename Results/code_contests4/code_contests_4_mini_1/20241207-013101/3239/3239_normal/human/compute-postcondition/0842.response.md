The value of `j` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `j` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.**
