The variable `j` is increased by 1, but its previous value is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `j`. The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1, with the current value of `j` appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l.**
