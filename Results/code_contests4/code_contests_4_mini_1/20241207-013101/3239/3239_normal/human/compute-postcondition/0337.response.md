The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `a[i]` are not directly affected by this operation. However, it is important to note that the state of the variable `f[5]` is true, which indicates that `g[5]` can be accessed without any issues. Since there is no information about the current state of `l` or `g`, we can only mention that `g[5]` is being appended to `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is not divisible by 5; `a[i]` is not divisible by 7; `a[i]` is divisible by 11; `f[5]` is true; `g[5]` is appended to `l`.**
