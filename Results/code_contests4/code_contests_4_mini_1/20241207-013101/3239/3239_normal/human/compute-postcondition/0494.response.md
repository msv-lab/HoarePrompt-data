`l` is a list and `g` is an iterable (such as a list or tuple) from which the second element (index 1) is being appended to `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and we append `g[1]` to list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and we append `g[1]` to list `l`.**
