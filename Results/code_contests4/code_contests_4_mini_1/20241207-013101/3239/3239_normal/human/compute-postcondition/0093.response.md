The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` is 1, and since `l` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `l` will contain the value 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and is divisible by 23, and the element `f[9]` is 0.
