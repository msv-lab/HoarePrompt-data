The variable `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`. The previous values of the affected variables are `t`, `n`, and `i`. However, since we do not have the specific return value of `func_4()`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` has been assigned a value that is unknown, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`; `i` is `n - 1; a` is the value returned by `func_4()`.**
