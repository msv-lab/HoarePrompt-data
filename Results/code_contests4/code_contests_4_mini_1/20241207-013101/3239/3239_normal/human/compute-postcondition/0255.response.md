The code attempts to append the value of `g[9]` to the list `l`. However, we do not have any information about the variable `g` or the list `l`. Therefore, we cannot determine what `g[9]` refers to or the state of the list `l`. Since the execution of this line does not change any known variables aside from potentially causing an error if `g` does not have an index 9, we cannot provide a concrete output state based on the provided information.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `g` is unknown, and attempting to access `g[9]` may lead to an error if `g` does not have that index.**
