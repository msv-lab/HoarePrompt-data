Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `f[8]` is true, the outcome of `l.append(g[8])` is unknown due to unspecified lists `g` and `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has `j` appended to it, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
