The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The statement `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since the previous state of `l` is not provided, we cannot determine its content. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`**
