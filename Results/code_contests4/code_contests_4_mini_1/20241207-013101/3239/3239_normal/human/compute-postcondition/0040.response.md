The code `l.append(g[4])` appends the value of `g[4]` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `g` is a list of twelve 0's, which means `g[4]` is 0. Therefore, the list `l` will now contain a single element which is 0.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` now contains [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5, and `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and `f[4]` is true (non-zero).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` now contains [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5, and `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and `f[4]` is true (non-zero).**
