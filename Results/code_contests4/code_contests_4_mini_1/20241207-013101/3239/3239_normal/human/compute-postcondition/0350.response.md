The code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been previously increased by 1, but its exact value is unknown. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the list `l` has been updated with the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is not divisible by 5; `a[i]` is not divisible by 7; `a[i]` is not divisible by 11; `a[i]` is divisible by 13; `f[6]` is false; variable `j` is increased by 1; `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`.**
