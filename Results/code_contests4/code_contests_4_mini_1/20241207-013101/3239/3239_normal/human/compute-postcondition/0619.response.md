Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, and divisible by 7. If `f[4]` evaluates to true, then `g[4]` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, if `f[4]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
