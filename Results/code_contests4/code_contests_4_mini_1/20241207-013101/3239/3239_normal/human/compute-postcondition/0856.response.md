Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f[2]` is incremented by 1, and the effects on `g[2]` and `j` depend on the new value of `f[2]`. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is increased by 1; if `a[i]` is divisible by 7 (but not by 5), `f[4]` is incremented by 1, `l` is appended with the value of `g[4]`, and `j` and `g[4]` remain unchanged; if `a[i]` is divisible by 11 (but not by 5 or 7), `f[5]` is increased by 1, with the other variables unchanged; if `a[i]` is divisible by 13 (but not by 5, 7, or 11), `f[6]` is greater than or equal to its previous value, while `j`, `g[6]`, and `l` remain unchanged; if `a[i]` is divisible by 17 (but not by 5, 7, 11, or 13), `f[7]` is incremented by 1; if `a[i]` is divisible by 19 (but not by 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17), `f[8]` is true, while `j` and `g[8]` remain unchanged; if `a[i]` is divisible by 23 (but not by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19), `f[9]` is incremented by 1, and `n`, `i`, `j`, `g[9]`, and `l` remain unchanged; if `a[i]` is divisible by 29 (but not by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23), `f[10]` is increased by 1, while `g` remains undefined and `j` is unknown; finally, if `a[i]` is divisible by 31 (but not by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29), `f[11]` is increased by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` includes the new value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the new value of `j`.***
