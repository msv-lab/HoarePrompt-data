Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1, and the updates to `l`, `j`, and `g[8]` depend on the previous state of `f[8]`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 and if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 and is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 or 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1, while `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged.***
