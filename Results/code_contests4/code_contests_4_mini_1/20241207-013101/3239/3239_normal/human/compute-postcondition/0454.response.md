The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but it is known that `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation. Therefore, `j` has a specific value that is one more than its previous state. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1; `j` is appended to the list `l`**.
