Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `l` contains [0], `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[10]` updated to 1, `j` is 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, `l` contains the element 1, `f[11]` is increased by 1, `g[11]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 but is divisible by 31. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, then `f[11]`, `l`, `g[11]`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `a[i]` retains its original properties as described.***
