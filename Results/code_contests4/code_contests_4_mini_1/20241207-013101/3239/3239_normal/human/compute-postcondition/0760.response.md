The value of `g[10]` is assigned the current value of `j`. The previous values of `j` are not specified, but since `j` is increased by 1 before this line, `g[10]` will hold the value of `j` after it has been incremented. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.
