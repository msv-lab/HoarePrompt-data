The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1. The states of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, variable `j` is increased by 1**
