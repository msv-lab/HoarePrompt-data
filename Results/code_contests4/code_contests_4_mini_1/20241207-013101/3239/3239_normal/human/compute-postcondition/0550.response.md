`l` is a list and the code appends the current value of `j` to it. Since the initial values of `j` are unknown but it has been stated that `j` is increased by 1, we can say that `j` now holds a value that is one greater than its previous state. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
