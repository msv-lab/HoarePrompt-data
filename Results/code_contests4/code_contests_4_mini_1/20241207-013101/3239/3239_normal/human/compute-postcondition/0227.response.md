The value of `j` is increased by 1 before the execution of the code snippet. Now, `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `j` has been incremented, and `l` will now include this new value of `j`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.
