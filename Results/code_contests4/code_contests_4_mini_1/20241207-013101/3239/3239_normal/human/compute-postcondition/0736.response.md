The value of `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. The variable `j` has been previously increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`. Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value assigned to `g[6]`. However, `g[6]` will hold the current value of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
