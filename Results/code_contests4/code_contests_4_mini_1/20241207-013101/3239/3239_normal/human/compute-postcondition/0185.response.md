The code `l.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. The current value of `j` is 1, and `l` initially contains the single element [0]. After execution, `l` will contain two elements: [0, 1]. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
