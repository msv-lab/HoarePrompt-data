The code initializes `g` as a list containing twelve 0s. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Since `g` is being assigned a new list of twelve 0s, it does not depend on any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `g` is now a list of twelve 0s.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1();`; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `l` is an empty list; `f` is now a list of twelve 0s; `g` is a list of twelve 0s; `j` is the total count of unique integers appended to `l`; `func_8(max(l))` has been executed; and the loop is set to execute one more time.**
