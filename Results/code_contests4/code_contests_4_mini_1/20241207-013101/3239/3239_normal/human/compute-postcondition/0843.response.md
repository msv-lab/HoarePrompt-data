The value of `j` is increased by 1 before this line of code. The current value of `j` is not provided, but it is implied to be an integer. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since the value of `l` is not provided, we assume it exists.

The output state reflects that the list `l` has been updated by appending the new value of `j` to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now includes the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now includes the new value of `j`.**
