Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the element is odd and satisfies the divisibility conditions, and is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If the element is odd and satisfies the divisibility conditions, and is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If the element is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29, and is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If it is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, there is no change to `f[11]`.***
