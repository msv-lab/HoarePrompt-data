Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, and `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`. If `f[2]` is true, then `l` is now [0, 0], `f` remains [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. Otherwise, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` remains [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is now 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.***
