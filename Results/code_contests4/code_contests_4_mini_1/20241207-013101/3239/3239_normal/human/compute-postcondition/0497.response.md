The value of `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, the specific value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, but it is known that it is some integer greater than or equal to 1 (since it has been incremented). The value of `g[1]` will reflect whatever the value of `j` is at that moment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, which is now assigned to `g[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 which is now assigned to `g[1]`.**
