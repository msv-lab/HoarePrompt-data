The variable `j` is increased by 1 prior to the execution of the code. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables are such that `j` has been incremented, but the specific value of `j` is not known. Therefore, the output state indicates that the value of `j` has been added to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
