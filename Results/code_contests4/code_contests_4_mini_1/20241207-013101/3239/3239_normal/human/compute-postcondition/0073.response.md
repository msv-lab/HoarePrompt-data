The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `l`. The initial state indicates that `l` is an empty list, so after this operation, `l` will contain the value 1. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, and `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and the value of `f[7]` is 0.**
