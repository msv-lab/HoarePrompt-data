The code assigns the value of `j` to the 9th index of the list `g`. The variable `j` was previously increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, but its specific value is not given in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `g[9]` is now assigned the value of `j`, which is known to be greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
