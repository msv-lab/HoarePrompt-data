According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is at least -1. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `i`, which is currently `n - 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute again `func_1()` must return a value greater than `n - 1**.
