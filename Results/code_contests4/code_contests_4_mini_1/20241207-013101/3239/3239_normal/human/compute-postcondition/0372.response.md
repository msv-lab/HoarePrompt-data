Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17, and is divisible by 19. If `f[8]` is true, then `l` has the value of `g[8]` appended to it. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
