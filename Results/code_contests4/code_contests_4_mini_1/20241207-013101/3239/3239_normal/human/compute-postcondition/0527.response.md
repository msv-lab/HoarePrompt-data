The value of `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been previously increased by 1, its current value is unknown, but it is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `l`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`**
