Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
