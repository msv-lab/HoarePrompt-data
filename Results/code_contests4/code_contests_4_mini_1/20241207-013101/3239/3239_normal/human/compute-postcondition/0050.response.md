The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`. The initial state specifies that `g` is a list of twelve 0's, indicating that `g[5]` is 0. The list `l` is empty prior to this operation.

After executing the code, `l` will contain one element, which is the value of `g[5]`, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and `a[i]` is divisible by 11, and `f[5]` is true (non-zero).
