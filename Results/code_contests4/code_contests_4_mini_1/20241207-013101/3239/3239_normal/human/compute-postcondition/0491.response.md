Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 but divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is increased by 1, and the values of `l` and `g[4]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7 but divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is updated to true (or incremented by 1), with `l` and `g[6]` remaining unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13 but divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 but divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 but divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1, leaving `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 but divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `g[10]`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if it is neither divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, nor 31, there are no changes made to `f[11]`.***
