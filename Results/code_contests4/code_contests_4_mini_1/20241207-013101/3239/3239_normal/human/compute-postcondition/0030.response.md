The code `l.append(g[3])` appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. Given that `g` is initialized as a list of twelve 0's, `g[3]` is 0. Therefore, after executing this statement, the list `l` will contain one element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is a list containing one element [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and `f[3]` is true (non-zero).**
