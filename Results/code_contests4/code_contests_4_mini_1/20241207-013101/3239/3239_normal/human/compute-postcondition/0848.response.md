Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1, while `g` remains undefined and `j` is unknown. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` includes the new value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the new value of `j`.***
