The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. As `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, its current value is now 1 greater than its previous value. However, since we do not have the previous value of `j`, we can only state that `j` has been increased. The list `l` will now contain the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
