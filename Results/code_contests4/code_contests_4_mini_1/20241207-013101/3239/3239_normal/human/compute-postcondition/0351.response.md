The variable `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not given. Therefore, `g[6]` will hold the value of `j` after the increment. Other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updates made.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is not divisible by 5; `a[i]` is not divisible by 7; `a[i]` is not divisible by 11; `a[i]` is divisible by 13; `f[6]` is false; `j` is increased by 1; `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`; `g[6]` is `j`.**
