The code `l.append(g[1])` appends the element at index 1 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1, but these values do not directly affect the operation of appending to `l`. Since we do not have information about the current state of `l` or `g`, we focus on the action of appending without altering the known values. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and we append `g[1]` to `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and we append `g[1]` to `l.**
