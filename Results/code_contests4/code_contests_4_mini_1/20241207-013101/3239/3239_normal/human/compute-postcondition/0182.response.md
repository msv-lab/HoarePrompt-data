The value of `f[9]` is incremented by 1. Since `f[9]` is initially 0, after execution, `f[9]` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `l` is now [0, 0] or [0, 1] depending on the initial state of `f[9]`; `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]; `g` remains a list of twelve 0's; `j` is 0 or 1; and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.
