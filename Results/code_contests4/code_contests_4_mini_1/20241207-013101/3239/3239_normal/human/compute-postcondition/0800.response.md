The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
