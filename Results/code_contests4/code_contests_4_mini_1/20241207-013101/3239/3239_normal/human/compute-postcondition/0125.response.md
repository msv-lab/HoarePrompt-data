Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` is a list of twelve integers where `f[3]` is 1, `g` is a list of twelve integers where `g[3]` is 0, `j` is 0, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and is divisible by 5. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` remains an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1, `l` is updated based on the value of `f[4]`, `g` may change if `f[4]` was false, and `j` is updated accordingly. If not divisible by 7, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is greater than 1, `l` is [0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, and `j` is 0. If not divisible by 11 and divisible by 13, then `l` is either [0] or [1], `g[6]` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either unchanged or 1. If not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1, and if `f[7]` becomes 0, then `l` will be [1] and `g[7]` will be 1, `j` will be 1. If divisible by 19, then `l` is [1], `f[8]` equals 1, `g[8]` equals 0, and `j` is 1. If divisible by 23, then `l` will be [0] if `f[9]` was true, otherwise [1], and `g` is updated at index 9 based on `f[9]`. If divisible by 29 but not by 23, then `l` contains [0], `g[10]` is set to 1, and `j` is 1. If `a[i]` is neither divisible by 23 nor by 29, then `l` contains 1, `f[11]` is increased by 1, `g[11]` is now 1, `j` is 1, and `a[i]` retains its properties as an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 but is divisible by 31. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, then `f[11]`, `l`, `g[11]`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `a[i]` retains its original properties as described.***
