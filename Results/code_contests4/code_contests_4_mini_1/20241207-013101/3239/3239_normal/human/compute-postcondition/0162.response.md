The value of `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is currently 1, `g[6]` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.
