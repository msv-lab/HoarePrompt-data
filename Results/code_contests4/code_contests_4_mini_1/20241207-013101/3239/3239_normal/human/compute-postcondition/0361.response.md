The value of `g[7]` is assigned the current value of `j`. Since `j` is already increased by 1, `g[7]` will now hold this updated value of `j`. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` now includes the current value of `j`; `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now includes the current value of `j`; `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
