The value of `j` is increased by 1, and now `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `l` is affected by this operation as it will now contain the new value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is known to have been increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`**
