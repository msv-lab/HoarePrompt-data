The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown since it is not defined in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1; variable `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1; variable `j` is increased by 1**
