The value of `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. This means that the fourth element (index 3) of the list `g`, which was previously 0, is now updated to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned a value from `func_4()`, `l` is [0, 1], `f` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned a value from `func_4()`, `l` is [0, 1], `f` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
