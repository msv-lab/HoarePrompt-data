The value of `j` is 1, and the operation `g[8] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the 8th index of the list `g`. Since `g` is initially a list of twelve 0's, after the assignment, the value at index 8 will change from 0 to 1. The other values in the list remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.
