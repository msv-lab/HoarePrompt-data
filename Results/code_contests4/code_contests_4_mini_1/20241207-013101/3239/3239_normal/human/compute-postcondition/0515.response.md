The variable `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has already been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, its current value is known. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` has been increased by 1, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` has been increased by 1; `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
