The code appends the value of `g[6]` to the list `l`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. The specific value of `g[6]` is not provided, but we know that the operation will add this value to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and divisible by 13, the value of `f[6]` is true, and `l` now contains the value of `g[6]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and divisible by 13, the value of `f[6]` is true, and `l` now contains the value of `g[6]`.**
