The code `l.append(g[7])` appends the value of `g[7]` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, but we know that `g` is an array or list and that `g[7]` is accessed. The state of `l` will change as we add a new element to it, but the specifics of the value of `g[7]` are not given.

Since `l` is modified by appending an element, the output state will reflect that `l` has a new element, although we cannot specify what that element is.

Output State: **`l` is updated by appending `g[7]`**
