The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer `n` followed by `n` composite integers. Upon execution, the function returns results based on the analysis of these composite integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to handle multiple test cases of composite integers and return results based on the specified criteria for those integers.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes multiple test cases of composite integers, returning results based on the analysis of those integers.**
