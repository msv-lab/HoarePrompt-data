Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is true, while `j` and `g[8]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 and is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1, and `n`, `i`, `j`, `g[9]`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, not divisible by 23, and is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1, while `g` remains undefined and `j` is unknown. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, not divisible by 23, not divisible by 29, and is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` includes the new value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the new value of `j`.***
