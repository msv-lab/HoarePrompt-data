`l` is a list, and the code appends the current value of `j` to it. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1, but its specific value is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `l` now includes the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `l` now includes the new value of `j`.**
