The variable `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` is not specified. However, `l` contains the value of `j`, which is now the incremented value. Therefore, the output state reflects that `g[5]` now holds the value of `j`, which is the incremented value. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the value of `j`; `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
