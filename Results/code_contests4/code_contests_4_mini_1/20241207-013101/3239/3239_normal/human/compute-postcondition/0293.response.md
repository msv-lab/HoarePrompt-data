The variable `j` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as this code only impacts `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1();`; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `l` is an empty list; `f` is now a list of twelve 0s; `g` is a list of twelve 0s; `j` is 0; and the loop is set to execute one more time.
