The value of `f[7]` is incremented by 1. Since `f[7]` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `l` is updated to [0, 1]; `f` is updated to [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `j` is 1; and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.
