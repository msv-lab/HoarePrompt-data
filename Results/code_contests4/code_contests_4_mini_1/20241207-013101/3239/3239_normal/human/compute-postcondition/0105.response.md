Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, if `f[10]` is truthy (non-zero), then `l` contains [0] and other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is [1], `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[10]` updated to 1, `j` is 1, and other variables remain unchanged, with `a[i]` being an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23, and is divisible by 29.***
