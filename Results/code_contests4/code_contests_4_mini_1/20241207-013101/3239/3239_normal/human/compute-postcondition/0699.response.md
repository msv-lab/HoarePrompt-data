Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is increased by 1, while `j`, `l`, and `g[3]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, and 7, and divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1; if it is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, and divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1; if it is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1; if it is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1; if it is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1; if it is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29, and divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1; if it is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
