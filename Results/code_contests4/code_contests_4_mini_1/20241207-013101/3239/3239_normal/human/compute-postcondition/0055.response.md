Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, if `f[5]` is true (non-zero), `l` is now [0], while `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, and is divisible by 11. Otherwise, if `f[5]` is false (0), `l` is [1], `g` is updated such that the value at index 5 is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` remains an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, and is divisible by 11.***
