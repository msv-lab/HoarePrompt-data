`l` is a list, and `j` has already been increased by 1. The value of `j` is now appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state indicates that `j` has been incremented but does not provide its specific value, we can only describe the change. The states of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is the current value after incrementing, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` has been appended to the list `l**
