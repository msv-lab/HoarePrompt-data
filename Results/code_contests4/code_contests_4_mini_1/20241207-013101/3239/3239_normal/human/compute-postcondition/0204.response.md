Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();` If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `l` is updated to [0, 1], `f` becomes [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is now 1, and `i` is still 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `l` is updated to [0, 0], `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `l` is updated to [0, 0], `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the other variables remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 and is divisible by 11, then `l` is updated to [0, 0], `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is now 1, and `i` is still 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `l` is updated to [0, 1], `f` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` remains 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `l` is updated to [0, 1], `f` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1. For divisibility by 19, `l` can be [0, 0] or [0, 1] depending on `f[8]`, while `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], and `g` is either a list of twelve 0's or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], with `j` being 1 and `i` as 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23 but not by 19, `l` can be [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` updates to [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, with `j` being 0 or 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `l` is either [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` updates to [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], with `g` unchanged, and `j` is 0 or 1, while `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31 but not by 29, `l` is either [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` updates to [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, and `j` is now 1 or 0, with `i` being 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, or 31, then the values of `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their respective precondition states.***
