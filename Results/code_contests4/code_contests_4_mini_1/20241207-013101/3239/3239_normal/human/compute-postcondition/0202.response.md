Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();` If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `l` is updated to [0, 0], `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 and is divisible by 11, `l` is updated to [0, 0], `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `l` is updated to [0, 1], `f` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `l` is updated to [0, 1], `f` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `l` is either [0, 0] or [0, 1] depending on `f[8]`, `f` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], `g` is a list of twelve 0's or [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] depending on `f[8]`, `j` is 1; and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23 but not by 19, then `l` is either [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` updates to [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0 or 1; and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `l` is either [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` updates to [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0 or 1; and `i` is 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31 but not by 29, then `l` is either [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` updates to [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, and `j` is now 1 or 0, with `i` being 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, or 31, the values of `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their respective precondition states.***
