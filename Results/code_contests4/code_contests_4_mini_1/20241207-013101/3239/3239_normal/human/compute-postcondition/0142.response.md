The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. After the execution, `j` becomes 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
