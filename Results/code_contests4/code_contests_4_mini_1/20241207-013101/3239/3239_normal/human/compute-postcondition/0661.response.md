Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd (i.e., `a[i] % 2 != 0`), the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 3 (i.e., `a[i] % 3 != 0`), the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 5 (i.e., `a[i] % 5 != 0`), the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 7 (i.e., `a[i] % 7 != 0`), the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 11 (i.e., `a[i] % 11 != 0`), the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 13 (i.e., `a[i] % 13 != 0`), the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 17 (i.e., `a[i] % 17 != 0`), and the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 19 (i.e., `a[i] % 19 != 0)`***
