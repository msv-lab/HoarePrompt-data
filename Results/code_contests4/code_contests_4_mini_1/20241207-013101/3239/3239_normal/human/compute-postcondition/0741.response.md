The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` has already been increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` is not specified in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the action taken regarding the list `l` and the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
