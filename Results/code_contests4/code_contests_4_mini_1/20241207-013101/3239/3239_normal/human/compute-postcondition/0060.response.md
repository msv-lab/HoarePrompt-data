The code `l.append(g[6])` will append the value of `g[6]` to the list `l`. The initial state specifies that `g` is a list of twelve 0's, so `g[6]` is 0. Thus, appending `g[6]` to `l` will result in `l` now containing a single element, which is 0.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now a list containing a single element 0, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and `f[6]` is true (non-zero).
