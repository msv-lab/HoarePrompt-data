The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables are `j` is increased by 1, meaning `j` is now 1 more than its previous value. However, the exact value of `j` prior to this increment is not specified. The value of `l` will change by adding the new value of `j`, but since we don't have the initial state of `l`, we cannot determine its contents after the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; `j` is increased by 1; and `l` now includes the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; `j` is increased by 1; and `l` now includes the new value of `j`.**
