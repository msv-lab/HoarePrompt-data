The code assigns the value of `j` to the 8th index of the list `g`. Since `j` has been previously increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, its current value is known and will be used for the assignment. The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and the contents of list `l` remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
