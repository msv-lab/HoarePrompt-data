Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. The values of `l`, `j`, and `g[10]` remain undetermined.***
