The value of `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` was increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `g[2]` without knowing the specific value of `j`. However, we can state that `g[2]` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 1, `j` has been appended to the list `l`, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
