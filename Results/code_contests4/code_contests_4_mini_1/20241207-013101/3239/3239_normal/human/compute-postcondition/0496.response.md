The variable `j` is being appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation, but the specific value of `j` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1, which is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`.**
