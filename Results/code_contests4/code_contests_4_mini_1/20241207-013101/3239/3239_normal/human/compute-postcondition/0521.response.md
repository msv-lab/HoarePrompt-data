In the initial state, `j` has been increased by 1, and it has been appended to the list `l`. The code snippet `g[5] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the 6th index (index 5) of the list `g`. The previous value of `j` is known (it has been increased by 1), but the previous values of `g` are not specified. 

Thus, after executing the code, the value of `j` remains unchanged and `g[5]` is now assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` has been increased by 1; `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
