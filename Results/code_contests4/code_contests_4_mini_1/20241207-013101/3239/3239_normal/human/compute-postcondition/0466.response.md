The value of `j` has been increased by 1 prior to the execution of the code. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `l` is assumed to be already defined as a list, its state will change to include the new value of `j`. The exact value of `j` is not specified, but it is known that it has been incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `l` and the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is the incremented value, and `l` includes the new value of `j`**
