The variable `j` is increased by 1, and then the new value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it.**
