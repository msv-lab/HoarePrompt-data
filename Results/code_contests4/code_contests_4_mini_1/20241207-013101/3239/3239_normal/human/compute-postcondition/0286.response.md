Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is a list containing integers from 1 to `j`, `f` is a list where `f[1]` to `f[11]` represent the counts of occurrences for even numbers and prime factors (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31) respectively, `g` contains the last unique integer assigned to each prime factor from 2 to 31, `j` is the total count of unique integers appended to `l`, and `func_8(max(l))` is executed with the maximum value from list `l`.**
