The variable `j` is increased by 1. The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. However, since the previous value of `j` is unknown, we cannot state a specific value for the appended element. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to `l.**
