The value of `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, which has been previously increased by 1. The variable `l` now holds the value of `j`, but since `g[10]` is being set to `j`, this means `g[10]` will also reflect the incremented value of `j`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
