The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It processes a number of test cases, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it considers an integer `n`, along with a list of composite integers `a_i`. The integers `a_i` are constrained to be between 4 and 1000. The function returns a result based on the processed data from these test cases. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to handle multiple test cases involving composite integers within specified bounds and return a result based on the computations performed on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes multiple test cases involving composite integers, returning a result based on the computations for those test cases.**
