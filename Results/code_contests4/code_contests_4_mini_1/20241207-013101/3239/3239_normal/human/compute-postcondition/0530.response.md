The code `l.append(g[7])` adds the value at index 7 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The initial states of the variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, and we do not have information about the lists `l` and `g`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged states of `t`, `n`, and `i`, along with the action of appending an element to `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and we append g[7] to l.**
