Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` contains either [0] if `f[4]` is true (non-zero) or [1] if `f[4]` is false (zero). The list `f` remains as a list of twelve 0's, the list `g` has `g[4]` set to 1 if `f[4]` is false, while `g` remains unchanged if `f[4]` is true. The variable `j` is 0 if `f[4]` is true and 1 if `f[4]` is false. The iteration index `i` is 0 for the first iteration, and the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5, and is divisible by 7 in both cases.***
