Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [0] if `f[9]` is true, otherwise `l` is [1]. The list `f` remains a list of twelve 0's if `f[9]` is true, but if `f[9]` is false, `g` will have eleven 0's and one 1 at index 9, `j` will be 0 for the first iteration if `f[9]` is true and 1 if `f[9]` is false, and `i` is 0 for the first iteration. The element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and is divisible by 23 in either case.***
