The list `l` is updated by appending the value at index 6 of list `g` to it. The current state of `g` is known to be a list of twelve 0's, which means `g[6]` is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, the list `l` will now contain [0, 0].

The other variables (`f`, `j`, `i`, and the values of `a`, `t`, `n`, and `a_i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 0], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
