The variable `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, which was increased by 1 previously. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will include the current value of `j` and the assignment to `g[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the first element of the list `a` at index `i` is even; `f[1]` is false; `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j` after incrementation; `g[1]` is `j`.**
