The code snippet `l.append(g[3])` appends the value of `g[3]` to the list `l`. However, the previous values of `g` and `l` are not specified in the initial state. Thus, we cannot determine the value of `g[3]` or the contents of `l` before the operation. The operation will not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Since we are appending to `l`, the output state will indicate that a value has been added to the list, but without knowing the specific content of `g[3]`, we cannot specify what that value is.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and a value has been appended to the list `l` from `g[3]`.**
