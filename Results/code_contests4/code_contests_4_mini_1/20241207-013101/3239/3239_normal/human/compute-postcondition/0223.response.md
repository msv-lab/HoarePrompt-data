Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, and `i` is 2. If `f[3]` is true, then `l` is updated to include the value of `g[3]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, appended to the list `l`, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
