Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `j` is assigned the value of `l`, `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1 while the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1 and `g[5]` is appended to the list `l`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is updated to a value greater than or equal to its previous value. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is updated to 2 if it was True, and to 1 if it was False. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `f[11]` remains unchanged.***
