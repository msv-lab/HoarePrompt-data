The code `l.append(g[2])` appends the value at index 2 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `g` or `l`, so we cannot determine the exact outcome of the operation aside from stating that an item will be appended to `l`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the action taken without specifying the values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and we append the value of `g[2]` to `l`.**
