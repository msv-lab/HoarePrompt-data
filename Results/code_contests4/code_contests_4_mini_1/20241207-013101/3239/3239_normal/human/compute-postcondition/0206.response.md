According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2.**
