In this case, the code `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been incremented and its value is now appended to the list `l`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` has been increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
