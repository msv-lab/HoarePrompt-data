The variable `g` is being updated such that the key `4` in the dictionary `g` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`. However, the exact value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value assigned to `g[4]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged after this operation. Thus, the output state summarizes the relevant information we have.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
