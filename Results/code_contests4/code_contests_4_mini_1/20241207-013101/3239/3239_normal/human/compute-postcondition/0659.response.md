Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd and meets the divisibility conditions of not being divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and being divisible by 19; if `f[8]` is true, then `g[8]` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, if `f[8]` is false, `j` is incremented, is appended to list `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
