According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute one more time. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be greater than 1, because if `n` is equal to 1, the loop will not execute again after this iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
