The value of `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `g[5]` without additional information about `j`. However, we can conclude that `g[5]` is now set to `j`, which is the updated value after incrementing.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the previous elements of `l` plus the new value of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the previous elements of `l` plus the new value of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
