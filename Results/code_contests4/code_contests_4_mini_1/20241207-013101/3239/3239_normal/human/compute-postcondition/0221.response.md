The `l` list is being appended with the current value of `j`, which has been increased by 1 prior to this line. Since the specific value of `j` is not given, we can only state that it is now 1 greater than its previous value. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and we do not know the contents of `l` before the append operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `j` has been used to update `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
