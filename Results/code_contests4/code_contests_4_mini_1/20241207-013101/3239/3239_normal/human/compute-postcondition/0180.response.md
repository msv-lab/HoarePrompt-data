The value of `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. The previous values of `g` are a list of twelve 0's. Therefore, after this assignment, `g[9]` will change from 0 to 1, while the other elements of `g` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned a value from `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
