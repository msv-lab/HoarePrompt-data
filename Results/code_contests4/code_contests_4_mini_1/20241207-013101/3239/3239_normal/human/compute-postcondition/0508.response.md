The value of `j` is increased by 1 before the execution of the given code. However, the exact value of `j` prior to this increment is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, when executing `l.append(j)`, we append the updated value of `j` (which is incremented by 1) to the list `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. 

Since `j` is increased by 1, we can represent the new value of `j` as `j + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains `j + 1` appended to it.**
