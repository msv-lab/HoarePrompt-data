The value of `j` is assigned to the 11th index of the list `g`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it has been increased by 1, and `l` contains the value of `j`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`j` has been increased by 1; `l` contains the value of `j`; `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
