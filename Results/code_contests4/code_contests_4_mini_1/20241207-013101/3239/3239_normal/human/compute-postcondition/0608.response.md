The value of `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is increased by 1 prior to this assignment, the new value of `j` is now 1. The previous state of `g[3]` is unknown, but it is now assigned the value of `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 3, the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 5, the value of `f[3]` is false, `j` is 1, and `l` contains the value `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 3, the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 5, the value of `f[3]` is false, `j` is 1, and `l` contains the value `1`; `g[3]` is 1.**
