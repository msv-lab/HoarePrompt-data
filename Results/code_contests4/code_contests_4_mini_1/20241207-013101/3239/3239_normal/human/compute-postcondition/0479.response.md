The value of `j` is increased by 1 before the execution of the code snippet, and then `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it has been incremented by 1. Since the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this operation, the output state will reflect the change in `g[11]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now has `j` appended to it, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
