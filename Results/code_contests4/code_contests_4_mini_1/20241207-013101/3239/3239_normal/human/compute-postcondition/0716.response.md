The value of `j` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `j` is unknown, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
