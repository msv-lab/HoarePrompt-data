Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer not divisible by 3 or 5. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7 but is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1, and `g[5]`, `j`, and list `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 and remains an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11, and is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, `f[7]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1; if not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1; if not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented by 1, while `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged.***
