Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, then `l` now contains the value of `g[6]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
