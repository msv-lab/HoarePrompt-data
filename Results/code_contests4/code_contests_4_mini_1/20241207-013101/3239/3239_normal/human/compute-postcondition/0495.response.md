The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state reflects that the variable `j` has been increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and variable `j` is increased by 1.**
