The value of `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and `l` now contains this updated value of `j`, `g[4]` will be set to the new value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the updated value of `j`; `g[4]` is set to the updated value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the updated value of `j`; `g[4]` is set to the updated value of `j`.**
