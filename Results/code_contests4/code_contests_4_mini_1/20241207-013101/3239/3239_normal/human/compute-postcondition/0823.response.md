The code `l.append(g[8])` suggests that we are appending the value located at index 8 of the list or array `g` to another list `l`. Since no specific values for `g` or `l` are provided, we cannot determine the exact values being appended or the state of `l` after the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the operation has taken place, but without specific values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2; the value at index 8 of `g` has been appended to `l`.**
