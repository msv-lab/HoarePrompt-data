The value of `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and is now a specific value, `g[8]` takes on that same value. The previous value of `g[8]` is not specified, but it is now updated. The state of variable `l` remains unchanged from its previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` has been increased by 1; `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it; `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` has been increased by 1; `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it; `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
