Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `l` is now [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, and `j` is 0 or 1, with `i` being 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, then `l` is now [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, and `j` is now 1 or 0, with `i` still being 1 for the second iteration. If `a[i]` is neither divisible by 29 nor 31, the values of `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their respective precondition states.***
