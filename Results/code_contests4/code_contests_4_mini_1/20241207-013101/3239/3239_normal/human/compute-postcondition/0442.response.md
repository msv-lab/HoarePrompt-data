The variable `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` was previously increased by 1, its current value is now known to be at least 1 (depending on its previous value before the increment). The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
