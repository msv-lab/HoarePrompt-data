The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is not divisible by 5; `a[i]` is not divisible by 7; `a[i]` is not divisible by 11; `a[i]` is not divisible by 13; `a[i]` is not divisible by 17; `a[i]` is divisible by 19; `f[8]` is false; variable `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is not divisible by 5; `a[i]` is not divisible by 7; `a[i]` is not divisible by 11; `a[i]` is not divisible by 13; `a[i]` is not divisible by 17; `a[i]` is divisible by 19; `f[8]` is false; variable `j` is increased by 1.**
