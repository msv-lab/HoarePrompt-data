Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd and divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is true, then `g[2]` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, `f[2]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
