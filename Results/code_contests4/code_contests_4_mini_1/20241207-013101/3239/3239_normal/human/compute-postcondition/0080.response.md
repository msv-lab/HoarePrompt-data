The code appends the value of `g[8]` to the list `l`. The previous value of `g` is a list of twelve 0's, so `g[8]` is 0. Therefore, after execution, the list `l` will contain one element which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is a list containing one element 0, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, and `a[i]` is divisible by 19, and `f[8]` is true (i.e., `f[8]` is non-zero).**
