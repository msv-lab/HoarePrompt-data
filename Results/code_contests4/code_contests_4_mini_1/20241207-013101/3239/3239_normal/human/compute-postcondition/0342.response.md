Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7; `a[i]` is divisible by 11; if `f[5]` is true, then `g[5]` is appended to the list `l`. Otherwise, if `f[5]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, the new value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[5]` is set to `j`.***
