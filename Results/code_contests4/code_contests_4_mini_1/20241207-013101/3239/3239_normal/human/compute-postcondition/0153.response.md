The value `g[5]` accesses the sixth element of the list `g`, which is a list of twelve 0's. Therefore, `g[5]` is 0. The `append` method adds this value to the list `l`. 

Before the operation, `l` was [0]. After executing `l.append(g[5])`, `l` will be [0, 0]. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 0], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
