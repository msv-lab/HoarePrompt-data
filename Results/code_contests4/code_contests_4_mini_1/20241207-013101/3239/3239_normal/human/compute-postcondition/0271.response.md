Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2. If `f[11]` is true, then the value `g[11]` has been appended to the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` has been increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
