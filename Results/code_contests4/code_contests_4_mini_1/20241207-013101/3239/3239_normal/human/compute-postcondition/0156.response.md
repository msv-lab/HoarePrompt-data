The value at index 5 of the list `g` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, the state of variable `g` changes at index 5.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now a list of twelve integers where the 6th element is 1, `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
