Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is a list containing the element 1, `f[11]` is increased by 1, `g[11]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 and divisible by 31. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, then `f[11]`, `l`, `g[11]`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `a[i]` retains its original properties as described.***
