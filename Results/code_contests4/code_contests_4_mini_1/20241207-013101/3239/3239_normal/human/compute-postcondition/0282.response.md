Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a[i]` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 1000, and `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();` with `i` equal to 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, then `f[2]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, then `f[3]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, then `f[5]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23 and `f[9]` was false, then `f[9]` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, appended to the list `l`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. The values of `l`, `j`, and `g[10]` remain undetermined in this latter case.***
