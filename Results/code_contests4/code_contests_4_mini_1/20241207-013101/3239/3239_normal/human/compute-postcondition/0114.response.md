`g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `g` is a list of twelve 0's and `j` is 1. After the execution of the code, the last element of `g` changes from 0 to 1, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is a list containing the element 1, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's where `g[11]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 and is divisible by 31.
