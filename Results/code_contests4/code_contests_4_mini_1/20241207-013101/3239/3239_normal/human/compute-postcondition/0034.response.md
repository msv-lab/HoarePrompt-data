The value of `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. The previous value of `g[3]` is 0 (since `g` is a list of twelve 0's). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `f`, `j`, `i`, and the conditions on `a[i]`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[3]` now 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, and `a[i]` is divisible by 5, and the fourth element of `f` is 0.
