Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` contains either [0] if `f[8]` is true or [1] if `f[8]` is false, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[8]` being 1 only if `f[8]` is false, `j` is 0 if `f[8]` is true and 1 if `f[8]` is false, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, and is divisible by 19.***
