`l` is updated by appending the value of `g[9]` to it. Since `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `g[9]` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `l` will now be `[0, 0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 0], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
