Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `f[7]` is incremented by 1, `l` is unchanged but will depend on the new value of `f[7]`, and the values of `g`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged if `f[7]` was truthy. If `f[7]` becomes 0, then `l` will be [1], `g[7]` will be now 1, `j` will be 1, and `i` will be 0, while `a[i]` remains an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and divisible by 17.**
