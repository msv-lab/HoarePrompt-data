`f[8]` is incremented by 1. Since `f[8]` was initially true, after the increment, it remains true. Thus, `g[8]` is not modified, and `l` remains unaffected. The variable `j` is also not affected in this case. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[8]` is now true, `j` is unchanged, and `g[8]` is unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[8]` is now true, `j` is unchanged, and `g[8]` is unchanged.**
