The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state reflects that variable `j` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is divisible by 5; `f[3]` is false; variable `j` is increased by 1**
