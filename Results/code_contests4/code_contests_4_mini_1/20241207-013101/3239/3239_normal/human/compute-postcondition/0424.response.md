The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been previously increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` is currently an incremented value, and `l` now contains this value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.**
