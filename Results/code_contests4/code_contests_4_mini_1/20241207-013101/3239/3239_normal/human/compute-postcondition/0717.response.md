The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` is increased by 1 before this code runs, meaning that `j` has a specific value (which is unknown but at least 1). Therefore, after executing the code, the list `l` will have the value of `j` appended to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `j` is appended to list `l`.**
