The value of `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 1. The previous value of `g[1]` is 0 (since `g` is currently a list of twelve 0's). Other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, after execution, `g[1]` updates from 0 to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
