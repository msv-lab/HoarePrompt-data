The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 as per the initial state, but the exact value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been appended to `l` without changing the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to `l`.**
