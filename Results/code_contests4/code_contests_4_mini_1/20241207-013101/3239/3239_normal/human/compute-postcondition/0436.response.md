In the given code, `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been mentioned to be increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, the impact of the code is that it appends the value of `j` to the list `l`, but the exact value of `j` is unknown.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j` which has been increased by 1.**
