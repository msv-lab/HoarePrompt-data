The code `f[9] += 1` increments the value of `f[9]` by 1. The output state will reflect this change, but the state of other variables remains unaffected. The specific values of `f[9]`, `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` are not given, so we cannot determine their exact states after the operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `f[9]` is incremented by 1, and the states of `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f[9]` is incremented by 1, and the states of `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged.**
