The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1.
