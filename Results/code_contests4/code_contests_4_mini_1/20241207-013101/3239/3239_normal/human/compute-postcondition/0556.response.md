The variable `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The value of `l` after appending `j` will depend on the updated value of `j`. Since the initial states of `l` and `j` were not provided, we cannot specify their exact values. However, we acknowledge that `j` has been incremented and `j` is appended to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l.**
