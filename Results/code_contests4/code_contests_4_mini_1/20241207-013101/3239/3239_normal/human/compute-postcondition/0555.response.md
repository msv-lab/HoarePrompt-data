The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2; variable `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2; variable `j` is increased by 1**
