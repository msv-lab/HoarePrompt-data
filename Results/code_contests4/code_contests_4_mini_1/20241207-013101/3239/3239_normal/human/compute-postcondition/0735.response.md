`l` is a list, and the code appends the current value of `j` to it. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been incremented and added to the list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.**
