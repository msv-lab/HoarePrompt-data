The line `g[3] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the index `3` of the list or array `g`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1, and now `l` contains the updated value of `j`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `j` being assigned to `g[3]` and the current state of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is divisible by 5; `f[3]` is false; `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`; `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
