Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2. If `f[9]` is true, `l` remains unchanged, and accessing `g[9]` may cause an error if `g` does not have that index. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, appended to the list `l`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
