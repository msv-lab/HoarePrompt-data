The variable `j` is increased by 1, but its previous value is not provided, so we only know that `j` has been incremented. The value of `l` is not provided, but it is assumed to be a list that can accept new elements. The code appends the new value of `j` to the list `l`. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `j` and the change in list `l` due to the append operation.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` has the new value of `j` appended to it.**
