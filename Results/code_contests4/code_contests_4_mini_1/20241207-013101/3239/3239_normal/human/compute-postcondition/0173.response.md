The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. Given that `j` is currently 1, `l` which initially contains `[0]` will now include the value 1. Therefore, `l` becomes `[0, 1]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
