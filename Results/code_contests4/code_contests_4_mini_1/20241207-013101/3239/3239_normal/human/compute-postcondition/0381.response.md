The code assigns the value of `j` to the index `9` of the array `g`. The previous value of `j` is known (it has been increased by 1), and `g[9]` will now hold this updated value. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19; `a[i]` is divisible by 23; `f[9]` is false; `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the new value of `j`; `g[9]` is now equal to `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19; `a[i]` is divisible by 23; `f[9]` is false; `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the new value of `j`; `g[9]` is now equal to `j`.**
