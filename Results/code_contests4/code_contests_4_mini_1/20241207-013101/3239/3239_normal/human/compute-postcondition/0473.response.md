The statement `g[10] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the 10th index of the list or array `g`. The previous state indicates that `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. The variable `g` is assumed to be defined, and the value of `j` at this point is now the result of its previous increment.

Since `g[10]` directly reflects the value of `j`, the specific value of `j` will determine what gets assigned to `g[10]`. However, we know that `j` is greater than its previous state by 1.

The output state remains dependent on the value of `j` and indicates that the assignment has occurred. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `l`) remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
