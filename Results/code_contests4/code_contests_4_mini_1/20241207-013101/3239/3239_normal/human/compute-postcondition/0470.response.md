The code snippet `l.append(g[10])` attempts to append the value at index 10 of the list (or array) `g` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the lists `l` or `g`. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value that will be appended to `l`. 

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and we append the value at index 10 of list `g` to list `l`.**
