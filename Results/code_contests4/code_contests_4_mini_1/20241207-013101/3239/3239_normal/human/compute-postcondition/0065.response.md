Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, if `f[6]` is true (non-zero), then `l` is a list containing a single element 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `f[6]` is false (0), `l` now contains [1], `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[6]` now being 1, and `j` is 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. In both cases, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, and `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11, and is divisible by 13.***
