The `file.write(str(x))` statement will write the string representation of `x` to the `file`. Since `x` is the second element of `args`, it will be converted to a string and written to the `file`. The values of `sep`, `at_start`, and `args` do not change, and the state of the `file` will reflect that `x` has been written to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element of `args`, and `x` has been written to `file`.
