The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 3, the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 5, the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is false, and `j` is increased by 1.
