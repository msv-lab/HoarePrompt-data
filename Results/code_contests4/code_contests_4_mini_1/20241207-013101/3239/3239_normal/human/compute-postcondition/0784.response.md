The variable `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` has already been increased by 1, so the value of `g[1]` will now reflect this updated value of `j`. The state of other variables, such as `l`, remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it; `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it; `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
