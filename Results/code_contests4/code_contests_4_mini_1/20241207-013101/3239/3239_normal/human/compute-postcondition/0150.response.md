The value of `j` is 1, and `g` is a list of twelve 0's. The code assigns the value of `j` to the index 4 of the list `g`. Therefore, `g[4]` will now be 1. The other values in `g` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
