The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 prior to this operation, but we do not know its specific value. Since `l` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume it is an empty list at the start. Therefore, after execution, `j` will hold its incremented value, and `l` will contain the new value of `j`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the new value of `j`.**
