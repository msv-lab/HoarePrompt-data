The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The variable `j` has been previously increased by 1, so its value is now `j + 1`. The values of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. The specific value of `j` before this operation is not given, but it has been incremented. Therefore, after executing the code, the list `l` will contain the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to list `l`.**
