Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer not divisible by 3; if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `f[3]` is incremented by 1, while the impacts on `l`, `j`, and `g[3]` are uncertain. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5 and is an odd integer not divisible by 3 or 5, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 11, `f[5]` is increased by 1, with `g[5]`, `j`, and list `l` remaining unchanged; if divisible by 13, `f[6]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 17, `f[7]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1; if divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1; if divisible by 31, `f[11]` is incremented by 1, while `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged.***
