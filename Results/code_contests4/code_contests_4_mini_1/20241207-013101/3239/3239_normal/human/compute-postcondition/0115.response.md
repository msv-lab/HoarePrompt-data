Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, if the last element of the list `f` (i.e., `f[11]`) is truthy (non-zero), then `l` is [0] and the state remains unchanged for `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the element 1, `g[11]` is now 1, `j` is 1, and `i` is 0 for the first iteration, while `a[i]` remains the same as an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 and is divisible by 31.***
