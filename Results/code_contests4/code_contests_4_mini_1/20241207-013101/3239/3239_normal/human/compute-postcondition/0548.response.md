The code `l.append(g[10])` appends the value of `g[10]` to the list `l`. The initial state does not provide values for `g` or `l`, but we can infer that `g` should be a list or array with at least 11 elements (since we are accessing the index 10). The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, and `i`, along with the action taken.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `g[10]` is appended to `l`.**
