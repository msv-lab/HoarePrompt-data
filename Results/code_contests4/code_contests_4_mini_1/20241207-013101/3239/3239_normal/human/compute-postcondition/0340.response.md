The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and now its updated value is appended to the list `l`. The previous state of `j` is not specified, but it has been increased by 1 for this operation. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is not divisible by 5; `a[i]` is not divisible by 7; `a[i]` is divisible by 11; `f[5]` is false; `j` is increased by 1; the new value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3; `a[i]` is not divisible by 5; `a[i]` is not divisible by 7; `a[i]` is divisible by 11; `f[5]` is false; `j` is increased by 1; the new value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
