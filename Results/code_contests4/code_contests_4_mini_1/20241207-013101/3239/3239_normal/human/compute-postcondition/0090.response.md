The code `l.append(g[9])` appends the value of `g[9]` to the list `l`. Given that `g` is initialized as a list of twelve 0's, `g[9]` is 0. Therefore, the list `l`, which is currently empty, will now contain a single element which is 0.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `f`, `j`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation, retaining their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration**.
