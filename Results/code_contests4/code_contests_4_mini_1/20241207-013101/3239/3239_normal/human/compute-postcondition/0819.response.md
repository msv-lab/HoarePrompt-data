The variable `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. The value of `l` will have `j` added to it. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been added to the list `l` while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
