The code assigns the value of `j` to the 9th index of the list `g`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `j` is the incremented value, and `l` includes the new value of `j`. However, we do not have the specific values of `g`, `j`, or `l`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is the incremented value, and `l` includes the new value of `j`.**
