Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 and `n` is greater than 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `g[10]`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and not divisible by 31, there are no changes made to `f[11]`.***
