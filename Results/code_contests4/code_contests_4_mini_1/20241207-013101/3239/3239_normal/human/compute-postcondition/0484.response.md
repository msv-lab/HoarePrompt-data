Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1, and the states of `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1 while `j`, `g[10]`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is neither divisible by 29 nor 31, there are no changes made to `f[11]`.***
