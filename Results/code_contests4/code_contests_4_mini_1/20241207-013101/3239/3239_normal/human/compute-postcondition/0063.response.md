The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. Given that `j` is initialized to 1, after executing this line, `l` will contain the value 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` now contains [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and `a[i]` is divisible by 13, and the value of `f[6]` is 0.
