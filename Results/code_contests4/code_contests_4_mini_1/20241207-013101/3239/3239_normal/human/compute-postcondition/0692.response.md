Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, or 29. If the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the element is also divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1; otherwise, there is no change to `f[11]`.***
