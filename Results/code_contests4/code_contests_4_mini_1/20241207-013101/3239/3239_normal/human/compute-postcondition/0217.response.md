Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, and `i` is 2. If `f[2]` is true, the value of `g[2]` is appended to the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
