Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, then `f[4]` is increased by 1 and the values of `l` and `g[4]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, then if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11 but divisible by 13, `f[6]` is updated to true (or incremented by 1), while `l` and `g[6]` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13 but divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, then `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1, leaving `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `g[10]`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if it is neither divisible by 29 nor 31, there are no changes made to `f[11]`.***
