Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, not divisible by 19, not divisible by 23, not divisible by 29, and if the element at index `i` in array `a` is also divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `f[11]`.***
