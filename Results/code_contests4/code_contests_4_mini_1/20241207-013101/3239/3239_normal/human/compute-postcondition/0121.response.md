Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, and `a[i]` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1, and if `f[7]` becomes 0, then `l` will be [1], `g[7]` will be now 1, `j` will be 1, and `i` will be 0, while `a[i]` remains an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and divisible by 17. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, and if it is divisible by 19, then `l` is [1], `f` is a list with `f[8]` equal to 1, `g` is a list with `g[8]` equal to 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `l` is [0] if `f[9]` was true, otherwise `l` is [1], `f` is updated to twelve 1's, `g` is a list of eleven 0's and one 1 at index 9 if `f[9]` was false, `j` is 0 if `f[9]` was true and 1 if `f[9]` was false, and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29 but not by 23, then `l` contains [0], `g` is updated with `g[10]` set to 1, `j` is 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is neither divisible by 23 nor by 29, `l` contains the element 1, `f[11]` is increased by 1, `g[11]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` retains its properties as an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 but is divisible by 31. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 31, then `f[11]`, `l`, `g[11]`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `a[i]` retains its original properties as described.***
