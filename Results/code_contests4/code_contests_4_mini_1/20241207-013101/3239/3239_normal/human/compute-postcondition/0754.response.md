The value of `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 and `l` now contains the new value of `j`, `g[9]` will reflect this updated value of `j`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; `j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the new value of `j`; `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
