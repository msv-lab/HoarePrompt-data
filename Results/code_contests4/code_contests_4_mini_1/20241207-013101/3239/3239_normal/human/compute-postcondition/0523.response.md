The variable `f[5]` is incremented by 1. Assuming `f[5]` was initially true (which is typically represented as 1 in a boolean context), it would now become 2 (or true in a boolean context). However, the code does not directly affect `g[5]`, `l`, or `j`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[5]` is now 2, `g[5]` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, and `l` is unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f[5]` is now 2, `g[5]` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged**
