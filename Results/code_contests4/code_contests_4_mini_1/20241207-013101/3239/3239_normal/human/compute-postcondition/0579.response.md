The code initializes `g` as a list containing 12 zeros using the expression `[0] * 12`. This means `g` will now be a new list with 12 elements, all set to 0. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is the value returned by `func_4()`; `l` is an empty list; `f` is a list of 12 zeros; `g` is a list of 12 zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is the value returned by `func_4()`; `l` is an empty list; `f` is a list of 12 zeros; `g` is a list of 12 zeros.**
