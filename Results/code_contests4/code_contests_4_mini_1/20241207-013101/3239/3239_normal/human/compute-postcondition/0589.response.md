Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is an even integer. If `f[1]` is true, then `l` has an element `g[1]` appended to it. If `f[1]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[1]` is equal to the current value of `j`.***
