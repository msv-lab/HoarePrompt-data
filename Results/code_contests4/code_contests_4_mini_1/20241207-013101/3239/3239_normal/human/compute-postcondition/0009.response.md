According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` collection. If `args` is non-empty, the loop can execute again for the next element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element of `args`, and since `args` is a non-empty collection, it has at least one more element after the first one. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust `x` to be the second element of `args`, and `args` must have at least 2 elements for this to occur.

State: **`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element of `args`.**
