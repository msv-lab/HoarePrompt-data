The value of `g[6]` is assigned the current value of `j`. Since `j` was increased by 1 prior to this assignment, the value of `g[6]` will reflect that incremented value. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 2; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `i` is 2; `l` now contains `j`; `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 2; `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`; `i` is 2; `l` now contains `j`; `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
