The value of `f[7]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `f[7]` are not specified, but it is affected directly by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, and `f[7]` is increased by 1.
