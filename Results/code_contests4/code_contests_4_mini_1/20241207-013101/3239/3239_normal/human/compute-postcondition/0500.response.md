The code `l.append(g[2])` attempts to append the value of `g[2]` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `l` or the variable `g`. Therefore, we cannot determine the values of `l` and `g[2]`.

The impact of this line is that `l` will have an additional element if `g[2]` exists, but since `l` and `g` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify their values. Consequently, the output state focuses on the operation of appending to `l`.

Output State: **`l` is modified by appending the value of `g[2]`, but the values of `l` and `g` are not defined.**
