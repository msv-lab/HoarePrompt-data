Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, the element at index `i` in array `a` is not divisible by 3, and the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 5. If `f[3]` is true, then `g[3]` is appended to list `l`. If `f[3]` is false, then `j` is set to 1, and `l` contains the value `1`, while `g[3]` is set to 1.***
