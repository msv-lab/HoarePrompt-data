Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is even, then `f[1]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is odd, `f[2]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f[3]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 5, `f[4]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[5]` is set to 2 if `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[6]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `f[7]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `f[8]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 19 with potential updates to `l`, `j`, and `g[8]`, `f[9]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, `f[10]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, and `f[11]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 31, while `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged.***
