The variable `j` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0 (since `j` is 0 for the first iteration). Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 1, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, not divisible by 19, not divisible by 23, not divisible by 29, and `a[i]` is divisible by 31, and the last element of `f` (i.e., `f[11]`) is 0.**
