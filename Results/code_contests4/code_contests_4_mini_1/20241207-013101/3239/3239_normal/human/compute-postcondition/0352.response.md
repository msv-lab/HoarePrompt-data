Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, or 11; `a[i]` is divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, `l` is appended with the value of `g[6]`. If `f[6]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`, and `g[6]` is set to `j`.***
