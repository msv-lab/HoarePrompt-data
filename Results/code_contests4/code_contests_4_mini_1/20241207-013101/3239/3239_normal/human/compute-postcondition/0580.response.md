The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` is the value returned by `func_4()`; `l` is an empty list; `f` is a list of 12 zeros; `g` is a list of 12 zeros; `j` is 0.
