Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that meets the specified conditions, including being divisible by 31. If `f[11]` is true, `l` is updated to include the value of `g[11]`. If `f[11]` is false, then `j` is set to 1, `l` is [1], and `g[11]` is 1.***
