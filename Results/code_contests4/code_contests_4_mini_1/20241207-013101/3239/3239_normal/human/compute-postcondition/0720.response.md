The value of `f[3]` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `f[3]` is unknown. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `l`, and `g[3]`) remain unchanged, as the increment operation affects only `f[3]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `l` holds the previous value of `j`; `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`; `f[3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `l` holds the previous value of `j`; `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`; `f[3]` is incremented by 1.**
