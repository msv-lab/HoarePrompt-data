The code appends the value of `g[7]` to the list `l`. The previous state indicates that `g` is a list of twelve 0's, which means `g[7]` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `l` will contain a single element which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, and `a[i]` is divisible by 17, and the value of `f[7]` is truthy (non-zero).**
