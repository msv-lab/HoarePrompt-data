The code `l.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but it has been increased by 1 prior to this operation. The variable `a` is assigned the result of `func_4()`, but this operation does not affect `j` or `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain unchanged as well. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the previous elements of `l` plus the new value `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the previous elements of `l` plus the new value `j.**
