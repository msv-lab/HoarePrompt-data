The value of `f[11]` is incremented by 1. Given that the previous state of `f` is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], after the execution of `f[11] += 1`, `f[11]` becomes 1, resulting in `f` being [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is now 1 or 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.
