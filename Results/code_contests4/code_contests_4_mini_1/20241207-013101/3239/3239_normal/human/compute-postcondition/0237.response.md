The code attempts to append the value found at index 6 of the list `g` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the content of the list `g` or the list `l`. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the value that will be appended. The other variables remain unaffected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, and we append `g[6]` to `l`.**
