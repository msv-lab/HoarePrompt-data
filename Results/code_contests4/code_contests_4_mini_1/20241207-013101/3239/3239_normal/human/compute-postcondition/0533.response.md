The value of `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 from its previous state, the value assigned to `g[7]` will be the updated value of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the new value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now includes the new value of `j`, `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
