The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The state of the variable `l` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a list. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, and the current value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
