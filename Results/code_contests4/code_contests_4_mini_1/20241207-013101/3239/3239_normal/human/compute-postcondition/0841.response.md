The code attempts to append the value of `g[11]` to the list `l`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `l` or the list `g`. Since we don't know the current state of `l` and whether `g` has an index 11, we cannot determine the impact of this operation on the program or the values of the affected variables.

Therefore, the output state is: `l` is unknown, `g` is unknown, and we are attempting to append `g[11]` to `l`.

Output State: **`l` is unknown, `g` is unknown, and we are attempting to append `g[11]` to `l`.**
