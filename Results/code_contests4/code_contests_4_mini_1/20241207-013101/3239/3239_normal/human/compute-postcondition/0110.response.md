The code `l.append(g[11])` appends the value of `g[11]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state where `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `g[11]` is 0. Therefore, appending this value to `l` means `l` will now contain a single element which is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is [0], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, not divisible by 19, not divisible by 23, not divisible by 29, and `a[i]` is divisible by 31, and the last element of the list `f` (i.e., `f[11]`) is a truthy value (non-zero).**
