According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The current state indicates that `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1();`, but we do not know the output of this function at this point. 

Since the loop is set to execute one more time, we can infer that the previous execution of the loop must have completed, and now `i` should be set to 0 for the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to account for the following:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which we cannot confirm without knowing the output of `func_1();`).
- `i` should start at 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

We will summarize the necessary conditions and state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
