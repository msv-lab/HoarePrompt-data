Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` remains a list of twelve integers where `f[2]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is divisible by 3, otherwise `f[3]` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is an odd integer not divisible by 3 and divisible by 5, while `g` is updated accordingly based on `f[3]` and other conditions. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, it retains its properties as an odd integer not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. Further updates to `f`, `l`, `g`, and `j` depend on the divisibility of `a[i]` by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31, with specific changes to `l`, `g`, and `j` depending on these conditions. Thus, `a[i]` remains an odd integer, and the various lists and variables are modified based on the divisibility checks.***
