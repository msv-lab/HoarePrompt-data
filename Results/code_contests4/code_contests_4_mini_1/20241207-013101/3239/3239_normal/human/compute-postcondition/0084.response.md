The statement `g[8] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the 9th element of the list `g` (since indexing starts at 0). The initial value of `j` is 1. This means that `g[8]` will be updated from 0 to 1. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the list `g`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` now contains [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's with `g[8]` now being 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0 for the first iteration, the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, and `a[i]` is divisible by 19, and the value of `f[8]` is 0.**
