The code `l.append(g[9])` suggests that the variable `l` is a list and `g` is a list or array from which the 10th element (index 9) is being appended to `l`. However, from the initial state, we do not have specific values for `l` or `g`.

Since the values of `l` and `g` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output state related to those variables. The operation will add the element `g[9]` to `l`, but without knowing the previous contents of `l` or the value of `g[9]`, we can only note that the operation will append an element.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and an element from `g` is appended to `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and an element from `g` is appended to `l.**
