The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown since it was not provided in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates that `j` has been increased but does not provide a specific value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1; `j` is increased by 1.**
