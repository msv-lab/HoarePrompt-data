According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
