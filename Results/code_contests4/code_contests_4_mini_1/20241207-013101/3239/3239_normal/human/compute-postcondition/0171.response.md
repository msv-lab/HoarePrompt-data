In the given code snippet, the operation `l.append(g[8])` adds the value at index 8 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The list `g` is mentioned to be a list of twelve 0's, which means `g[8]` is 0. Therefore, when we append this value to `l`, the list `l` will change from `[0]` to `[0, 0]`. 

No other variables are affected by this operation. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `l`.

Output State: **`l` is now [0, 0], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
