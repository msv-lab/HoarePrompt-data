Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2. If `f[1]` is true, then `l` is updated to include `g[1]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1 and `g[1]` is assigned the new value of `j`.***
