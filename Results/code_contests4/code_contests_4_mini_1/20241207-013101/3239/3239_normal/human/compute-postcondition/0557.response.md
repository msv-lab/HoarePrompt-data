The code assigns the value of `j` to the 11th index of the list `g`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but it has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`. The variable `t` is an integer within the range, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, and `g[11]` is now assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` has been increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
