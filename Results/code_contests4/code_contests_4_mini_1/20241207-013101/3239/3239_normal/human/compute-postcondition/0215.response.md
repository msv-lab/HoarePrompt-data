The value of `j` is increased by 1 prior to the execution of the code snippet. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Since the previous value of `j` is unknown but it has been increased by 1, the output state will reflect the change in `j` and the fact that `j` has been appended to the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2, `j` is increased by 1, and `j` has been appended to the list `l`.**
