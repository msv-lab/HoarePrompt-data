Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, if `f[7]` is truthy, then `l` is [0] and the values of `f`, `g`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and is divisible by 17. Otherwise, if `f[7]` is 0, then `l` is [1], `g[7]` is now 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and the same conditions apply to `a[i]` as in the previous case.***
