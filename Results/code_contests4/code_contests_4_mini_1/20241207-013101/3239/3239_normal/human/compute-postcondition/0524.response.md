The code attempts to append the value from the list `g` at index 6 to the list `l`. However, without knowing the current values of `g` and `l`, we cannot determine the actual value being appended. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will indicate that a value from `g[6]` is appended to `l`, but we cannot specify what that value is.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2; a value from `g[6]` is appended to `l`.**
