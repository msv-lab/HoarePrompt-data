The value of `j` is assigned to the 7th index (index 6, since indexing starts at 0) of the list `g`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but it is noted that `j` has been increased by 1 prior to this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, and `g[6]` is assigned the current value of `j`.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`**
