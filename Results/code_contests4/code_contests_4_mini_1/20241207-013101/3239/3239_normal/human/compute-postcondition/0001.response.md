The code assigns values to the variables `sep` and `file` by popping them from `kwargs`. If `sep` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space `' '`. Similarly, if `file` is not provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`, so we only note that these variables are affected by the assignment.

Output State: **`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`**
