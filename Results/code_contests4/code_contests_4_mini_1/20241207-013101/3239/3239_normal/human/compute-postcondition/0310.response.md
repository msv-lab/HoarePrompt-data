`j` is increased by 1, and then the updated value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that is also divisible by 3; `f[2]` is false; `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.
