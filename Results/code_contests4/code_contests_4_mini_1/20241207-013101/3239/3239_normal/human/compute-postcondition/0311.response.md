The statement `g[2] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the index 2 of the list `g`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1 and appended to the list `l`, so `j` will hold a value of at least 1. The previous state of the other variables is not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that is also divisible by 3; `f[2]` is false; `j` is at least 1; `l` has the previous values and now includes `j` as the last element; `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer that is also divisible by 3; `f[2]` is false; `j` is at least 1; `l` has the previous values plus `j`; `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
