Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer; if `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, it remains an odd integer not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 and is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1, while `l`, `j`, and `g[11]` remain unchanged.***
