The variable `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state indicates that `j` has already been increased by 1. Since the previous value of `j` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value assigned to `g[4]`. However, `g[4]` will hold the current value of `j`. The values of other variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `l` now includes the new value of `j`; `g[4]` is assigned the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `l` now includes the new value of `j`; `g[4]` is assigned the current value of `j`.**
