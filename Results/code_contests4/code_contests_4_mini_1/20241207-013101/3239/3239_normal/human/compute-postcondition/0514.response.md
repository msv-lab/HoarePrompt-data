The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so we can only state that `l.append(j)` adds the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The state of the list `l` is affected by this operation, but without knowing the previous values of `l` or `j`, we cannot specify the exact outcome. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`**
