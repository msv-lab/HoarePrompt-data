The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. Given that `j` is already increased by 1, the exact value of `j` is not known, but it is greater than its initial state. The variable `l` is affected by this operation. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
