The value of `j` is already increased by 1, but its specific previous value is unknown. The code `l.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. As a result, `l` is modified by adding the current value of `j` to it. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, and `l` now contains the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` now contains the value of `j`.**
