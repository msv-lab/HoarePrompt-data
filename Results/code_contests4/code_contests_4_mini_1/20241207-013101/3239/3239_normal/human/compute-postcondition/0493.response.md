According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1, which allows for another iteration of the loop. 

Since the `for` loop increments `i` by 1 on each iteration, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, the value of `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
