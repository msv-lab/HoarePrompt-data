Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is either [0] or [1], `f` is a list of twelve 0's, `g` is a list of twelve 0's where `g[3]` is 1 if `f[3]` is false, and `j` is 0 if `f[3]` is true or 1 if `f[3]` is false. The element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and is divisible by 5.***
