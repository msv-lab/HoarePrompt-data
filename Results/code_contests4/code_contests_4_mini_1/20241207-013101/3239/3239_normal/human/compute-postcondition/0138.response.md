The code assigns the value of `j` to the index `2` of the list `g`. The value of `j` is `1`, so `g[2]` will be updated to `1`. The previous value of `g[2]` was `0`, and now it is changed. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` is now [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is now 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
