Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is an odd integer divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is true, then `l` has `g[2]` appended to it. If `f[2]` is false, then `j` is at least 1; `l` has the previous values plus `j`; and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
