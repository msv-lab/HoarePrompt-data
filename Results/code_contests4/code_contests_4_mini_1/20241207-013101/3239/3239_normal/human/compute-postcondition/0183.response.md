The code `l.append(g[10])` appends the value of `g[10]` to the list `l`. In the given initial state, `g` is a list of twelve 0's, which means that `g[10]` is 0. The list `l` initially contains one element, which is 0, so after the execution of the code, `l` will now contain two elements: [0, 0]. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 0], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` remains a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.**
