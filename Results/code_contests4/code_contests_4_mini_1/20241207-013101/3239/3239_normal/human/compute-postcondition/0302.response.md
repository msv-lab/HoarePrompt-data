Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the first element of the list `a` at index `i` is even. If `f[1]` is true, `l` is updated to include `g[1]`. Otherwise, if `f[1]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains the value of `j` after incrementation, and `g[1]` is equal to `j`.***
