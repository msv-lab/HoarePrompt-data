Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13, and divisible by 17. If `f[7]` is true, `l` is updated by appending `g[7]`. If `f[7]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` is updated to include the new value of `j`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
