According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `i = 0` and ending at `i = n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. 

Given that `i` is currently `n - 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be `0` for the loop to start executing. Additionally, since `n` is returned by `func_1()`, it must be confirmed that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0 (for the loop to execute the first time)**
