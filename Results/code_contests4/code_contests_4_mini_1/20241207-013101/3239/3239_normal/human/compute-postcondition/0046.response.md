Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` contains either [0] or [1] based on the value of `f[4]`, the list `f` is updated where `f[4]` is incremented by 1, the list `g` may change if `f[4]` was false, `j` is updated to 0 if `f[4]` was true and becomes 1 if `f[4]` was false, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is an odd integer that is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5, and is divisible by 7 in both cases.**
