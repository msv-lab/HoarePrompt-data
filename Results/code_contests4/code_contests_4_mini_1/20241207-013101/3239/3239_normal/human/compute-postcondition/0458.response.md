The code `l.append(g[8])` attempts to append the value at index 8 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The impact of this code depends on the current state of the list `g`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the contents of `g` or `l`. Therefore, we cannot determine the value being appended or the changes to `l`.

Since `l` will have a new element added to it, but we don't know what that element is, we can only state that an element from `g` is being appended to `l`. There is no return value to note since the code simply modifies `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and an element from `g[8]` is appended to `l`.**
