Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, then `f[6]` is updated to true (or incremented by 1), while the states of `l` and `g[6]` remain undetermined. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, and if `a[i]` is divisible by 17, then `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 but divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is incremented by 1, with `g[9]`, `j`, and `l` remaining unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 23 but divisible by 29, then `f[10]` is incremented by 1, while `j`, `g[10]`, and `l` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is neither divisible by 29 nor 31, there are no changes made to `f[11]`.***
