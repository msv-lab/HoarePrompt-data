The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The value of `j` has been previously increased by 1, but the exact value of `j` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is an increased integer that is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is an increased integer that is appended to the list `l.**
