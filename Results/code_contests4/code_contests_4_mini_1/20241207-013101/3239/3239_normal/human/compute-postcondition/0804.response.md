The value of `f[4]` is incremented by 1. Since `f[4]` was previously true (which can be interpreted as a non-zero value), the condition `if f[4] is true` holds, meaning the list `l` will be appended with the value of `g[4]`. As a result, `j` remains unchanged, and `g[4]` retains its previous value. The variables that are affected are `f[4]` and `l`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `f[4]` is incremented by 1; `l` is appended with the value of `g[4]`; `j` is unchanged; `g[4]` is unchanged.
Output State: **`f[4]` is incremented by 1; `l` is appended with the value of `g[4]`; `j` is unchanged; `g[4]` is unchanged.**
