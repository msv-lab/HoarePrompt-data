Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, and divisible by 11. If `f[5]` is true, then `l` now contains the element `g[5]`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the value of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
