According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

Additionally, `n` must be greater than 2 in order for the loop to execute again. Since it is stated that `n` is at least 1, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
