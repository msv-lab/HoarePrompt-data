The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Since `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation, the output state reflects only the change in `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1**
