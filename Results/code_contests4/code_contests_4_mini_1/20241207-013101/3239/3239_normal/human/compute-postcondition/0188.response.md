The value of `f[10]` is incremented by 1. Since `f` remains [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the previous value of `f[10]` is 0, and after the increment, `f[10]` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `l` is now [0, 0] or [0, 1], `f` is now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], `g` is a list of twelve 0's, `j` is 0 or 1, and `i` is 1 for the second iteration.
