Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is divisible by 23, then `f[9]` is increased by 1; if `f[9]` was false, `j` is increased by 1, appended to the list `l`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is increased by 1; if `a[i]` is not divisible by 29 but is divisible by 31, then `f[11]` is increased by 1. The values of `l`, `j`, and `g[10]` remain undetermined in this case.***
