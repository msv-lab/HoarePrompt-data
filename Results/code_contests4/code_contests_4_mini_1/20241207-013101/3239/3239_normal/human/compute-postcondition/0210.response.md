The variable `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 from its previous state, and that updated value is now stored in `g[1]`. The list `l` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, and `g[1]` is assigned the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `g[1]` is assigned the new value of `j`.**
