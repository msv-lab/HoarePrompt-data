Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `a_i` are composite integers such that 4 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_4();`, `i` is 2. If `f[6]` is true, `g[6]` is appended to `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` now contains `j`, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
