According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The provided state indicates that `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` are defined, but they do not directly impact the execution of the loop. Thus, for the loop to execute, the key requirement is that `args` must contain at least 1 element. 

At the beginning of the loop, `x` needs to be assigned the first value from `args`. Therefore, we need to ensure `args` is a list or collection with at least one item, and `x` will be the first element.

State: **`sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty collection, and `x` is the first element of `args`**
