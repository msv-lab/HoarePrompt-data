The value of `j` is increased by 1 prior to this code snippet, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `l`. The state of the variable `l` is not known, so it will simply include the new value of `j` in it. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1 and the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1 and the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`**
