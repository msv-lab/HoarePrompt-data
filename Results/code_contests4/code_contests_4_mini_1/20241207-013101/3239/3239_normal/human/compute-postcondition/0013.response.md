The code `at_start = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. The previous state of `at_start` was already `False`, so there is no change in its value. The other variables `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `x` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to ' '; `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or defaults to `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty collection with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element of `args`, and `x` has been written to `file`.
