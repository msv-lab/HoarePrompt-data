The code `l.append(g[5])` appends the value at index 5 of the list `g` to the list `l`. The existing values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. However, the specific contents of `g` and `l` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact state of these variables after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and we append the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and we append the value of `g[5]` to the list `l`.**
