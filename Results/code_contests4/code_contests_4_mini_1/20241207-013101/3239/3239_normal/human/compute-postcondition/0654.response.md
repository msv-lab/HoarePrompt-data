The code `l.append(g[8])` appends the value at index `8` of the array `g` to the list `l`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `g[8]`, but it is assumed to be accessible. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the value from `g[8]` to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is at least 1 (returned by func_1()), `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in array `a` is odd, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, and the element at index `i` in array `a` is divisible by 19; value at `g[8]` is appended to `l`.**
