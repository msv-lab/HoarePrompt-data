Correctness: **False**.

The program has a couple of issues that prevent it from fulfilling the problem requirements correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). This will lead to a runtime error when trying to read card inputs.

2. **Missing Cards Logic**: The logic for determining missing cards is flawed. The program checks if a card exists in the dictionary using `if d[k][i]:`. This means that if a card is present, it continues to the next iteration. However, it does not handle the case where the card is not present properly. The correct logic should check for `if d[k][i] is None` instead. If `d[k][i]` is None, that means the card is missing, and it should print that card.

3. **Incorrect Main Check**: The condition `if __name__ == 'main':` should be `if __name__ == '__main__':`. This will cause the function `func_1()` not to run when the script is executed directly.

Due to these issues, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description and will fail for valid inputs. For example, if we provide the input as specified in the problem statement, the program will not run correctly and will not produce the expected output.
