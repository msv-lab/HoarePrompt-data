The dictionary `d` is created with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', and 'D', each assigned to a list of 13 `None` values. The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' each containing a list of 13 None values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52; `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' each containing a list of 13 None values.**
