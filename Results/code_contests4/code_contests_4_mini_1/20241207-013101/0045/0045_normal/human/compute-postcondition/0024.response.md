Postcondition: ***`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the current key being processed, and `i` is 2. If `d[k][i]` is true, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, maintaining that `i` must remain less than 13. If `d[k][i]` is false, the loop does not continue based on this condition.***
