According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, if `n` is 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
