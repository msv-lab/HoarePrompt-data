The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer constrained to the range 0 <= n <= 52. The function processes `n` lines of input, where each line contains a pair consisting of a character representing a suit ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D') and an integer representing a rank (1 to 13), ensuring that there are no duplicate cards. The function does not return any value explicitly stated in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (0 <= n <= 52) and processes `n` pairs of suits and ranks, ensuring no duplicate cards are present.**
