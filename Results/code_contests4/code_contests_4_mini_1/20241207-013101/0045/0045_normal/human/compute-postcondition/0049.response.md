The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; `i` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop since `i` is less than 13.
