Postcondition: ***`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; `i` is 1; if `d[k][i]` evaluates to true, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `d[k][i]` is false, no specific else action is defined, and the program will proceed without further specified behavior.***
