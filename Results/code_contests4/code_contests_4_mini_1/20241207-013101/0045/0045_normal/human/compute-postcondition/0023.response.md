The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the current key being processed, `i` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop where `i` must be less than 13.
