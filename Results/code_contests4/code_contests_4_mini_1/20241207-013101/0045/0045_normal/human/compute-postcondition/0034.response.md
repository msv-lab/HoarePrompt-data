The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The loop will proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop since `i` is less than 13.
