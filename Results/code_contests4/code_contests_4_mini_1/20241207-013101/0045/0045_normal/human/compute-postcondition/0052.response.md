According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than 13.

State: **`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; `i` is 2; the printed output is "D 2", for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 13**
