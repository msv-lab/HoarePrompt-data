The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is the current key being processed; `i` is 1; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
