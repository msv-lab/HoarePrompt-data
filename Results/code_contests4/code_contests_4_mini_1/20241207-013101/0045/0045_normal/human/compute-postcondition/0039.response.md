Postcondition: ***`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `d[k][i]` evaluates to True, the printed output is '%s %d' % (k, 3) and the execution continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `d[k][i]` evaluates to False, there is no output or action taken.***
