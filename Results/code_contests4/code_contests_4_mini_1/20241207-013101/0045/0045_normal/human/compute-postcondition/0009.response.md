In the provided code, `x` and `y` are assigned values from the `raw_input()` function, which takes user input and splits it into two components. The values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation since they are not involved in the assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variables `x` and `y` that hold the input values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are assigned input values from `raw_input()`**
