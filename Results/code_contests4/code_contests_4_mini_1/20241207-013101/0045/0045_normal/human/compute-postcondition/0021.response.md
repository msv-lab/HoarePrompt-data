The code snippet prints a formatted string that includes the current key `k` and the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is initially 1, so `i + 1` will be 2. The variable `k` holds the current key being processed, which can be one of 'S', 'H', 'C', or 'D'. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the current key being processed, `i` is 1, and the output will be the formatted string with `k` and 2.

Output State: **`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the current key being processed, `i` is 1, and the output is the formatted string '%s %d' % (k, 2)**.
