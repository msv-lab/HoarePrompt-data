The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop should be skipped, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; `i` is 0; and the value at `d[k][i]` is true (or non-zero), and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
