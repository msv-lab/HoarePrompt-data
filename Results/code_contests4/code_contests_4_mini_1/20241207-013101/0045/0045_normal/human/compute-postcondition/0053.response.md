The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; `i` is 2; and the loop will continue to the next iteration since `i` is less than 13.
