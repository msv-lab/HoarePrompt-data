The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; printed output is '%s %d' % (k, 3) and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
