According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be increased by 1 to 2. The loop can continue executing as long as `i` remains less than 13. 

State: **`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; printed output is '%s %d' % (k, 3)**
