Postcondition: ***`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; and `i` is 0. If the value at `d[k][i]` is true (or non-zero), the loop skips to the next iteration. If the value at `d[k][i]` is false (or zero), the loop will continue executing the current iteration.***
