According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` will be 1, it must be less than `n` for the loop to continue).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
