The code prints the formatted string using the values of `k` and `i + 1`. The variable `k` is 'D', and `i` is 1, so `i + 1` evaluates to 2. The output of the print statement will be "D 2". The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; `i` is 1; the printed output is "D 2".

Output State: **`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 'D'; `i` is 1; the printed output is "D 2".**
