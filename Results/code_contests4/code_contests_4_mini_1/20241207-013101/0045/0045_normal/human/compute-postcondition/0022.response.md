According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than 13. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than 13.

State: **`d` contains lists for each key ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D'), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the current key being processed, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 13**
