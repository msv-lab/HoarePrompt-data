The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (0 <= n <= 52) and reads `n` pairs of suits ('S', 'H', 'C', 'D') and ranks (1 to 13) from input, marking the corresponding indices in a dictionary as `True` for the suits. After processing the input, it prints out all the missing cards for each suit, indicating which ranks (1 to 13) are not marked as present based on the input. If `n` is 0, it simply outputs all ranks for all suits since no cards are read.
