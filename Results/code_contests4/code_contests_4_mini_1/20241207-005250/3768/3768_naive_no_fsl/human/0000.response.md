To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

The program aims to determine if three logos can completely fill a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving any empty space. The logos can be rotated, and the output should provide the dimensions of the billboard and the layout of the logos if it is possible to fit them.

However, let's examine some potential cases:

1. **Case where the total area exceeds the square**: For example, if we have logos with dimensions (3, 3), (4, 4), and (4, 4). The total area is 3*3 + 4*4 + 4*4 = 9 + 16 + 16 = 41. This cannot fit into any square billboard since the minimum side length of a square with area 41 would be ceil(sqrt(41)) = 7, and the total area is not a perfect square.

2. **Case with incompatible dimensions**: Consider logos with dimensions (1, 5), (2, 2), and (3, 3). The only way to fit them is in a square where the total dimensions allow for their combined area, which is 1*5 + 2*2 + 3*3 = 5 + 4 + 9 = 18. This would require a square of side length 5 (since sqrt(18) is less than 5), but there is no arrangement that allows them to fit without overlapping and without empty space.

3. **Case with a successful arrangement but incorrect implementation**: The program should validate that the logos can be arranged in every possible configuration, including rotations. For example, if we have (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2), the total area is 1*2 + 2*1 + 2*2 = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8, which fits into a square of side 4. However, the program might fail to find this arrangement if it does not consider all permutations and combinations effectively.

Upon examining the code, it seems focused on specific configurations and does not comprehensively check all arrangements and rotations for every possible combination of logos. The function `func_1` is structured in a way that may not cover all possible placements and rotations, leading to missed configurations that could fit within the square.

Given these considerations, we can conclude that the program does not handle all potential cases as outlined in the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
