Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the logos can be placed on the billboard without overlap and with no empty space. 

One potential case where the program fails is when the logos can fit on the billboard, but the implementation does not account for all possible arrangements and sizes. For example, consider the input:

```
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

In this case, each logo is 2x2, and they can fit perfectly in a 4x4 square billboard. However, the logic in the `func_1` function does not seem to handle the arrangement correctly. The program checks for specific conditions that may not cover all configurations of the logos.

Additionally, the code prints the wrong dimensions or arrangements sometimes, and after inspecting its logic, it is evident that there are multiple edge cases and configurations that are not captured properly, leading to incorrect outputs.

Therefore, the program does not comprehensively solve the problem as described, making it incorrect.
