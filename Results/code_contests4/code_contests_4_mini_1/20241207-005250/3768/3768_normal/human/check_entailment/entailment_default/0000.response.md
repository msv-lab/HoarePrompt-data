To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, we first need to understand what the program is supposed to do and whether it adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Description:
The program needs to determine whether three logos can fit perfectly on a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving any empty space. The dimensions of each logo can be rotated, and if it is not possible to fit all three logos, the program should output -1. If it is possible, it should print the size of the square billboard and the arrangement of the logos.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads six integers, which represent the dimensions of the logos.
   
2. **Functionality**:
   - The `func_1` function checks various configurations of the logos to see if they can fit into a square billboard. It checks combinations of heights and widths and attempts to fit the logos in different orientations.
   - The function prints the size of the square and the arrangement of the logos if they can fit.

3. **Output Conditions**:
   - If no configuration allows all logos to fit without overlapping and with no empty space, the program returns -1.

### Edge Cases:
- The current implementation may not handle the case where the total area of the logos does not match a perfect square area. For example, if the logos have dimensions such that their combined area is not a perfect square, the program may still attempt to fit them without checking the area condition first.
- Additionally, the code does not account for cases where the logos can be arranged differently than what is checked in the current configurations. There may be valid arrangements that are not being considered.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate that the function returns True under certain conditions based on the relationships between the dimensions. However, since the code relies heavily on specific configurations that may not cover all possible arrangements, the hints suggest that the program could miss valid configurations.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential edge cases where the total area is not a perfect square and the reliance on specific configurations, it is clear that the code does not adhere strictly to the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to ensure that the total area of the logos matches the area of a perfect square billboard, which can lead to incorrect outputs in scenarios where the logos cannot fit perfectly despite the configurations being checked.
