Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues that indicate the program is incorrect:

1. **Missing Cases**: The program only checks a limited number of conditions for placing the logos on the billboard. Specifically, it primarily relies on the relative sizes of the logos and their arrangement, which does not cover all possible configurations that could allow the logos to fit on a square billboard without empty spaces or overlapping. For example, it does not consider various orientations or arrangements of the logos beyond the stated conditions.

2. **Output Requirements**: The output format specified in the problem description requires the program to print the size of the square billboard and then fill it with characters in a clear rectangular arrangement. However, the program does not correctly implement the printing of the characters as required. It has incomplete and incorrect string manipulations (e.g., `print(str('A' * xa + 'B' * xb + '\n') * ya + str('C' * xc + 'B' * xb + '\n'` is syntactically incorrect and will lead to an error).

3. **Return Values**: The program returns `True` when it finds a set of conditions that match the dimensions, but it does not handle the case when it is impossible to place the logos correctly, which is required by the problem description to print `-1`. The logic for returning `False` at the end does not encompass all scenarios where fitting the logos might not be possible.

4. **No Comprehensive Validation**: The program lacks a comprehensive validation for various arrangements of the logos. For example, it does not check combinations where the logos can be rotated, nor does it check for cases where the sum of the areas of the logos does not equal the area of the square billboard.

Due to these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
