The code `print(ya)` outputs the current value of `ya`. Given the initial state, we know that `ya` is a positive integer and is greater than `yb`, while also being equal to `yb + yc`. Therefore, we can conclude that `ya` has a specific positive integer value based on the constraints provided. However, since no specific value is assigned to `ya` in the task, we will refer to it as a positive integer.

Output State: **`ya` is a positive integer**
