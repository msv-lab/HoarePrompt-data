Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the logos, where 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100. `ya` is less than `yb`, `xa` is not equal to `xc`, `ya + yc` is not equal to `xb`, and `ya` is equal to `yb`. The sum of `xa` and `xb` is not equal to `xc`, and the sum of `ya` and `yc` is not equal to `xb`. Additionally, `ya` is not equal to `yc` and the sum of `xa`, `xb`, and `xc` is not equal to `yc`.*
