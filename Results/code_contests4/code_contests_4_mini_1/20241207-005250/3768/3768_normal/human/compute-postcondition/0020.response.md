Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `xc`, and `yc` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the logos, where 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100. `ya` is greater than `yb`, `ya` is equal to `yb`, `xa` is not equal to `xc`, `ya + yc` is not equal to `xb`, the sum of `xa` and `xb` is not equal to `xc`, the sum of `ya` and `yc` is not equal to `xb`, `ya` is not equal to `yc`, the sum of `xa`, `xb`, and `xc` is not equal to `yc`, and it is not the case that `xa` is equal to `xc` and `ya + yc` is equal to `yb`. Additionally, `xb` is equal to `xc` and `yb + yc` is equal to `ya`.***
