Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `hand` is empty, we attempt to append `str[i]` to `hand`, but `str` is undefined. If `hand` is not empty and `str[i]` is equal to `hand[-1]` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `str[2]` is appended to `hand`. Otherwise, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, and `hand` is assigned the value at index 2 of an undefined string `str`.***
