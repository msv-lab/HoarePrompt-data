The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided definition. However, the constraints indicate that it operates on a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'C' and 'P', with a maximum length of 100 characters. The output behavior is not described, so we need to clarify the expected behavior based on the input parameters.

Assuming that the function processes this string input, it likely returns a result based on the contents of the string. However, since there's no information detailing the specific output, we can only summarize the input characteristics at this point.

Given the constraints, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'C' and 'P', with a length not exceeding 100 characters. The specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
