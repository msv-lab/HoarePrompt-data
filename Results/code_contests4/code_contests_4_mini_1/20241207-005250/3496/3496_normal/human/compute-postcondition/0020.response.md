Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. If the last character of `hand` matches `str[i]` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` contains one additional element `str[i]`. Otherwise, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `hand` is [str[1]].***
