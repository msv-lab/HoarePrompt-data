Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0, 1, or 2 and `i` is 2. If `str[i]` is equal to `hand[-1]` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` has `str[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, and `hand` is assigned the value at index 2 of an undefined string `str`.***
