Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. If `hand` is empty, then `hand` contains one element `str[i]`. If `hand` is not empty, and the last character of `hand` matches `str[i]` while the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` contains one additional element `str[i]`. Otherwise, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `hand` is set to contain only the element `str[1]`.***
