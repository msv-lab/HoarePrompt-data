Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the length of `hand` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` of `str` is equal to the last character of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` has a new element appended which is `str[i]`. Otherwise, if `str[i]` is not equal to `hand[-1]` or the length of `hand` is greater than or equal to 5, then `hand` is assigned the value of a list containing `str[i]`.***
