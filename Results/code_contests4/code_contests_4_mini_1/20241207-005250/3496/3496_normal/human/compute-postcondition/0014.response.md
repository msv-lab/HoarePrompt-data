Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. If `hand` is empty, the operation cannot be completed due to the undefined variable `str`. If `hand` has elements, and if the character at index `i` of `str` is equal to the last character of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `str[i]` is appended to `hand`. Otherwise, if `str[i]` is not equal to `hand[-1]` or the length of `hand` is greater than or equal to 5, `hand` is assigned the value of a list containing `str[i]`.***
