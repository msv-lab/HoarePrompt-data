`count` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is a non-empty string of 'C' and 'P', with a length not exceeding 100 characters; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `count` is 0.  
Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string of 'C' and 'P', with a length not exceeding 100 characters; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `count` is 0**.
