`hand` is a list that will have an element appended to it, specifically the string representation of the element at index `i` of the string `str`. Since `i` is 2, `hand.append(str[2])` will append `str[2]` to the list `hand`. The values of `count` and `n` do not change, as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `hand` has `str[2]` appended to it.

Output State: **`count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `hand` has `str[2]` appended to it.**
