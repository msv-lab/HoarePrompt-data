The variable `str` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which captures user input as a string. Since the input is specified to be a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'C' and 'P', the output state is: `str` is a non-empty string of 'C' and 'P', with a length not exceeding 100 characters.
