The function `func` processes a non-empty string consisting of the characters 'C' and 'P', with a length not exceeding 100 characters. It counts the number of segments of consecutive identical characters in the input string, with the following specific behavior: 

1. If the current character is the same as the last character added to the segment and the segment length is less than 5, it continues to add to the current segment.
2. If the current character is different from the last character or the segment length is already 5, it increments the segment count and starts a new segment with the current character.
3. After processing the string, it adds 1 to the count if there are any remaining characters in the last segment.

The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the final count of segments. An edge case to consider is when the input string has only one character, in which case it will still count it as one segment.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string of 'C' and 'P' characters, counts the number of segments of consecutive identical characters (with a maximum segment length of 5), and prints the total segment count. **
