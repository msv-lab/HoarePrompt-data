`n` is assigned the value of `len(str)`, which calculates the length of the non-empty string `str`. Since `str` has a length not exceeding 100 characters, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is a non-empty string of 'C' and 'P', with a length not exceeding 100 characters; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.

Output State: **`str` is a non-empty string of 'C' and 'P', with a length not exceeding 100 characters; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100**
