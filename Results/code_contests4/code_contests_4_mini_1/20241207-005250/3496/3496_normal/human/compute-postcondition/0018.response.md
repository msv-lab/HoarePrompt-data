The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` can be either 0 or 1, the new value of `count` can be either 1 or 2 after the execution. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0 or 1; `i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; and `count` is now either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`count` is 0 or 1; `i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `count` is now either 1 or 2**
