According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop is defined to iterate from `0` to `N-1`, which means it will execute if `N` is at least 1. Since `N` is given as a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), it is guaranteed to be at least 1. Additionally, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to `0` before the loop starts.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
