The variable `A` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on whitespace, and converts each string to an integer. The initial state mentions that `N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), and `i` is 2, but these values do not directly impact the execution of the `map` function or the input being processed. Since `N` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we don't have enough information about the input to determine the exact contents of `A`.

Therefore, we can conclude that `A` has been created but its specific values are unknown based on the input. The output state reflects that `A` is now a map object containing integers from the user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is 2, and `A` is a map object containing integers from user input**.
