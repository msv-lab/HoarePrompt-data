Functionality: ** The function reads integers N, M, and C, and a list B of M integers from input. It processes N lists A, each containing M integers, calculating the sum of products of corresponding elements from A and B for each list. If the sum of these products plus C is greater than 0, it increments a counter. Finally, it prints the count of how many times this condition was met across all N lists. The function does not accept parameters directly, and it could handle cases where the sum is exactly zero or negative, but only increments the counter when the sum exceeds zero. **
