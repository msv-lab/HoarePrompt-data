Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `B` is a list of `M` integers (-100 <= B[i] <= 100), and `A` is a list of `N` lists, each containing `M` integers (-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100), and `N`, `M`, `C` are assigned the values from the input.**
