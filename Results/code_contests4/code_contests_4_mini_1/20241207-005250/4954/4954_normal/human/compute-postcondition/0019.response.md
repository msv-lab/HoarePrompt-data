Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is `N-1`, `A` is a map object containing integers from user input for the last iteration, `tmp` is a list of products of corresponding elements from `A` and `B` for each index `m` in the range from 0 to `M-1`, and `ans` is the count of how many times the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0 after all `N` iterations.**
