Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is 2, `A` is a map object containing integers from user input, `tmp` is a list of products of corresponding elements from `A` and `B` for each index `m` in the range from 0 to `M-1`. If the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1.***
