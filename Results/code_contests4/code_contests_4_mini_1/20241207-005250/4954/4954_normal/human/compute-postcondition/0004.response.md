The variable `A` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it into parts, converts each part into an integer, and creates an iterable map object. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is 0, and `A` is an iterable of integers from user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is 0, `A` is an iterable of integers from user input**.
