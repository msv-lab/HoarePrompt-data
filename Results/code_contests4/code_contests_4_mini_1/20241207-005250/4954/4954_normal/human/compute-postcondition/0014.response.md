According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `N`, which means `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**.
