The code assigns the value of `B` to be the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input and converts it to integers. The variable `B` is assigned a list of integers based on the input provided. The states of the other variables (`N`, `M`, `C`, `A`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `A` is a list of `N` lists, each containing `M` integers, and `B` is a list of integers based on input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `M` is a positive integer (1 <= M <= 20), `C` is an integer (-100 <= C <= 100), `A` is a list of `N` lists, each containing `M` integers, `B` is a list of integers based on input.**
