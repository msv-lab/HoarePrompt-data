The code `A = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits the input string into separate values, and converts each value into an integer. The variable `A` is assigned a map object that contains these integers.

In this case, since `N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20) and `i` is initially 1, the state of `i` is not directly affected by this code. The initial state does not specify what the input will be, so the exact values that `A` will hold are unknown.

Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `A` is being assigned a collection of integers based on user input, while the values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 20), `i` is 1, and `A` is a map of integers from user input.**
