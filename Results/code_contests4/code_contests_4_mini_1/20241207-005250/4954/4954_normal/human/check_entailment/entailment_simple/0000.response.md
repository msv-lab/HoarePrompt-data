Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description due to the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. However, this is a minor issue that does not affect the logic of the program itself.

2. **Mapping Input**: The program uses `map(int, raw_input().split())` directly for `B` and `A`, which results in `B` being a map object rather than a list. This means that `B` will not behave as expected in the subsequent calculations. It should be converted to a list using `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `A`**: The program attempts to read `A` for each code but does not convert the `map` object into a list. This can lead to issues in accessing elements in `A` during the multiplication step since `tmp` is constructed using `A[m]` which assumes `A` is a list.

4. **Computation Logic**: The logic for calculating the result is correct, but due to the above issues with data types, it will not function as intended.

5. **Iterating Through Codes**: The program correctly iterates through each of the `N` pieces of code, but due to the issues mentioned, it may not give the correct output.

In conclusion, while the logic for calculating the number of codes that correctly solve the problem matches the problem description, the implementation has critical flaws that prevent it from functioning correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements as specified in the problem description.
