To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the goal and the implementation:

### Problem Description Analysis
The task is to find the number of distinct index triples (i, j, k) such that the product \(a[i] \cdot a[j] \cdot a[k]\) is minimized. This requires:
1. Finding the three smallest distinct numbers in the array.
2. Counting the number of ways to select indices for these numbers.

### Program Analysis
The provided program:
1. Reads the input and sorts the array.
2. It identifies the third smallest element (index 2 after sorting).
3. It counts how many times this third smallest element appears from index 3 onward.

### Issues in the Program
1. The program does not correctly account for cases where there are fewer than three distinct numbers in the input. This is crucial because if the smallest element is repeated sufficiently, the program may incorrectly return a count that does not represent valid index combinations.
2. The program assumes that the third element in the sorted array will always be part of the minimum product, which is not necessarily true if there are fewer than three distinct elements.

### Counterexample
Consider the input:
```
4
1 1 1 1
```
The correct output should be `4`, as there are 4 ways to choose indices (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), and (1, 2, 3).

Now consider the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the program would incorrectly calculate the number of indices as `1` for the element `3`, which does not account for the combinations of indices for the minimum product.

### Conclusion
The implementation does not correctly handle the requirement to find distinct indices for all valid combinations, particularly in cases where the minimum product comes from more than one element or when there are not enough distinct elements.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly compute the number of valid index triples (i, j, k) for cases where there are fewer than three distinct elements or when the minimum product can be formed differently.
