The program provided does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Counting Triples**: The problem requires the program to count the number of unique triples (i, j, k) such that the product `ai · aj · ak` is minimized. The program only counts how many times the third smallest element appears consecutively after sorting. This is insufficient because it fails to identify all unique combinations of three indices that yield the minimum product.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Product**: The program assumes that only the third smallest element is relevant for forming triples. However, to find the minimum product, the program should consider the smallest three distinct elements in the sorted array, and then calculate the possible combinations of those elements.

3. **Output**: The output of the program is not the number of triples, but merely the count of occurrences of the third smallest element. The expected output must be the count of unique index triples (i, j, k) that correspond to the minimum product, which is not what the program provides.

4. **Behavior for n < 4**: The program comments that it assumes `n` is at least 4, which contradicts the problem statement that `n` can be 3. This could lead to undefined behavior if the input does not meet this assumption.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
