The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and a list `a` of `n` positive integers (where each element satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000). It sorts the list `a` and counts the number of consecutive occurrences of the third smallest element (i.e., the element at index 2 after sorting) starting from that index. The function prints this count. If there are fewer than four elements in the input list, the behavior is not defined as it assumes `n` is at least 4.
