The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is `a[2]`, `ans` is 1, and the value of `a[3]` is not equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
