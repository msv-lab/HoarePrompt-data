`ans` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 1. Therefore, after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `a[2]`, `ans` is 2, and the value of `a[i]` is equal to `x`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `a[2]`, `ans` is 2, and the value of `a[i]` is equal to `x**
