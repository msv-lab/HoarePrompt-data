The code assigns the sorted version of the list `a` back to `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of positive integers, and after sorting, the order of the elements in `a` will change to be in non-decreasing order. The specific values of `a` are not known, but they will now be ordered.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of n positive integers where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.**
