`x` is assigned the value of the third element in the list `a` (since indexing starts at 0). The initial state indicates that `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, and therefore, `x` will take the value of `a[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of n positive integers where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `x` is a[2]**
