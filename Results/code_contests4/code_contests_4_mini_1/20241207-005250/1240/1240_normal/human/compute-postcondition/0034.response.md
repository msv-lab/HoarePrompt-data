Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 and `flag` is 0. If `a` is the character '/', then `flag` is updated to 1; otherwise, if `a` is a newline character (`'\n'`), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not a newline character, `count` is set to 1, `flag` remains 0, and `a` is still the first character read from standard input.***
