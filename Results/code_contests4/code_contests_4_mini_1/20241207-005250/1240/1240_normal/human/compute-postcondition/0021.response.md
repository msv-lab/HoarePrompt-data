Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 and `flag` is 0. If `a` is '/', then if `flag` is 0, `flag` is set to 1; otherwise, `flag` remains 0. If `a` is not '/', and if `a` is equal to '\n', the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a` is not equal to '\n' and also not equal to '/', then `count` is set to 1, `flag` remains 0, and `a` is written to standard output.***
