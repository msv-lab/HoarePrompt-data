Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `a` is an input character from standard input. If `a` is '/', then `count` remains 0 and `flag` is set to 1. If `a` is not '/', then if `a` is a newline character, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `count` is set to 1 while `flag` remains 0.***
