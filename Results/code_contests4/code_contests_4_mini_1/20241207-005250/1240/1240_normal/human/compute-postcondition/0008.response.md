The `pass` statement does not change the values of any variables. The existing values remain the same, and there is no effect on the program's state. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `flag` is 0, `a` is '/'; `flag` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `flag` is 0, `a` is '/'; `flag` is greater than 0**
