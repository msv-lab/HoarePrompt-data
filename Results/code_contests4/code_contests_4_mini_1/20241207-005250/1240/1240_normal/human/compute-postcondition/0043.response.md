The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and `a` is an input character from standard input.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `flag` is 0, and `a` is an input character from standard input**
