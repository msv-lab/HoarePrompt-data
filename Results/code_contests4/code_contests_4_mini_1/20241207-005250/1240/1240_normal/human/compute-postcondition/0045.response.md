The value of `flag` is assigned 0, which is its previous value. The values of the other variables, `count` and `a`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `flag` is 0, `a` is an input character from standard input. 

Output State: **`count` is 1, `flag` is 0, `a` is an input character from standard input**.
