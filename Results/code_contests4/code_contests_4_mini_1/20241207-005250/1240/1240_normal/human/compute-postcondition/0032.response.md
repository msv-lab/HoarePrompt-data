The code assigns the value `0` to `flag`, but `flag` already holds the value `0`. Therefore, there is no change to the value of `flag`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `flag` is 0, `a` is the first character read from standard input.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `flag` is 0, `a` is the first character read from standard input**
