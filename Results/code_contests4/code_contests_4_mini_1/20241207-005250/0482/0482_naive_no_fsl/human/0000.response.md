To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it correctly counts the number of subarrays with at least `k` equal integers for all possible cases.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Input**: The first line consists of two integers, `n` (the size of the array) and `k` (the minimum number of equal integers required in the subarrays). The second line contains `n` positive integers forming the array.
2. **Output**: The program should output a single integer representing the number of subarrays that contain at least `k` equal numbers.

### Analyzing the Provided Code:
1. The program uses a dictionary `d` to keep track of the indices of each integer in the array. 
2. It iterates through the array and updates the dictionary with the current index for each integer.
3. If the count of a particular integer reaches `k`, it updates `leftmost` to the index of the `k`-th occurrence of that integer.
4. The count of valid subarrays is updated by adding `leftmost + 1`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `k` is greater than the maximum frequency of any integer in the array**: The code might not correctly handle this case, as `leftmost` may never get updated to a valid index, resulting in an incorrect count.
2. **Minimum size edge case**: When `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `1` because the only subarray (the element itself) meets the condition. However, if the logic is flawed, it may not produce the correct output.
3. **All elements are the same**: For an input like `n = 5, k = 3` with all elements the same (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), the expected output would be `10` (the different combinations of subarrays).

### Testing the Edge Cases:
- For the case where `n = 5, k = 3` with the input `1 1 1 1 1`, the expected output is `10`, but the implementation might not correctly count all valid subarrays.
- For `n = 1, k = 1` with the input `1`, the expected output is `1`. If the implementation fails to handle a single element, it would produce an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues with the implementation where it may not count all valid subarrays correctly, especially in edge cases, we can conclude that the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
