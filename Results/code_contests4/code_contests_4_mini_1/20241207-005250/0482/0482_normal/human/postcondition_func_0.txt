The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, along with a list of `n` positive integers. It calculates and prints a count based on the occurrences of each integer in the list: if `k` is 1, it computes the sum of the first `n` integers; otherwise, it sums the indices of the `k`-th occurrences of each integer, updating the count based on the leftmost index of these occurrences. If there are fewer than `k` occurrences for any integer, it does not contribute to the count. The function does not return any value but prints the computed count.
