Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`. If `val` is in `d`, then `d[val]` is updated to include the index `i`, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, then the previous conditions hold. Otherwise, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the k-th last element from `dval`, and if `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to the value of `dvalk`. If `val` is not in `d`, then `d[val]` is initialized to `[i]`.***
