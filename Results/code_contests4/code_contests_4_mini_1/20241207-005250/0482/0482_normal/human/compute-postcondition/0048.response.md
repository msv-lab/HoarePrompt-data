Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `debug` remains unchanged; `vals` is a map object containing the first `n` integers read from input as integers. If `k` is equal to 1, then `count` is equal to `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Otherwise, `count` is equal to the total sum of `leftmost + 1` for each iteration, where `leftmost` is the largest index of the `k`-th occurrence of any value in `vals`, and `d` is a dictionary mapping each value in `vals` to the list of its indices. `leftmost` may be -1 or the index of the `k`-th occurrence of the value with the largest index. `vals` contains `n` integers.***
