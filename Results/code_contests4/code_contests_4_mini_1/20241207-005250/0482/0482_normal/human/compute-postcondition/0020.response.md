Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000 and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` (with `k` not equal to 1). `vals` contains at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, `val` is the first integer from `vals`, and `d[val]` now includes `0` in its list, with `dval` assigned the value of `d[val]`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, the program maintains this state; otherwise, if the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k` and the k-th last element of `dval` (denoted as `dvalk`) is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`.***
