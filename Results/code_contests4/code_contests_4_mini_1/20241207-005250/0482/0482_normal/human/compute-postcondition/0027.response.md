The value of `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. The variable `d` is a dictionary, and `val` is a key in this dictionary. The state of other variables (`count`, `vals`, `i`) is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`.**
