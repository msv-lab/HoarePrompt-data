Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `debug` remains unchanged; `vals` is a map object containing the first `n` integers read from input as integers; `count` is either `n * (n + 1) / 2` if `k` is equal to 1, or the total sum of `leftmost + 1` for each iteration otherwise.**
