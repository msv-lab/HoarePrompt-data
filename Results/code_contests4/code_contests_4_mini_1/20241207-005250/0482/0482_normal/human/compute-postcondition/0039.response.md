The values of the variables do not change, but the `pass` statement indicates that no operation is performed at this point in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least one more element than the current index `i`, and `d[val]` is updated to include the index `i`; `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`.
