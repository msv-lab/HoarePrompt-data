`dvalk` is assigned the value of the k-th last element of `dval`, which is indicated by `dval[-k]`. Given that `dval` has a length greater than or equal to `k`, this operation is valid. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is not equal to 1; `vals` contains at least 1 integer; `i` is 0; `val` is the first integer from `vals`; `d[val]` now includes `0` in its list; `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`; the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dvalk` is the k-th last element of `dval`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is not equal to 1; `vals` contains at least 1 integer; `i` is 0; `val` is the first integer from `vals`; `d[val]` now includes `0` in its list; `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`; the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dvalk` is the k-th last element of `dval`.**
