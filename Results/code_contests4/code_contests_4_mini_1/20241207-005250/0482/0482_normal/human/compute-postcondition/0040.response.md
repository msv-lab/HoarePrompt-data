The code assigns `dvalk` the value of the element located at index `-k` from the list `dval`. This effectively retrieves the k-th last element from `dval`. The previous values of `dval` and `k` are necessary to determine the value of `dvalk`, but since the specific values are not provided, we cannot specify an exact output for `dvalk`. However, we can state that the previous value of `dval` must contain at least `k` elements for this operation to be valid.

Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least one more element than the current index `i`, `d[val]` is updated to include the index `i`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, and `dvalk` is assigned the k-th last element from `dval`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least one more element than the current index `i`, `d[val]` is updated to include the index `i`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the k-th last element from `dval`.**
