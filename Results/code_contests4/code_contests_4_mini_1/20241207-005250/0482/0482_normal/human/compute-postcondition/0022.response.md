The code assigns a list containing the current value of `i` to the dictionary `d` with the key `val`. The initial state indicates that `val` is the first integer from `vals`, and it is not present in the dictionary `d`. The value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `d` will now have a new entry with `val` as the key and a list containing the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is not equal to 1; `i` is 0; `val` is the first integer from `vals`; `d` now contains `d[val] = [0]`**
