Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least one more element than the current index `i`, `d[val]` is updated to include the index `i`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the k-th last element from `dval`, and if `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`.***
