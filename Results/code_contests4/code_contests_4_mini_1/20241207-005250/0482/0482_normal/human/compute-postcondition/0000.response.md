Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 1,000,000,000; `debug` is assigned the value False or True depending on whether 'DEBUG' is in `os.environ`.**
