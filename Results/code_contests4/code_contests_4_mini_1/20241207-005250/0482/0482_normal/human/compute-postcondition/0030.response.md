The value of `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`. The previous state indicates that `dvalk` has been previously assigned a value from the `dval` list, specifically the `-k` index element. The variables `count`, `vals`, `i`, `dval`, and `dvalk` remain unchanged by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, and `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`, `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` must have at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`, `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`**.
