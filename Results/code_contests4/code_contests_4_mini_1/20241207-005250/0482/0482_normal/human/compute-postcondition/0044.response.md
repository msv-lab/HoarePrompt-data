The variable `d` is assigned a new key `val` with the value `[i]`. This means that for the key `val`, the list now contains the current index `i`. The values of `count`, `leftmost`, and `vals` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `d` is modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, and `d[val]` is now `[i]`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, and `d[val]` is now `[i]`**
