The value of `count` is incremented by `leftmost + 1`. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it is increased by the amount of `leftmost + 1`. The states of the other variables (`leftmost`, `d`, `val`, `i`, `dval`, `k`, and `dvalk`) are not affected by this specific line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`**
