According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `vals` object. Since `vals` is a map object containing the first `n` integers read from input as integers, it must have at least one element for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000), and since `k` is greater than or equal to 1 but not equal to 1, the first iteration will use `i = 0` and `val` will be the first integer from `vals`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `vals` must contain at least one integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is not equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `vals` contains at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, `val` is the first integer from `vals`**
