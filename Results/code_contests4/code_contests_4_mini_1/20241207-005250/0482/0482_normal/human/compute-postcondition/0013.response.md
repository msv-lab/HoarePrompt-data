Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is not equal to 1; `vals` contains at least 1 integer; `i` is 0; `val` is the first integer from `vals`; `d[val]` now includes `0` in its list; `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. The length of `dval` is less than `k`.***
