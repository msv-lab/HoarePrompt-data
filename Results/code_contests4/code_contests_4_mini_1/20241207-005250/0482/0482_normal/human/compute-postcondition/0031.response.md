Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` has at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, and `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`. If `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to the value of `dvalk`.***
