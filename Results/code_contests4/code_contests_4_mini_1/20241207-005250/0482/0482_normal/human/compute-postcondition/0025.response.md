According to the code, the loop will execute based on the length of the `vals` list. If `vals` has more elements than the current index `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` has been increased by `leftmost + 1`, and `i` is equal to the current index of the iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `val` will become the next element in the `vals` list. 

The program state indicates that there must be at least `i + 1` elements in `vals` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `vals` must have at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1**
