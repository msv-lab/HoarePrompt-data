Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000 and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` (with `k` not equal to 1). If `val` is in `d`, then `d[val]` includes `0` in its list, and if the length of `d[val]` is less than `k`, the program maintains this state; otherwise, if the length of `d[val]` is greater than or equal to `k` and the k-th last element of `d[val]` (denoted as `dvalk`) is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is assigned the value of `dvalk`. If `val` is not in `d`, then `d[val]` is initialized to `[0]`.***
