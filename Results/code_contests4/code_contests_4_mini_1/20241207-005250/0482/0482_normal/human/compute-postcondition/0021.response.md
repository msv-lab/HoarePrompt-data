Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is not equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `vals` contains at least 1 integer, `i` is 0, and `val` is the first integer from `vals`. The value of `val` is not present in the dictionary `d`.***
