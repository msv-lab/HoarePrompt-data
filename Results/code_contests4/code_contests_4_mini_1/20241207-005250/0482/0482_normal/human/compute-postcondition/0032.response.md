Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` has at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, and `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, the function proceeds with the previous updates. Otherwise, `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`, and if `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to the value of `dvalk`.***
