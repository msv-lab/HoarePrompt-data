The variable `d[val]` is updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list contained in `d[val]`. Since `val` is the first integer from `vals` and is an element of `d`, this operation modifies the list at key `val` in dictionary `d` by adding `0` to it. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `vals`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 400,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is not equal to 1; `vals` contains at least 1 integer; `i` is 0; `val` is the first integer from `vals`; `d[val]` now includes `0` in its list.**
