Postcondition: ***`count` is increased by `leftmost + 1`, `vals` has at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is incremented by 1. If `val` is in `d`, then `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, and if the length of `dval` is less than `k`, the previous updates proceed. Otherwise, `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`, and if `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost`, then `leftmost` is updated to `dvalk`. If `val` is not in `d`, then `d[val]` is assigned the value `[i]`.***
