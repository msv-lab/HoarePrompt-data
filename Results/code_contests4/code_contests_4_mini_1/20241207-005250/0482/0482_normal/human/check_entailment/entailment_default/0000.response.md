To assess the correctness of the given Python program, we will analyze both the problem description and the code provided.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of subarrays in an array of integers that contain at least `k` equal numbers. 

### Code Analysis:
The code uses a dictionary `d` to keep track of the indices of occurrences of each integer. If `k` is 1, it calculates the total number of subarrays using the formula for the sum of the first `n` integers, which is correct since every subarray will contain at least one occurrence of any number.

For `k > 1`, the code iterates through the array and updates the count based on the `k`-th occurrence of each integer. It checks if the current value already exists in the dictionary and updates the leftmost index accordingly.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Element Array:** If `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `1`, which the code handles correctly.
2. **All Elements Unique:** If `n = 5` and `k = 2` with all unique elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), the output should be `0` since no subarray can have at least 2 equal numbers. The code should handle this correctly.
3. **Multiple Equal Elements:** For an array like `[1, 1, 1, 1]` with `k = 3`, the correct output should be `4` (subarrays: `[1,1,1]`, `[1,1,1,1]`, `[1,1]`, and `[1,1]`), which the code should calculate correctly.

Overall, the logic seems correct, but we need to focus on whether it handles all potential cases, including edge cases where the count might not be updated correctly.

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that if `k` is 1, it computes the total number of subarrays, which matches our analysis. For `k > 1`, it states that the function sums the indices of the `k`-th occurrences, updating the count based on the leftmost index. This matches the code's logic.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the code appears to handle the problem description correctly, including edge cases. 

However, there's a potential issue: when a number has fewer than `k` occurrences, the code does not check if `leftmost` should remain unchanged, which could lead to incorrect counts if not properly managed.

**Correctness: False.**

### Explanation:
For instance, if the input is:
```
5 3
1 2 1 1 3
```
The expected output is `2` as there are only two valid subarrays. However, depending on how `leftmost` is updated, it might not correctly count the first occurrence of `1` since it relies on updating only when it has `k` occurrences, possibly missing valid subarrays that can be counted. This flaw indicates that the code does not reliably follow the problem description for every potential case.
