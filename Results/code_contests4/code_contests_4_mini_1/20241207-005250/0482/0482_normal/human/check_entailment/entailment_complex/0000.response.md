The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for counting subarrays with at least \( k \) equal numbers.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Counting Mechanism**: The program attempts to track occurrences of each number in the list using a dictionary with lists of indices. However, it does not correctly calculate the number of subarrays that contain at least \( k \) equal numbers. The logic used to update `count` based on `leftmost` is flawed as it does not account for how many subarrays can be formed given the occurrences of the current number.

2. **Handling of Count Calculation**: The way `count` is computed does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement. The sum of indices where the \( k \)-th occurrence happens does not equate to the total number of subarrays that meet the criteria. Instead, the program needs to count all subarrays that can be created using the occurrences of each element.

3. **Special Case of \( k = 1 \)**: While the program handles the case where \( k = 1 \) by calculating the total number of subarrays (which is \( n(n + 1)/2 \)), this is not sufficient for all cases of \( k \). The logic for \( k > 1 \) is not properly implemented.

### Example Where It Fails:
For the input:

```
5 3
1 2 1 1 3
```

The expected output is `2`, representing subarrays that contain at least three `1`s: `[1, 2, 1, 1]` and `[1, 2, 1, 1, 3]`. However, due to the incorrect logic for calculating `count`, the program may output an incorrect value.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect implementation of the counting logic and how subarrays are evaluated, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
