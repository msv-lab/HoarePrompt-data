To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in relation to the problem description.

The program aims to determine whether it is possible to perform operations on the heights of squares such that they form a non-decreasing sequence. The allowed operations are either to decrease the height of a square by 1 or to leave it unchanged.

### Key Points from the Code:
1. The code reads the number of squares `n` and their respective heights.
2. It iterates through the heights in reverse order (from right to left).
3. It maintains a `last` variable, which stores the minimum height allowed for the current square to ensure a non-decreasing order.
4. If the current height is greater than `last`, it checks the difference. If the difference is greater than 1, it outputs "No" and exits.
5. It updates `last` to the minimum of `last` and the current height.

### Analyzing the Logic:
The logic essentially checks if any square is taller than the square to its right by more than 1. If such a case is found, it outputs "No" since it wouldn't be possible to adjust the heights within the allowed operations to achieve a non-decreasing order.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. All squares are of the same height: The program should handle this correctly, outputting "Yes."
2. Heights are already in non-decreasing order: Again, the program should output "Yes."
3. A height is exactly 1 unit taller than the next one: The program will output "Yes" since we can decrease it by 1.
4. A height is 2 units taller than the next one: The program will output "No," which is correct.
5. Single square case: The program should output "Yes" since there are no comparisons to make.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program against the problem description and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the heights can be made non-decreasing. It handles all edge cases as expected.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly checks for the non-decreasing condition after possible operations on the heights, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
