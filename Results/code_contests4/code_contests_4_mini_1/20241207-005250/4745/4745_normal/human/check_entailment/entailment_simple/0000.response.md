To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have a sequence of squares with heights represented by an array.
2. We can either decrease the height of a square by 1 or do nothing.
3. The goal is to make the heights of the squares non-decreasing from left to right.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of squares and then reads a list `arr` of heights.
2. It initializes `last` as the height of the last square.
3. The program iterates over the squares from right to left:
   - If the current height `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, it calculates the difference `d = arr[i] - last`.
   - If `d > 1`, it prints 'No' and exits, indicating that it is not possible to adjust the heights to be non-decreasing, since we can only decrease by 1 at most.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to `last`, it updates `last` to be the smaller of the two, which allows for the possibility of decreasing heights.

### Validity of the Approach:
- The approach is valid because:
  - By checking from right to left, the program ensures that each square's height can either remain the same or decrease to maintain the non-decreasing order.
  - The condition `if d > 1` accurately captures the scenario where more than one decrease would be needed to make the sequence valid, which is impossible with the allowed operations.
  
### Edge Cases:
- For input such as `1 2 1 1 3`, the program correctly determines that it's possible to adjust the heights to be non-decreasing.
- For input `1 3 2 1`, it correctly identifies that it's impossible to make the heights non-decreasing since the heights would need to be decreased in a way that exceeds the allowed operations.
- The program also correctly handles single square inputs, as there is nothing to compare against.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the logic correctly as per the problem description. It efficiently checks the conditions and handles the constraints appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
