To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it meets the requirements outlined.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if we can make the heights of the squares non-decreasing by either decreasing the height of any square by 1 or doing nothing. 

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`.
2. **Logic for Non-Decreasing Check**:
   - It starts from the last element of the array and moves backward.
   - It keeps track of the last height encountered (`last`).
   - For each height `arr[i]`, it checks:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, it calculates the difference `d`.
     - If `d` is greater than 1, it prints 'No' and exits.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it updates `last` to the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program effectively checks if we can reduce the heights to ensure they are non-decreasing.
- It allows heights to decrease by at most 1, which is consistent with the operations allowed (decrease by 1 or do nothing).
- The logic ensures that if any height is more than 1 greater than the previous one (in the reversed order), it cannot be made non-decreasing with the allowed operations, hence it prints 'No'.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases like:
   - A single height (always returns 'Yes').
   - Heights that are already non-decreasing (returns 'Yes').
   - Heights that require reductions to meet the non-decreasing requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic dictated by the problem description. It checks the necessary conditions and correctly determines if the heights can be adjusted to be non-decreasing.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
