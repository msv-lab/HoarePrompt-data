The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a list of integers `H`. It checks if the array `H` satisfies a specific condition: for every element in the array, it ensures that there are no elements that are more than 1 greater than the minimum value encountered so far when traversing the array from the last element to the first. If any such condition is violated, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
