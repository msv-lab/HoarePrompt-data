According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop iterates from `N - 1` down to `0`, which means it will execute if `N` is at least `1`. Since `N` is a positive integer within the range of `1` to `10^5`, it will always allow the loop to execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, the variable `last` represents the last element of `arr`, which is `arr[N - 1]`. The variable `i` will start at `N - 1` and will decrement to `0` in the loop. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` starts at `N - 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5, `last` is `arr[N - 1]`, `i` is `N - 1`**
