The `exit(0)` command is executed, which terminates the program. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will stop running at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 3`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`; output is 'No' and the program exits.

Output State: **`last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 3`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`; output is 'No' and the program exits.**
