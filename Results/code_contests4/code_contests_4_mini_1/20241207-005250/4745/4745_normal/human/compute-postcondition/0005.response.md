The variable `d` is assigned the value of `arr[i] - last`. Given that `i` is `N - 1`, it follows that `arr[i]` is `arr[N - 1]`. Therefore, `d` is calculated as `arr[N - 1] - last`. Since `last` is defined as `arr[N - 1]`, we have:

``` 
d = arr[N - 1] - arr[N - 1] 
d = 0
```

The states of other variables (`N`, `last`, and `i`) are unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is `arr[N - 1]`; `i` is `N - 1`; `d` is 0.**
