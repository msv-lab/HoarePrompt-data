The code assigns `arr` a list of integers obtained from a single line of input, where the input is read using `stdin.readline()` and then split into separate values before being mapped to integers. The variable `N` remains unchanged, but `arr` will now hold the integers provided in the input. Since `n` is an input integer and does not affect the values in `arr`, we can only state the relationship based on the input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
