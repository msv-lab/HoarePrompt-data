Postcondition: ***`last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`, where `i` is `N - 3`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`. If `d` is greater than 1, the output is 'No' and the program exits. If `arr[i]` is not greater than `last`, there are no changes made to the output or the state of the program.***
