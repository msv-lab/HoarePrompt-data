To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `i` is initialized to `N - 2`, meaning it is set to a value that is at least `-1` (since `N` is at least 1).
2. The variable `last` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `arr[i]`.
3. The code snippet calculates `d` as `arr[i] - last`.

Since we don't have specific values for `last` or `arr[i]`, we can only state their relationships based on the conditions provided.

The output state will reflect that `d` is computed based on the difference between the value at index `i` of `arr` and the variable `last`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 2`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`.**
