Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 2`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`, and if `d` is greater than 1, the program exits. If `arr[i]` is not greater than `last`, no changes occur.***
