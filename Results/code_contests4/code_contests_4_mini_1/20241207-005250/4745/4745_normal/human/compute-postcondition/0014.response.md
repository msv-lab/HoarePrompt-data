The code snippet is a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. It does not alter any variables or their values. The values of `N`, `last`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 2`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`, and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 2`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`, and the output is 'No'**.
