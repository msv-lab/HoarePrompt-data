The code uses `print('No')`, which outputs the string 'No' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables as they were before the print statement, along with the output of the print function.

Output State: **`last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 3`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`; output is 'No'**.
