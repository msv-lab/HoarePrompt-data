The code `exit(0)` is a command that terminates the execution of the program immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, but the program exits. The previous values of the affected variables are still relevant for understanding the context before the termination.

The Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`; `i` is `N - 2`; `d` is calculated as `arr[i] - last`; and the program exits with no further output or changes.
