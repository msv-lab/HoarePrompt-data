To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we note that the loop iterates from `N - 1` down to `0`. The variable `last` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum of its current value and `arr[i]`. If at any point `arr[i]` is greater than `last` by more than 1, the program will print 'No' and exit. However, since we are asked to focus on the state after the loop completes, we will assume that no such exit condition was met.

After all iterations are complete:

- The loop iterates over all elements of `arr` starting from the last element down to the first.
- The variable `last` will ultimately hold the minimum value found in `arr` due to the repeated updates.
- The index `i` will end at `-1` after the loop finishes, indicating that it has processed all elements.

Considering these points, we can conclude the final state as follows:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is the minimum value of `arr`; `i` is -1.**
