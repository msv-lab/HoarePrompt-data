According to the code, the for loop iterates from `N - 1` down to `0`. The loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1, making `i` equal to `N - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is still non-negative.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5, `last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`, `i` is `N - 2` for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.**
