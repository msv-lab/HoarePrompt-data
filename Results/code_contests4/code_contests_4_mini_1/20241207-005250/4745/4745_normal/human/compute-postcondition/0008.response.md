The `exit(0)` statement is invoked, which immediately terminates the program without altering any variable states. The values of `N`, `last`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged. The program will exit with a status code of 0, indicating successful termination, but the output message is 'No'. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is `arr[N - 1]`; `i` is `N - 1`; `d` is 0; `d` is greater than 1; and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 10^5; `last` is `arr[N - 1]`; `i` is `N - 1`; `d` is 0; `d` is greater than 1; and the output is 'No'.**
