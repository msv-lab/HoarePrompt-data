According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `N - 3`. 

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `0`. 

State: **`last` is the minimum of `last` and `arr[i]`, `i` is `N - 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
