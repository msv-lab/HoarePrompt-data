Let's analyze the given program step by step according to the problem description.

### Problem description:
We need to determine if we can modify the heights of squares in such a way that they form a non-decreasing sequence. The operations we can perform are either decreasing the height of a square by 1 or doing nothing.

### Program:
```python
n = int(stdin.readline())
arr = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
last = arr[n - 1]
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if arr[i] > last:
        d = arr[i] - last
        if d > 1:
            print('No')
            exit(0)
    last = min(last, arr[i])
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of squares `n` and their heights `arr`.
2. It initializes `last` with the height of the last square.
3. It iterates through the heights from right to left:
   - If the current height `arr[i]` is greater than `last`, it checks the difference `d`. If `d > 1`, it prints 'No' and exits.
   - It then updates `last` to the minimum of itself and `arr[i]`.

### Key Observations:
- The program effectively checks if any height exceeds the next height by more than 1 (since we can only decrease by 1).
- If a height is greater than the next one by more than 1, we cannot adjust it to fit into a non-decreasing sequence.
- The program updates `last` to the minimum height seen so far, ensuring that it can check the next height against this updated value.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case with all heights the same:** For example, if `arr = [2, 2, 2]`, the output should be 'Yes'. The program correctly identifies that no heights need to be adjusted.
2. **Case with maximum input values:** If we check `arr = [1000000000]`, the output should be 'Yes', which the program handles correctly.
3. **Case with descending heights, where the difference is exactly 1:** For example, `arr = [3, 2, 1]` should return 'No' since we cannot make `3` less than `2` in one operation.
4. **Edge where two heights differ by exactly 1:** For example, `arr = [1, 2]` should return 'Yes' as we can leave them as is.

### Example where it fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
4 2 1
```
The program would check:
- `1 < last (2)` → update `last` to `1`.
- `2 < last (1)` → this should yield 'No' since `arr[1]` is not greater than `last`. However, it requires checking if we can only decrease by one and cannot meet the non-decreasing requirement.

The program would output 'Yes' incorrectly, as we cannot adjust `4` to be non-decreasing with `2` and `1`.

### Final Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Therefore, it is possible to find inputs where it fails to satisfy the condition described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**.
