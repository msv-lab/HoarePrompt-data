The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it is implied that there is an internal handling of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 25. However, since the function does not explicitly take `n` as an input parameter, the functionality cannot be defined in terms of input parameters and their relationships. Therefore, we can only state that the function likely operates within the context of this constraint internally.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates within the constraint that n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 25.**
