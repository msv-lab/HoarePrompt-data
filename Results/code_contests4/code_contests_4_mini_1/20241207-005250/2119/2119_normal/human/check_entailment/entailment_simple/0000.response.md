Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` directly, but it does not convert the input into an integer. The input should be explicitly converted to an integer to match the expected data type.

2. **Indexing Issue**: The program attempts to access an index of a list with `input() - 10`. This assumes the value of `n` will always fall within the range that allows for valid indexing. However, if `n` is less than 10, it will lead to an invalid index (negative index) or out-of-bound errors, which is not handled.

3. **Logic of Card Values**: The hardcoded list `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements for determining how many cards can be drawn to achieve a specific total with the first card being the queen of spades (10 points). The logic used in this list does not account for all possible values of `n` properly, especially given the different combinations of cards that could yield valid results.

4. **Lack of Flexibility**: The program is hardcoded to return specific values based on the difference between `n` and 10. This does not generalize well for all potential cases as stated in the problem description.

In conclusion, the program does not cover all possible cases nor does it implement the rules of blackjack as per the problem description. It lacks proper input handling and logical computation to determine the correct number of ways to achieve the desired points with the second card.
