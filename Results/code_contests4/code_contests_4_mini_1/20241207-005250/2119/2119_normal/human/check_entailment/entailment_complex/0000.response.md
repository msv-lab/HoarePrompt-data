The provided program is designed to calculate the number of ways to draw a second card in blackjack such that the sum of the points equals a given value \( n \), given that the first card is the queen of spades, which has a value of 10 points.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function does not accept parameters and reads input directly from the user, which is expected to be an integer \( n \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 25 \).
  
2. **List Indexing**: The list `print[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` is indexed using `input() - 10`. This means:
   - If \( n = 10 \): The index accessed is \( 10 - 10 = 0 \), which returns `0` (no valid second card).
   - If \( n = 11 \): The index accessed is \( 11 - 10 = 1 \), which returns `4` (four 2s).
   - If \( n = 12 \): The index accessed is \( 12 - 10 = 2 \), returning `4` (four 2s).
   - If \( n = 13 \): The index is \( 3 \), returning `4` (four 3s).
   - Continuing this way, up to \( n = 25 \), the program correctly identifies the number of valid cards based on the expected output described in the problem statement.

3. **Index Limitations**: The list only has 17 elements, meaning valid indices are from \( 0 \) to \( 16 \). For \( n > 25 \), the program would raise an `IndexError`, which is outside the problem description's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the number of valid second cards for all valid inputs \( n \) from \( 1 \) to \( 25 \), according to the problem description. Even though it does not handle invalid inputs gracefully (it assumes valid input), the specification states \( 1 \leq n \leq 25 \), which the program complies with as long as the input adheres to this constraint.

Therefore, since the program behaves as required for all valid inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
