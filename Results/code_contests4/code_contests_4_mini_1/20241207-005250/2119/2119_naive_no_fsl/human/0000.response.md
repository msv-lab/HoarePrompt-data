To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description.

The problem description states that the player has the queen of spades (which is worth 10 points) and needs to find the number of ways to draw a second card such that the total points equal a given number \( n \). The card values and their corresponding point values are as follows:
- Cards from 2 to 10 are worth their face values (2 to 10 points).
- Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points each.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.

From the problem description, we know how many cards can yield each possible total when the first card is a queen (10 points). The key points are:
- For \( n < 10 \), it's impossible to reach \( n \) with one queen as the second card since the minimum card value is 2. Thus, the output should be 0.
- For \( n = 10 \), the only way to achieve this is if the second card is an Ace worth 1 point, which is not possible since the Ace would not exist in the deck when the first card is the queen of spades. Thus, output should be 0.
- For \( n = 11 \) to \( 19 \), the valid second cards would be the cards worth \( n - 10 \) points. Each value (from 2 to 9) would have 4 suits available.
- For \( n = 20 \), the valid second cards would be the tens, jacks, queens, and kings. Excluding the queen of spades, there are 15 valid cards.
- For \( n > 20 \), the output should be 0 as there are no cards that can make the sum exceed 20 with the queen already contributing 10 points.

Now, letâ€™s analyze the code:

```python
print[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0][input() - 10]
```

The program uses a list to directly index based on the input \( n \) after subtracting 10. This means:
- For \( n = 1 \), index -9 (out of range) -> Error
- For \( n = 2 \), index -8 -> Error
- ...
- For \( n = 10 \), index 0 -> Output 0 (correct)
- For \( n = 11 \), index 1 -> Output 4 (correct)
- For \( n = 12 \), index 2 -> Output 4 (correct)
- ...
- For \( n = 20 \), index 10 -> Output 15 (correct)
- For \( n = 21 \), index 11 -> Output 4 (incorrect, should be 0)
- For \( n = 22 \), index 12 -> Output 0 (correct)
- For \( n = 23 \), index 13 -> Output 0 (correct)
- For \( n = 24 \), index 14 -> Output 0 (correct)
- For \( n = 25 \), index 15 -> Output 0 (correct)

The code does not handle cases where \( n < 10 \) correctly as it will attempt to access negative indexes, which is an error. Additionally, for \( n = 21 \), it incorrectly returns 4 instead of 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when \( n < 10 \) and gives incorrect outputs for \( n = 21 \).

Correctness: **False**
