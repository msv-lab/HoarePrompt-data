The provided program aims to determine the number of ways to get a second card in blackjack such that the sum of points equals a given value \( n \), given that the first card is the queen of spades which is worth 10 points.

The program uses a static list to return results based on the input \( n \) adjusted by subtracting 10 (the value of the queen). The list is defined as follows:

```python
print[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0][input() - 10]
```

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **List Indexing**: The list has 17 elements indexed from 0 to 16. The input value \( n \) can range from 1 to 25, so the expression `input() - 10` will produce indexes ranging from -9 to 15. 
2. **Out of Bounds**: For inputs \( n \) less than 10 (which translates to indices less than 0), it will lead to an `IndexError` because Python does not handle negative indices in this context.
3. **Correct Handling of Valid Cases**: For valid cases (where \( n \) is between 10 and 25), the program will correctly return the number of ways to achieve the required sum based on the predefined logic.

### Example of a Failing Case:
- For \( n = 9 \), the program tries to access `-1` in the list, which leads to an `IndexError`.
- Similarly, for \( n = 1 \) through \( n = 9 \), it will also cause an error.

As a result, the program fails to handle cases where \( n < 10 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to its inability to handle all potential input cases without errors.

Correctness: **False**.
