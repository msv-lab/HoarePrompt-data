Postcondition: ***`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `tem[i]` is not '9', then `tem[i]` is the incremented string value of its previous integer representation, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
