`tem[i]` is updated by converting its current value (which is a string) to an integer, adding 1 to it, and then converting it back to a string. Since `tem[i]` was previously updated to '0', it will now become '1'. Other variables `L`, `A`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `tem[i]` is '1'.

Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `tem[i]` is '1'**
