The code assigns the value '0' to `tem[i]`, where `i` is `n - 1`. The previous values of `tem[i]` are not specifically stated, but since it was checked that `tem[i]` is not '9', we can infer that `tem[i]` had some other value (which could be any digit from '0' to '8'). The other variables (`L`, `A`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `tem[i]` is now '0'.

Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `tem[i]` is now '0'**.
