The value at index `i` of `tem` is converted to an integer, incremented by 1, and then converted back to a string to be reassigned to `tem[i]`. Since the initial value at `tem[i]` is not '9', the increment will not result in a carry over. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `tem[i]` is the incremented string value of its previous integer representation.
