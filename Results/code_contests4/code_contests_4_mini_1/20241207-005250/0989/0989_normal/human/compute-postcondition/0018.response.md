The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and `tem[i]` is now '1' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
