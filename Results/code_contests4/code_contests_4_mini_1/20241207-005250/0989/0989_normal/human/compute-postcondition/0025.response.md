The code sets `tem[i]` to '0'. The previous state indicates that if `tem[i]` was not equal to '9', it was set to '1' and a break occurred from the most internal loop or if statement. However, now `tem[i]` is explicitly set to '0', which will overwrite whatever value it had previously. 

Since `tem[i]` is now '0', the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `tem[i]` is '0'.

Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `tem[i]` is '0'**
