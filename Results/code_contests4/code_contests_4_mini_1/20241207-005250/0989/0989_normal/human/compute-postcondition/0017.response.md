`tem[i]` is assigned the value of `str(int(tem[i]) + 1)`. Since `tem[i]` is currently '0', we convert it to an integer, add 1, resulting in 1, and then convert it back to a string. Therefore, after execution, `tem[i]` becomes '1'. The values of the other variables (`L`, `A`, `n`, `i`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000, `A` is a positive integer represented as a string, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and `tem[i]` is now '1'**.
