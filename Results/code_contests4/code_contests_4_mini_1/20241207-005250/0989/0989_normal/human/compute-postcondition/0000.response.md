The variables `n` and `s` are assigned values based on user input. `n` is assigned the integer value of the input, and `s` is assigned the string value read from standard input after stripping any surrounding whitespace. The output state will reflect that `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000 and `A` is a positive integer represented as a string. However, since the values of `n` and `s` are determined by user input, we cannot specify their exact values.

Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string.**
