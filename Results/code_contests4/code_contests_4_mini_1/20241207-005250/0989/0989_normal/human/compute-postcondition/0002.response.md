`tem` is assigned the value `'1'` concatenated with `'0'` repeated `(n - 1)` times. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `tem` will depend on that input. Therefore, if `n` is, for example, 3, then `tem` would be `'100'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `tem` is '1' concatenated with '0' repeated (n - 1) times.**
