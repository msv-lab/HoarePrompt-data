Postcondition: ***`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 100000; `A` is a positive integer represented as a string; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string. If the length of `s` is not divisible by `n`, `tem` is '1' concatenated with '0' repeated (n - 1) times, and the output is `tem` concatenated (len(s) // n + 1) times. If the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, and the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, then `ans1` is a string of '9' repeated `len(s)` times, and `ans2` is '1' followed by `n` number of '0's; the output will be `ans1` if `ans1` is greater than `s`, otherwise, `ans2` will be printed repeated `len(s) // n` times. If the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9's, then `ans2` is formed by repeating the concatenated characters of `tem` a number of times determined by `len(s) // n`; the output will be `ans1` if `ans1` is greater than `s`, otherwise, `ans2` will be printed.***
