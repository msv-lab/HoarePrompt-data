#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9 and A â‰  B; V and W are integers such that 1 <= V, W <= 10^9; T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^9.
def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T
    lb = B + W * T
    if (A < B) :
        return la >= lb
        #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether la is greater than or equal to lb, based on the calculations where la = A + V * T and lb = B + W * T, given that A is less than B.
    else :
        return lb >= la
        #The program returns whether lb, which is B + W * T, is greater than or equal to la, which is A + V * T, given that A is greater than or equal to B.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers A and B, two positive integers V and W, and a positive integer T. It calculates la as A + V * T and lb as B + W * T, then returns True if la is greater than or equal to lb when A is less than B, and returns True if lb is greater than or equal to la when A is greater than or equal to B. The function effectively checks which of the two calculated values reaches or exceeds the other based on the relative initial values of A and B.
