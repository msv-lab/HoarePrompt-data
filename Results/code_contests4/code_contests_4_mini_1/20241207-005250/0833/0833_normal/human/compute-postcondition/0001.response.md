The code assigns the value of `lb` as `B + W * T`. The previous values of the variables `B`, `W`, and `T` are within the specified ranges. Since `A` and `B` are distinct integers and `V`, `W`, and `T` are positive integers, we can calculate `lb` based on `B`, `W`, and `T`.

Since the values of `B`, `W`, and `T` are not specified in the context, we cannot determine the exact value of `lb`, but we can express its relationship with the input variables. Therefore, the output state is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9 and A ≠ B; `V` and `W` are integers such that 1 <= V, W <= 10^9; `T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^9; `la` is calculated as A + V * T; `lb` is calculated as B + W * T.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9 and A ≠ B; `V` and `W` are integers such that 1 <= V, W <= 10^9; `T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^9; `la` is calculated as A + V * T; `lb` is calculated as B + W * T.**
