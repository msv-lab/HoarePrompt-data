To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine whether the child "it" can catch the other child within T seconds on a number line. The key points from the problem description are:
- Child "it" starts at position A and moves at speed V.
- The other child starts at position B and moves at speed W.
- We need to check if, after T seconds, both children will be at the same position.

### Program Logic
The program calculates the positions of both children after T seconds:
- `la = A + V * T` (position of the child "it")
- `lb = B + W * T` (position of the other child)

Then, it checks:
- If A < B, the program checks if `la >= lb`, which means the child "it" can catch the other child.
- If A > B, it checks if `lb >= la`, which means the other child can be caught.

### Correctness Evaluation
The conditions checked in the program can be misleading. Specifically:
1. The program assumes that if A < B, the only scenario to check is if "it" can reach or surpass the position of the other child, but it does not account for the fact that the other child may also be moving towards "it".
2. The reverse is true when A > B.
3. The program does not account for the relative speeds and distances properly. For example, if "it" is slower than the other child, he would never catch up, and the program would incorrectly return a result.

### Counter-example
Consider the following input:
```
A = 1, V = 1
B = 3, W = 2
T = 1
```
After 1 second:
- Child "it" would be at position `1 + 1 * 1 = 2`.
- The other child would be at position `3 + 2 * 1 = 5`.
- The program would evaluate `la >= lb` (2 >= 5), which is false, hence it would return "NO".
However, in reality, the child "it" would be moving towards the other child but would not catch her within the given time. The program fails to assess the scenario where speeds and positions must be compared more dynamically.

### Conclusion
Given these observations, the program does not fully adhere to the problem requirements as it fails to consider all cases correctly, especially the interaction of speeds and positions over time.

Correctness: **False**
