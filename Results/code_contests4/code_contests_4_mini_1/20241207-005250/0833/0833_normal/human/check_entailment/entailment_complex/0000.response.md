To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the code annotations.

### Problem Description Summary:
- We have two children on a number line: one at position A (child "it") and the other at position B.
- Child "it" moves at speed V, and the other child moves at speed W.
- We need to check if child "it" can catch the other child within T seconds.

### Key Requirements:
- The program should return "YES" if child "it" can catch the other child within T seconds, otherwise it should return "NO".
- Given constraints:
  - A and B are different integers within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
  - V and W are positive integers within the range [1, 10^9].
  - T is a positive integer within the range [1, 10^9].

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It calculates the positions of both children after T seconds:
   - `la` is the position of child "it" after T seconds: `la = A + V * T`
   - `lb` is the position of the other child after T seconds: `lb = B + W * T`
2. Depending on the comparison between A and B:
   - If A < B, it checks if `la` (the new position of child "it") is greater than or equal to `lb` (the new position of the other child).
   - If A > B, it checks if `lb` is greater than or equal to `la`.

### Correctness Check:
1. If `A < B`, for child "it" to catch the other child, it must cover the distance `(B - A)` within T seconds. The condition `la >= lb` translates to `A + V * T >= B + W * T`, which simplifies to `V * T >= (B - A) + W * T`. Rearranging gives us `V * T - W * T >= B - A`, or `(V - W) * T >= B - A`. This means if `V` is strictly greater than `W`, child "it" can catch the other child, otherwise he cannot.
  
2. If `A > B`, similar reasoning applies, but in reverse; we check if `lb >= la`, leading to the same implications.

### Conclusion:
- The program checks whether child "it" can catch the other child based on the relative speeds and initial positions.
- However, it does not explicitly handle the condition when speeds are equal (V == W), which is critical, as it should return "NO" in such a case since they will maintain their distances.

Given the analysis, the function does not cover the case where the speeds are equal, leading to potential misclassification of the result when V == W.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in every case, specifically when V == W.

Correctness: **False**
