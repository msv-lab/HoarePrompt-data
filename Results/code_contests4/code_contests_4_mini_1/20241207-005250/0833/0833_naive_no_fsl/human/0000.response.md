To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to assess whether it accurately determines if the child "it" can catch the other child within the given time `T`.

### Analyzing the Code
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(A, B, V, W, T)` calculates the final positions of both children after `T` seconds:
   - The position of child "it" after `T` seconds is `A + V * T`.
   - The position of the other child after `T` seconds is `B + W * T`.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The function checks:
   - If `A < B`, it returns `True` if the final position of "it" is greater than or equal to the final position of the other child (`la >= lb`).
   - If `A >= B`, it returns `True` if the final position of the other child is greater than or equal to that of "it" (`lb >= la`).

3. **Output**: Depending on the Boolean value returned by `func_1`, the program prints `YES` or `NO`.

### Potential Issues
The core logic of the program seems incorrect. The comparison logic is flawed because it doesn't take into account the actual distance each child would cover towards each other. The calculation should consider the distance between the two starting points `A` and `B`, and then check if child "it" can close that distance within `T` seconds, given their respective speeds `V` and `W`.

### Example Test Case
Let's consider a scenario where `A = 1`, `B = 5`, `V = 2`, `W = 2`, and `T = 2`:
- The distance between `A` and `B` is 4.
- Child "it" can cover `2 * 2 = 4` units in 2 seconds.
- The other child can move `2 * 2 = 4` units as well, but since they are moving away from each other, "it" cannot catch the other child.

According to the current program logic:
- It would calculate:
  - `la = 1 + 2 * 2 = 5`
  - `lb = 5 + 2 * 2 = 9`
- The check would yield `5 >= 9`, which is `False`, resulting in `NO`. However, the correct answer should be `NO`, so in this case, it works. 

### Conclusion
However, if we take another case, for instance, with `A = 1`, `B = 5`, `V = 3`, `W = 1`, and `T = 2`:
- Here, the distance between `A` and `B` is 4.
- Child "it" could cover 6 units in 2 seconds, while the other child moves only 2 units away.
- Thus, "it" should be able to catch the child.

The program, given its current structure and logic, would fail with cases where the two children are moving towards each other but the logic is incorrectly implemented.

### Final Verdict
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if "it" can catch the other child within `T` seconds due to the flawed comparison logic that does not account for the actual distance and relative speeds effectively.
