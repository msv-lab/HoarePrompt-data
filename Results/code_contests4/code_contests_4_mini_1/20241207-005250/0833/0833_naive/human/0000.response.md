To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: 
   - Two integers A (position of child "it") and B (position of the other child).
   - Two integers V (speed of child "it") and W (speed of the other child).
   - An integer T (time in seconds).

2. **Output**: 
   - Determine if child "it" can catch the other child within T seconds and print "YES" or "NO".

3. **Constraints**:
   - A and B are different.
   - All inputs are integers within specified bounds.

### Program Logic:
The function `func_1` computes the final positions of both children after T seconds:
- `la = A + V * T` (final position of child "it")
- `lb = B + W * T` (final position of the other child)

Then it checks:
- If A < B, it checks if `la >= lb` (if "it" can reach or surpass the position of the other child).
- If A > B, it checks if `lb >= la`.

### Critical Review:
We need to consider if the function correctly handles all scenarios, including edge cases:
1. **Same Direction**: If both children are moving towards each other or away from each other, the logic should cover that.
2. **Different Speeds**: The function must correctly calculate the final positions considering the speeds.

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Example Case**:
   - **Input**: A = 1, V = 2, B = 3, W = 1, T = 3
   - Child "it" moves to position `1 + 2 * 3 = 7`.
   - The other child moves to position `3 + 1 * 3 = 6`.
   - Output should be "YES" since `7 >= 6`.

2. **Counter Example Case**:
   - **Input**: A = 1, V = 2, B = 3, W = 2, T = 3
   - Child "it" moves to position `1 + 2 * 3 = 7`.
   - The other child moves to position `3 + 2 * 3 = 9`.
   - The output should be "NO" since `7 < 9`.

3. **Critical Edge Case**:
   - **Input**: A = 1, V = 1, B = 3, W = 2, T = 1
   - Child "it" moves to position `1 + 1 * 1 = 2`.
   - The other child moves to position `3 + 2 * 1 = 5`.
   - The output should be "NO" since `2 < 5`, but the function would return "YES" due to the condition not accounting for the case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly address situations where the child "it" is slower than the other child and they start at different distances such that the other child can escape. Therefore, the function does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
