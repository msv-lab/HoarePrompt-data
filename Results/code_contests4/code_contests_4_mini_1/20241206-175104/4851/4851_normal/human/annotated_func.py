#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of distinct positive integers, and its length n is an integer such that 1 < n ≤ 10^5. Each element of the list is an integer such that 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a):
    stack, ans = [], 0
    for i in a:
        while stack and stack[-1] < i:
            stack.pop()
        
        stack.append(i)
        
        if len(stack) > 1:
            ans = max(ans, stack[-1] ^ stack[-2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` contains elements from `a` that are in non-increasing order, `ans` is the maximum XOR of the last two elements in `stack`, or 0 if there are fewer than two elements.
    return ans
    #The program returns the maximum XOR of the last two elements in the 'stack', or 0 if there are fewer than two elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of distinct positive integers and computes the maximum XOR of the last two elements in a stack that maintains a non-increasing order of elements from the input list. If there are fewer than two elements processed in the stack, it returns 0.
