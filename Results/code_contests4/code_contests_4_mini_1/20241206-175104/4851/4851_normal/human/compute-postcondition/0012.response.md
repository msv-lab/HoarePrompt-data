Postcondition: ***`stack` contains original elements plus `i`, where `i` is the first element of `a`, and if the length of `stack` is greater than 1, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`.***
