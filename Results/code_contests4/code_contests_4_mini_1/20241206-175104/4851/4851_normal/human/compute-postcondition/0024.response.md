Postcondition: ***`stack` contains original elements minus all elements that were greater than or equal to `i`, and `i` is now added to `stack`. If the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`.***
