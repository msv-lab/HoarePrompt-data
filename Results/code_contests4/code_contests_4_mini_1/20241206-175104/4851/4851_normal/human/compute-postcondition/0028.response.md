According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both conditions `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i` are satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` has one less element after popping the last element, which means it currently has at least one element left for the loop to potentially execute again. 

However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, and since `i` remains as `next_i`, we know it hasn't changed. The requirement for the loop to execute one more time is that the new last element of `stack` (after the last pop operation) must still be less than `i`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the last element of `stack` is indeed less than `next_i`.

Assuming that the last element of `stack` was less than `i` before popping, it implies that the current last element of `stack` must also be less than `next_i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`stack` has one less element after popping the last element and for the loop to execute again, the new last element of `stack` must be less than `next_i`.**
