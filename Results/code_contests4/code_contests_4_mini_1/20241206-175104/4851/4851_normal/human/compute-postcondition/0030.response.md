According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions involving the `stack` and the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` (i.e., `stack[-1]`) is less than `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `stack` has one less element after popping the last element. This means `stack` is not empty, but we do not know the value of the new last element of `stack` after the pop operation. 

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to verify that the new last element of `stack` is still less than `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that the last element of `stack` must be less than `i`.

State: **`stack` has one less element after popping the last element and for the loop to execute again, the last element of stack must be less than `i`**
