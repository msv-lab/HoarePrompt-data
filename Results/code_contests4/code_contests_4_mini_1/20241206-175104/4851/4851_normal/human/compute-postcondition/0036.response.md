Postcondition: ***`stack` contains `i`, `i` remains as `next_i`, and the loop continues executing until all elements in `stack` are greater than or equal to `i`. If the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the result of `stack[-1] ^ stack[-2]`.***
