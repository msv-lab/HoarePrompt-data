The value of `i` is appended to `stack`. Since `i` is not in `stack`, the new state of `stack` will now include `i` as an additional element. The previous elements in `stack` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains original elements minus all elements that were greater than or equal to `i`, and `i` is now added to `stack`.

Output State: **`stack` contains original elements minus all elements that were greater than or equal to `i`, and `i` is now added to `stack`.**
