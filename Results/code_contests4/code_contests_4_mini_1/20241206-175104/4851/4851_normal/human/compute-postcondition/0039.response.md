The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`. `a` is a list of distinct positive integers, and its length `n` is an integer such that 1 < n ≤ 10^5. Each element of the list is an integer such that 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, if there are fewer than two elements in 'stack', the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns the maximum XOR of the last two elements in the 'stack'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of distinct positive integers and return the maximum XOR of the last two elements in 'stack' or 0 if there are fewer than two elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of distinct positive integers and returns the maximum XOR of the last two elements in 'stack', or 0 if there are fewer than two elements.**
