According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both conditions `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i` are met. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` has its last element removed, which means it is now missing the last element that was previously there. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `stack` must not be empty and its new last element must be less than `i`.

Since `i` is the first element of `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers, we need to ensure that there is at least one element remaining in `stack` that is less than `i`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `stack` to ensure it has at least one element that is less than `i`. 

State: **`a` is a list of distinct positive integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, and for the loop to execute again `stack` must contain at least one element less than `i`**.
