Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by the given set of special points. The main issue lies in the way the area is calculated and the selection of points to form the quadrilateral.

1. **Incorrect Area Calculation**: The area function `func_1` is designed to calculate the area based on three points, but the logic for finding a quadrilateral requires selecting four points. The current implementation does not account for checking all combinations of four points to find the maximal area, which is essential for solving the problem correctly.

2. **Missing Combinations**: The nested loops in the program only consider pairs of points and then a third point to calculate areas, but they do not iterate through all combinations of four points. This leads to situations where valid quadrilaterals may be missed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
0 0
0 4
4 0
4 4
```
The expected output is `16.000000`, which corresponds to the area of a square formed by the first four points. However, the current logic in the program may not be able to compute this because it does not evaluate all four points simultaneously.

In conclusion, since the program does not correctly find the maximal area of a special quadrilateral by evaluating all sets of four points, the correctness of the program is therefore **False**.
