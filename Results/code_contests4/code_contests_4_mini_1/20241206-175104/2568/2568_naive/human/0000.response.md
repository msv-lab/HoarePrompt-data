To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by points in the Cartesian plane. A quadrilateral has four vertices, and the area calculation must be accurate to within an absolute or relative error of \(10^{-9}\).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the area of a triangle formed by three points using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|
   \]
   This is correct for calculating the area of a triangle.

2. **Input Reading**: 
   The program reads `n` points and stores them in a list called `Points`. This part of the code seems to work correctly as it gathers the input points.

3. **Area Calculation Logic**:
   - The nested loops iterate over pairs of points `(i, j)` to form the base of the quadrilateral.
   - For each pair of points, another loop iterates over all other points (`z`) to compute areas by treating the points `(i, j)` as a base and point `z` as a third vertex.
   - The program calculates the area using the `func_1` function and keeps track of the maximum positive area (`maxx1`) and maximum negative area (`maxx2`).

4. **Final Area Computation**: 
   The code checks if `maxx1 + maxx2` is greater than the current maximum area found (`maxx`). This logic is flawed because it does not consider the fourth vertex necessary for a quadrilateral. The algorithm seems to only find triangles instead of quadrilaterals.

### Potential Case:
- Consider a set of points that could form a valid quadrilateral. For example:
  ```
  Input:
  4
  0 0
  0 4
  4 0
  4 4
  ```
  The maximal area should be the area of a square formed by these points, which is `16`. However, the program only calculates triangle areas and does not combine areas to consider the full quadrilateral.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the requirements to form a quadrilateral (it only calculates triangle areas and does not account for the fourth vertex), it cannot guarantee the correct maximal area as required.

Correctness: **False**.
