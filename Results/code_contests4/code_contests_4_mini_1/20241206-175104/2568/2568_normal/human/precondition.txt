x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, and y3 are integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of a quadrilateral where x1, x2, and x3 are x-coordinates of three points, and y1, y2, and y3 are y-coordinates of three points, and there are at least four special points with coordinates in the range of -1000 to 1000.
