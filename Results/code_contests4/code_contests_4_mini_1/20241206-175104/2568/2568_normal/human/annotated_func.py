#State of the program right berfore the function call: x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, and y3 are integers representing the x and y coordinates of three distinct special points in the Cartesian plane, and n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 300, representing the number of special points with coordinates in the range -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3):
    area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)
    return area / 2
    #The program returns half of the calculated area using the formula: area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts six integer parameters (x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3) representing the coordinates of three distinct points in the Cartesian plane and returns half of the calculated area of the triangle formed by these points using the formula: area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2). This calculation is valid for any integer coordinates provided within the specified range, and there are no checks for collinearity of the points or for edge cases like zero area.
