The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`. All of these parameters are integers representing the x and y coordinates of three distinct special points in the Cartesian plane. After executing the function body, it calculates the area using the formula: area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2) and returns half of this calculated area. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the coordinates of three distinct points and return half of the area determined by these points in the Cartesian plane.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, and y3 representing coordinates of three distinct points, and returns half of the calculated area based on these coordinates.**
