Functionality: ** The function accepts six integer parameters (x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3) representing the coordinates of three distinct points in the Cartesian plane and returns half of the calculated area of the triangle formed by these points using the formula: area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2). This calculation is valid for any integer coordinates provided within the specified range, and there are no checks for collinearity of the points or for edge cases like zero area.**
