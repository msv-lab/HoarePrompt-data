The variable `area` is calculated using the formula based on the coordinates of the three special points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3). The formula computes the signed area of the triangle formed by these three points in the Cartesian plane. The output state will reflect the value of `area` based on the initial values of the coordinates.

Output State: **`area` is calculated using the formula: `area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)`**
