You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Iahub has drawn a set of n points in the cartesian plane which he calls "special points". A quadrilateral is a simple polygon without self-intersections with four sides (also called edges) and four vertices (also called corners). Please note that a quadrilateral doesn't have to be convex. A special quadrilateral is one which has all four vertices in the set of special points. Given the set of special points, please calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. 

Input

The first line contains integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 300). Each of the next n lines contains two integers: xi, yi ( - 1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000) — the cartesian coordinates of ith special point. It is guaranteed that no three points are on the same line. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide. 

Output

Output a single real number — the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does't exceed 10 - 9.

Examples

Input

5
0 0
0 4
4 0
4 4
2 3


Output

16.000000

Note

In the test example we can choose first 4 points to be the vertices of the quadrilateral. They form a square by side 4, so the area is 4·4 = 16.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, and y3 are integers representing the x and y coordinates of three distinct special points in the Cartesian plane, and n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 300, representing the number of special points with coordinates in the range -1000 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3):
    area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)
    return area / 2
    #The program returns half of the calculated area using the formula: area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts six integer parameters (x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3) representing the coordinates of three distinct points in the Cartesian plane and returns half of the calculated area of the triangle formed by these points using the formula: area = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2). This calculation is valid for any integer coordinates provided within the specified range, and there are no checks for collinearity of the points or for edge cases like zero area.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
