Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not comply with the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` calculates the area of a triangle formed by three points, not a quadrilateral. The problem requires calculating the maximal area of a quadrilateral formed by four points.

2. **Input Handling**: The function only takes three points (x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, and y3) as input, while the problem specifies that the maximal area of a quadrilateral must be determined, which requires four points.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area formula used in the function is specifically for triangles (using the determinant method), which is not applicable for quadrilaterals. The area of a quadrilateral requires a different approach, often involving either decomposing it into triangles or using a specific formula based on the coordinates of the four vertices.

4. **Maximal Area Calculation**: The problem requires iterating through combinations of the provided points to find the quadrilateral with the maximal area, which is not addressed in the function.

In summary, since the function is designed to compute the area of a triangle and does not take four points or calculate the maximal area of a quadrilateral, it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
