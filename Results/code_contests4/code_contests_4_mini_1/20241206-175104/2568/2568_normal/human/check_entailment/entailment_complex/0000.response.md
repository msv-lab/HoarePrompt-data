Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the area of a triangle formed by three points in the Cartesian plane, not a quadrilateral formed by four points as required by the problem description. 

The problem specifically asks for the maximal area of a special quadrilateral, which involves selecting four points from a given set of points and calculating the area of the quadrilateral they form. The annotated program does not handle the following:

1. It only accepts three points' coordinates and calculates the area of a triangle, which does not satisfy the requirement of calculating a quadrilateral's area.
2. There is no mechanism to evaluate all possible combinations of four points from the set of special points.
3. It lacks functionality to compute the maximal area from potentially many quadrilaterals formed by different sets of four points.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
