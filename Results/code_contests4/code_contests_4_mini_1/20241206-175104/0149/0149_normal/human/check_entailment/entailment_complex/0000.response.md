To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all chess pieces on either all black or all white cells of a 1 Ã— n chessboard.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads an even integer `n` and a list of distinct integers (positions of chess pieces) from standard input.
    - It decrements each position by 1 to convert from 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing, which is appropriate for Python lists.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
    - The program initializes two sums, `even` and `odd`.
    - It computes `even` as the sum of distances of pieces from their ideal positions if they were placed on even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
    - It computes `odd` as the sum of distances of pieces from their ideal positions if they were placed on odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
    - The ideal positions for placement are based on the assumption that all pieces can be relocated to either all even or all odd indices without overlap.

3. **Output**:
    - Finally, the program prints the minimum of the two sums, which represents the least number of moves required to achieve the desired arrangement.

### Problem Description Requirements:
- The program must ensure that all pieces occupy cells of the same color (all black or all white).
- The moves should be minimized, and pieces cannot overlap.

### Conclusion:
- The chessboard alternates colors: positions 0, 2, 4, ... are black and positions 1, 3, 5, ... are white.
- The program computes the correct distances to both sets of positions (even and odd), ensuring that it considers both possible configurations.
- Since all calculations are based on absolute differences from the ideal positions, it guarantees that the minimum number of moves is calculated correctly.

The critical point is that the program correctly identifies the positions that are either "black" (even indices) or "white" (odd indices) and calculates the moves accordingly.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description requirements and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
