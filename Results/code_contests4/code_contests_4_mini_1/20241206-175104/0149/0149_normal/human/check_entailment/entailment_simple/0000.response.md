Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an even integer `n` which represents the size of the chessboard and a list of distinct integers that represent the initial positions of the chess pieces. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Position Adjustment**: The program decrements each position by 1 (to convert from 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing), which is necessary for calculations in Python as lists are zero-indexed.

3. **Even and Odd Calculation**: The program calculates two sums:
   - `even`: The total number of moves required to align all pieces to the black cells (even indexed positions).
   - `odd`: The total number of moves required to align all pieces to the white cells (odd indexed positions).
   This is done using absolute differences, which correctly reflects the number of moves needed to shift pieces from their current positions to the target positions.

4. **Minimum Moves Calculation**: Finally, the program prints the minimum of the two calculated sums (`even` and `odd`), which represents the minimum moves needed to gather all pieces in one color.

5. **Efficiency and Correctness**: The program runs in linear time relative to `n`, which is efficient given the constraints (n up to 100). It directly follows the logic needed to solve the problem as specified.

Thus, the program accurately implements the solution to the problem description, ensuring all pieces can be moved to cells of the same color with the minimum number of moves.
