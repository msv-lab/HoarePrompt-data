The variable `p` is assigned the value obtained from `list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))`, which processes a line of input, splits it into individual string elements by spaces, converts each of these elements to an integer, and then creates a list of these integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this operation. The output state will reflect that `p` now holds a list of integers based on the input provided, while `n` retains its previous value as an even integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers from input.**
