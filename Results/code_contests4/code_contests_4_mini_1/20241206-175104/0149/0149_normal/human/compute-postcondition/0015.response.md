The function `func` accepts two parameters: an even integer `n` and a list of integers representing the initial positions of chess pieces. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and it is specified that the list of positions contains distinct integers where each position `pi` satisfies 1 ≤ pi ≤ n. 

The function does not return a specific value outlined in the provided output; hence, we will focus only on the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of distinct integers representing chess piece positions (1 ≤ pi ≤ n).**
