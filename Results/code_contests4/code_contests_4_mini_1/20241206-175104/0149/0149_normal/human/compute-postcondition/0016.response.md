Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of distinct integers representing chess piece positions (1 ≤ pi ≤ n). It computes two sums: `even`, which represents the total distance of the pieces from their ideal positions if placed at even indices, and `odd`, which represents the total distance if placed at odd indices. The function then prints the minimum of these two sums, indicating the least total movement required to arrange the pieces either at even or odd indices. **
