Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of integers modified to be each element decremented by 1; `even` is the sum of `abs(i * 2 - p[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n/2 - 1; `odd` is the sum of `abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n/2 - 1; the minimum of `even` and `odd` is printed.**
