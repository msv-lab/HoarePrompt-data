To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The problem describes a chessboard where pieces can be moved to either all black or all white cells, and we need to calculate the minimum number of moves.

### Code Analysis
Here's the given program:

```python
n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
p = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
p = [pi - 1 for pi in p]
even = odd = 0
for i in range(n / 2):
    even += abs(i * 2 - p[i])
    odd += abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])
print(min(even, odd))
```

### Issues with the Code
1. **Indexing Issue**: The program calculates moves based on the assumption that the first `n/2` pieces can be placed at indices `0, 2, 4, ...` for black cells and `1, 3, 5, ...` for white cells. However, the list `p` is not defined to correspond directly to these positions. The pieces' positions in `p` are not sorted or aligned with the even/odd calculation.
  
2. **Looping through the wrong range**: The loop iterates with `range(n / 2)`, which would result in a float due to the division. This should be `range(n // 2)` to ensure integer division.

3. **Calculation of moves**: The way the moves are calculated does not consider the order of the pieces. If the pieces are not sorted, then the calculated moves may not represent the minimal moves required to group them all into either color.

### Example of Failure Case
Consider the following input:
```
6
1 3 5
```
- For black cells (0, 2, 4), the optimal moves would be:
  - Move piece at position 1 to position 0 (1 move)
  - Move piece at position 3 to position 2 (1 move)
  - Move piece at position 5 to position 4 (1 move)
  
  Total moves = 3.

- For white cells (1, 3, 5):
  - Already in positions (0 moves).

Thus, the minimum should be 0 moves for white, but the program would not correctly calculate this because it doesn't sort or align the pieces before calculating the moves.

### Conclusion
Due to the above issues in indexing and incorrect calculation of minimum moves based on the current positions, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
