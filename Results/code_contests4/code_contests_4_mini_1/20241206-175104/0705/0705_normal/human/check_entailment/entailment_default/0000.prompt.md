You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(result):
    if result[0]:
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            (print(i),)
    else:
        print('NO')
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts a tuple `result` where the first element is a boolean indicating if the total available weight meets or exceeds a specified amount, and the second element is a string of exactly ten characters ('0's and '1's) representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos. It prints 'YES' followed by the characters of the second element if the first element is true; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, contrary to the annotation suggesting it returns a boolean based on weight availability.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if len(l) == m:
        return (True, l)
    else:
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            if tmp[0]:
                return (True, tmp[1])
        return (False,)
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts a string `l` consisting of '0's and '1's, a positive integer `w`, and a positive integer `m`. It checks if the length of `l` equals `m`. If they are equal, it returns `True` and the string `l`. If they are not equal, it attempts to generate new strings by appending elements from the result of `func_3(l, w)` to `l` and recursively calling itself. If a valid new string is found, it returns `True` and that new string. If no valid strings are found, or if a type error occurs due to an invalid operation (like concatenating a string with a list), the function returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `l` might not be a list initially, which could lead to runtime errors.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq:
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
    else:
        return weights
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts a string `seq` of length 10, consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and an integer `weights` representing the total number of weights. If `seq` is not empty, it computes the absolute difference between the sums of weights represented by even and odd indices in `seq`. It then returns a list of weights that are greater than this computed difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` contains only '0's, the function returns an empty list. Note that the function does not handle cases where `weights` is not a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
    return result
sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)
func_1(func_2([], func_4(raw_input()), int(raw_input())))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts a string `w` of length 10, consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It returns a list containing the indices (1-based) of all '1's found in the string. If there are no '1's in the string, the function will return an empty list.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
