To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and annotations carefully.

### Problem Description:
Xenia has weights (1 to 10 kg) and wants to place `m` weights on two pans of a scale following these rules:
1. No two consecutive weights can be the same.
2. The weight on one pan must always outweigh the other.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1**: This function checks if the first element of `result` is true, indicating that weights are available, and prints 'YES' followed by the weights. If not, it prints 'NO'. However, it does not actually generate or validate the weights according to the rules defined.

2. **Function 2**: This function attempts to recursively build a list of weights, checking if the length of the list equals `m` and returning it if so. It calls `func_3` to generate new weights, but it doesn't handle the case where the input is not formatted correctly. Specifically, it assumes `l` is a list but starts with a string.

3. **Function 3**: It calculates the absolute difference between weights on the two pans and returns weights that are greater than this difference. However, it does not ensure that the weights can be chosen according to the rules (i.e., alternating weights and strictly greater for one pan).

4. **Function 4**: This function extracts available weights from the string representation. It correctly identifies the available weights but does not ensure they can be used as per the rules laid out in the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not ensure strict alternation of weights and does not enforce the "strictly greater" condition consistently across all calls. The recursive nature of `func_2` may lead to situations where the weights chosen do not satisfy the constraints, especially if the available weights do not allow for the required alternation and strict dominance.
- For instance, if `m` is 2 and the only available weight is '1' kg (i.e., `0000000001`), the program would incorrectly conclude it's possible to fulfill the requirement, while in reality, it cannot place two consecutive '1's without breaking the rules.

### Conclusion:
Since there are cases where the program can produce incorrect outputs based on the rules provided in the problem description (as illustrated with the above example), we conclude that the code fails to meet the requirements fully.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**
