You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result[0]` is true; `result[1]` contains exactly 10 elements, each being '0' or '1'; `i` is each element of `result[1]` printed in sequence.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). If `result[0]` is true, then `result[1]` contains exactly 10 elements, each being '0' or '1', and each element of `result[1]` is printed in sequence. If `result[0]` is false, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `result` where the first element is a boolean indicating if the total available weight meets or exceeds a specified amount, and the second element is a string of exactly ten characters ('0's and '1's) representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos. It prints 'YES' followed by the characters of the second element if the first element is true; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, contrary to the annotation suggesting it returns a boolean based on weight availability.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's, w is a positive integer representing the number of weights to be placed (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000), and the total number of weights (m) must be a positive integer.
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns True and the string 'l' of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's; `w` is a positive integer; `i` is in the range determined by func_3(l, w); `tmp` is the final value returned from the last call to func_2(l + [i], w, m); if no valid return occurred, the loop did not execute, `i` remains 0, and `tmp` is undefined.
        return False,
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `l` consisting of '0's and '1's, a positive integer `w`, and a positive integer `m`. It checks if the length of `l` equals `m`. If they are equal, it returns `True` and the string `l`. If they are not equal, it attempts to generate new strings by appending elements from the result of `func_3(l, w)` to `l` and recursively calling itself. If a valid new string is found, it returns `True` and that new string. If no valid strings are found, or if a type error occurs due to an invalid operation (like concatenating a string with a list), the function returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `l` might not be a list initially, which could lead to runtime errors.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and weights is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns the list of weights that are greater than the absolute difference 'tmp' and not equal to the last character of the string 'seq' of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's.
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns an empty list of weights since `seq` contains only '0's, indicating no available weights from 1 to 10 kilos.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `seq` of length 10, consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and an integer `weights` representing the total number of weights. If `seq` is not empty, it computes the absolute difference between the sums of weights represented by even and odd indices in `seq`. It then returns a list of weights that are greater than this computed difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` contains only '0's, the function returns an empty list. Note that the function does not handle cases where `weights` is not a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string of length 10 consisting of characters '0' and '1', where each character indicates the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos respectively, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string of length 10, `result` is a list containing the indices of all '1's in `w`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' containing the indices of all '1's in the string 'w' of length 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `w` of length 10, consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It returns a list containing the indices (1-based) of all '1's found in the string. If there are no '1's in the string, the function will return an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
