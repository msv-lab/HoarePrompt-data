Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Weight Placement Logic**: The program does not ensure that weights are placed on the scales alternately between the left and right pans as specified. The requirement states that the first weight goes on the left pan, the second on the right, the third on the left, and so on. The logic in the program does not enforce this alternating placement.

2. **Consecutive Weights Check**: The program does not correctly implement the rule that disallows placing two consecutive weights of the same value. The way the program is structured, there is no explicit check to ensure that a weight being placed is different from the previously placed weight.

3. **Sum Comparison**: The requirement states that each time a weight is added, the sum of the weights on the pan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan. The program lacks the mechanism to keep track of the cumulative weights on both pans and does not check if the pan receiving the new weight is indeed outweighed by the other pan.

4. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: The functions are not properly defined to handle weight placements as per the rules. For example, `func_2` is intended to recursively find a valid combination of weights, but it incorrectly relies on the length of `l` to determine success, which does not align with the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program does not satisfy the constraints and requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
