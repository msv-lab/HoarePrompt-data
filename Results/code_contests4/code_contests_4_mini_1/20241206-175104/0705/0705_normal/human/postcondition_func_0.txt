The function accepts a tuple `result` where the first element is a boolean indicating if the total available weight meets or exceeds a specified amount, and the second element is a string of exactly ten characters ('0's and '1's) representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos. It prints 'YES' followed by the characters of the second element if the first element is true; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, contrary to the annotation suggesting it returns a boolean based on weight availability.
