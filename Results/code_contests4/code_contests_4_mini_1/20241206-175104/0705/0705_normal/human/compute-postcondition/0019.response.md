The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `l` and `w`, with the following constraints: `l` is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's, and `w` is a positive integer representing the number of weights to be placed, where \(1 \leq w \leq 1000\). Additionally, there is a third parameter, `m`, which must also be a positive integer representing the total number of weights.

Based on the output conditions:

- **Case 1**: The function returns `True` along with the string `l`.
- **Case 2**: The function returns `True` and the second element of a tuple `tmp` derived from the function, where the first element is `True`.
- **Case 3**: The function returns `True` and the second element of `tmp`, which is a result of `func_2` with updated parameters.
- **Case 4**: The function attempts to return a tuple containing `True` and the second element of `tmp`, but a `TypeError` occurs due to an invalid operation involving concatenating a string with a list.
- **Case 5**: The function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `l`, a positive integer `w`, and a positive integer `m`, and based on certain conditions, it may return a boolean value (`True` or `False`) along with specific elements derived from the input parameters or internal computations, while handling potential errors such as type mismatches. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `l` of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's, a positive integer `w`, and a positive integer `m`. It returns `True` with the string `l`, or with elements from a derived tuple `tmp`, or it may return `False`, with potential errors in specific cases.**
