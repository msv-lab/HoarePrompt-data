Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `l` consisting of '0's and '1's, a positive integer `w`, and a positive integer `m`. It checks if the length of `l` equals `m`. If they are equal, it returns `True` and the string `l`. If they are not equal, it attempts to generate new strings by appending elements from the result of `func_3(l, w)` to `l` and recursively calling itself. If a valid new string is found, it returns `True` and that new string. If no valid strings are found, or if a type error occurs due to an invalid operation (like concatenating a string with a list), the function returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `l` might not be a list initially, which could lead to runtime errors.**
