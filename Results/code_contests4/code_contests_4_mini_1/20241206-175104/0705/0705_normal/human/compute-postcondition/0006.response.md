The code `result.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `result`. Since `i` is 2, the value 2 is added to `result`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the addition of `i` to `result`.

Output State: **`w` is a string of length 10, `result` has the value 2 appended, `i` is 2**
