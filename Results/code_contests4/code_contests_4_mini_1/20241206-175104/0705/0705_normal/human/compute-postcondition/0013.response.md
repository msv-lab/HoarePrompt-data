The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `w`. `w` is a string of length 10 consisting of characters '0' and '1', where each character indicates the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns a list `result` containing the indices of all '1's in the string `w`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a string `w` and return a list of indices where '1's are present in that string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `w` of length 10 and returns a list of indices of all '1's in the string.**
