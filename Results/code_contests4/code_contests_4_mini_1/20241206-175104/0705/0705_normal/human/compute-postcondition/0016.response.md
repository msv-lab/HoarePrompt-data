Postcondition: ***`l` is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's, `w` is a positive integer, and `i` is 2. If `tmp[0]` is truthy, the program attempts to return a tuple containing True and the second element of `tmp`, resulting in a TypeError due to an invalid operation of concatenating a string with a list. There is no else part in the code.***
