#State of the program right berfore the function call: The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result[0]` is true; `result[1]` contains exactly 10 elements, each being '0' or '1'; `i` is each element of `result[1]` printed in sequence.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The first input is a string of exactly ten characters consisting of '0's and '1's representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and the second input is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). If `result[0]` is true, then `result[1]` contains exactly 10 elements, each being '0' or '1', and each element of `result[1]` is printed in sequence. If `result[0]` is false, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `result` where the first element is a boolean indicating if the total available weight meets or exceeds a specified amount, and the second element is a string of exactly ten characters ('0's and '1's) representing the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos. It prints 'YES' followed by the characters of the second element if the first element is true; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, contrary to the annotation suggesting it returns a boolean based on weight availability.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's, w is a positive integer representing the number of weights to be placed (1 ≤ w ≤ 1000), and the total number of weights (m) must be a positive integer.
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns True and the string 'l' of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's; `w` is a positive integer; `i` is in the range determined by func_3(l, w); `tmp` is the final value returned from the last call to func_2(l + [i], w, m); if no valid return occurred, the loop did not execute, `i` remains 0, and `tmp` is undefined.
        return False,
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `l` consisting of '0's and '1's, a positive integer `w`, and a positive integer `m`. It checks if the length of `l` equals `m`. If they are equal, it returns `True` and the string `l`. If they are not equal, it attempts to generate new strings by appending elements from the result of `func_3(l, w)` to `l` and recursively calling itself. If a valid new string is found, it returns `True` and that new string. If no valid strings are found, or if a type error occurs due to an invalid operation (like concatenating a string with a list), the function returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `l` might not be a list initially, which could lead to runtime errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and weights is an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns the list of weights that are greater than the absolute difference 'tmp' and not equal to the last character of the string 'seq' of length 10 consisting of '0's and '1's.
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns an empty list of weights since `seq` contains only '0's, indicating no available weights from 1 to 10 kilos.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `seq` of length 10, consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and an integer `weights` representing the total number of weights. If `seq` is not empty, it computes the absolute difference between the sums of weights represented by even and odd indices in `seq`. It then returns a list of weights that are greater than this computed difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` contains only '0's, the function returns an empty list. Note that the function does not handle cases where `weights` is not a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string of length 10 consisting of characters '0' and '1', where each character indicates the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos respectively, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string of length 10, `result` is a list containing the indices of all '1's in `w`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' containing the indices of all '1's in the string 'w' of length 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `w` of length 10, consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It returns a list containing the indices (1-based) of all '1's found in the string. If there are no '1's in the string, the function will return an empty list.
