The function accepts a string `seq` of length 10, consisting of '0's and '1's indicating the availability of weights from 1 to 10 kilos, and an integer `weights` representing the total number of weights. If `seq` is not empty, it computes the absolute difference between the sums of weights represented by even and odd indices in `seq`. It then returns a list of weights that are greater than this computed difference and not equal to the last character of `seq`. If `seq` contains only '0's, the function returns an empty list. Note that the function does not handle cases where `weights` is not a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
