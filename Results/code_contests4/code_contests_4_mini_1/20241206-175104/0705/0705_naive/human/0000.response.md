To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Weights must alternate between left and right pans.
2. No two consecutive weights can be of the same type.
3. The sum of weights on one pan must always be strictly greater than the other.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function `func_4` converts the binary string into a list of available weights.
2. `func_3` calculates the difference between the weights on the two pans and returns a list of possible weights that can be added to maintain the strict inequality condition. It specifically ensures that the next weight added is not the same as the last one added.
3. `func_2` recursively builds the list of weights until `m` weights are added or all options are exhausted.
4. The base case in `func_2` checks if the length of the current weight list equals `m`.

### Potential Issues:
1. The recursion in `func_2` might not explore all combinations correctly due to the way `func_3` filters the weights, especially in cases where the difference in sums is not appropriately managed.
2. If there is only one type of weight available, the program might not handle it correctly. For example, if the input is "1000000000" and `m` is 2, the program should return "NO" since it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.
3. The program does not handle the case where all weights are the same and thus cannot alternate correctly. 

### Edge Case:
- Input: 
  ```
  0000000000
  1
  ```
  This case should output "NO" because no weights are available.

- Input:
  ```
  1000000000
  2
  ```
  This case should output "NO" since we can only use the 1 kg weight, which would lead to a consecutive same weight scenario.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential cases where the program could fail to meet the requirements, particularly the one where no weights are provided or where only one type of weight is available, the program does not satisfy the problem description completely.

Correctness: **False**.
