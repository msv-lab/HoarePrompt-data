Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description requirements for several reasons:

1. **Missing Input Handling**: The problem description specifies that for a given integer `n`, we need to find a positive integer `a` such that `a + ar = n`, where `ar` is the reverse of `a`. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not even take `n` as input, nor do they attempt to find any valid `a`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding `a`**: The program only defines a function to reverse an integer and a function to add the integer to its reverse. It does not implement any logic to search for a valid `a` that satisfies the equation `a + ar = n`. Simply adding `a` and its reverse does not guarantee that the result will equal `n`, nor does it attempt to check if a valid `a` exists.

3. **Lack of Output Logic**: The program lacks logic to output the required results based on the input `n`. The problem requires that if no valid `a` exists, the output should be `0`, but this is not addressed in the program.

4. **No Validation for Leading Zeros**: The logic to ensure that `a` does not start with a leading zero is not present. This is crucial as the problem specifies that `a` must be a positive integer without leading zeroes.

In summary, the provided program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description, as it neither attempts to find a suitable integer `a` nor provides the necessary output format. Thus, it fails to meet the criteria for correctness.
