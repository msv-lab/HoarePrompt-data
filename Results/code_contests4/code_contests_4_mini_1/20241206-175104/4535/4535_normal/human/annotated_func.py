#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(x):
    return int(str(x)[::-1])
    #The program returns the integer value of x with its digits reversed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer x and returns the integer value of x with its digits reversed. It handles very large integers due to Python's support for arbitrary-precision integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000.
def func_2(x):
    return x + func_1(x)
    #The program returns the sum of the positive integer x and the result of func_1(x), where x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^100000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` (with a range from 1 to \(10^{100000}\)) and returns the sum of `x` and the result of calling `func_1(x)`. The specific behavior of `func_1(x)` is not defined in the provided code, so the overall behavior of the function depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
