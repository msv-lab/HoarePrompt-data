The function accepts a positive integer `x` (with a range from 1 to \(10^{100000}\)) and returns the sum of `x` and the result of calling `func_1(x)`. The specific behavior of `func_1(x)` is not defined in the provided code, so the overall behavior of the function depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
