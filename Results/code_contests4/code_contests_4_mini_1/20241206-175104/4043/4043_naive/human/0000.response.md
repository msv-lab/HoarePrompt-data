To determine whether the given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, we will analyze the program step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two given positive integers A and B.
   - A common divisor is a number that divides both A and B.
   - Two numbers are coprime if their only common divisor is 1.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program begins by defining a function `func_1` that checks if a number is prime.
   - It then reads two integers A and B from the input.
   - It generates the list of divisors for A and B using a loop that checks for divisibility up to the square root of each number.
   - It counts how many of these common divisors are prime using the previously defined function.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only counts prime common divisors. It does not account for the possibility of having multiple non-prime coprime common divisors.
   - For example, in the case of A = 6 and B = 10:
     - The common divisors are 1 and 2.
     - Here, both 1 and 2 are coprime, and thus both can be chosen.
     - However, the program will only count 2 as it only considers prime common divisors.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - For A = 6 and B = 10:
     - The program counts only the prime common divisor (which is 2), resulting in a count of 1.
     - However, both 1 and 2 are valid coprime common divisors.
   - Thus, the expected maximum count should be 2, but the program returns 1.

Given this analysis, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements as it fails to account for non-prime coprime common divisors.

Correctness: **False**.
