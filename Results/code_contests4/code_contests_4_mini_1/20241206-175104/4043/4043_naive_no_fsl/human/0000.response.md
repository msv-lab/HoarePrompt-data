To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Given two positive integers A and B.
2. We need to find the maximum number of positive common divisors of A and B that are coprime to each other.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Prime Check Function**: The `func_1(n)` function checks if a number `n` is prime by checking divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n`. This is used to ensure that the common divisors are coprime.
   
2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The code computes the divisors of both A and B using two loops that iterate up to the square root of each number. It appends the divisors to lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Counting Coprime Common Divisors**:
   - The code then iterates over the divisors of A (`a`) and checks if they are also in the divisors of B (`b`).
   - For each common divisor found, it checks if it is prime using `func_1(i)`, incrementing a counter `c` if it is.

### Issues Identified:
The main issue with the current implementation is the assumption that the only common divisors that can be chosen are prime. However, the problem does not state that we can only choose prime divisors. The correct approach should count all common divisors, not just the prime ones.

**Counterexample**:
- Consider the input `A = 12` and `B = 18`.
  - The common divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
  - The coprime pairs that can be selected are (1), (2), (3), and (6), meaning we can select 3 coprime common divisors: 1, 2, and 3.

In the provided code, only the prime common divisors would be counted, which would yield an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of coprime common divisors. Since it only counts prime common divisors and does not consider other combinations that could be coprime, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
