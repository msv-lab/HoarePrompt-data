def func_1(n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return True

    for k in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` and `B` are positive integers, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `n` is prime.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the positive integer n is prime.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns True if `n` is prime (i.e., greater than 1 and not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself). If `n` is 1 or not prime, it returns False.
