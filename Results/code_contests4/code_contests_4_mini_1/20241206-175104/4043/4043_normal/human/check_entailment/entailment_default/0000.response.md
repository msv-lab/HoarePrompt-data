To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the code implementation.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task requires finding the maximum number of positive common divisors of two integers A and B such that any two of these chosen divisors are coprime.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Finding Divisors**: The code correctly calculates the divisors of A and B by iterating from 1 up to the square root of each number and checking divisibility. It then appends both the divisor and its complement to the list of divisors.
  
2. **Checking Common Divisors**: The code checks which divisors of A are also divisors of B. For each common divisor, it uses the `func_1` function to check if the divisor is prime.

3. **Coprime Condition**: The problem requires that selected divisors be coprime. However, the code only checks if the common divisors are prime but does not ensure that any two selected divisors are coprime. For example, if both 4 and 6 are common divisors of A and B, they have a common divisor (2), hence they are not coprime. This crucial aspect is not handled in the code.

### Output Hints:
The hints state that the function determines if a number is prime and returns True for primes and False for 1 or non-prime numbers. While this is relevant to the logic of the program, it does not address the coprimality requirement for multiple divisors.

### Edge Cases:
- If A = 12 and B = 18, the common divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. Here, 1, 2, and 3 can be chosen since they are coprime. However, including 6 would violate the coprime condition when chosen with 2 or 3. The program does not have the logic to handle this overall selection of coprime divisors.
- If A = 30 and B = 45, the common divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The coprime selections would be 1, 3, and 5, but not 15 with either. This scenario is also not addressed.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code does not enforce the coprime condition for the selected common divisors, the implementation fails to fully comply with the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly implement the requirement for all chosen divisors to be coprime, as it only checks if they are prime without addressing the overall selection criteria for coprimality among potentially multiple divisors.
