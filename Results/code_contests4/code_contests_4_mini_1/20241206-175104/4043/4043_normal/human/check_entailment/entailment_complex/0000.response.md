Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program only checks if a single integer `n` is prime or not. It does not address the problem of finding the maximum number of coprime common divisors of two positive integers A and B, which is the requirement of the problem description.

In order to solve the problem, the program needs to:

1. **Find the common divisors** of A and B.
2. **Determine the coprimality** of these divisors.
3. **Count the maximum number of coprime common divisors**.

The annotated function does not implement any of these steps. It solely returns whether a single number is prime or not, which is unrelated to the task of counting coprime divisors of two given integers. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
