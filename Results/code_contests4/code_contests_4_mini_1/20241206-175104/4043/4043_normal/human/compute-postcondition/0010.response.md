According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. Since `n` is an odd integer at least 4, we need to calculate the upper limit for the loop.

The upper limit is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. Given that `n` is at least 4, `math.sqrt(n)` will be at least 2, making the minimum upper limit 3. If `n` is 9, for instance, the upper limit would be 4. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

In the current state, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be 4 or less. Therefore, we need to increment `k` to 4.

State: **`A` and `B` are positive integers, `n` is an odd integer at least 4, and `k` is 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `k` must be less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1**.
