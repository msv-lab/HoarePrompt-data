According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. The variable `k` starts at 2 and is increased by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Since `n` is at least 4 and odd, `int(math.sqrt(n))` will be at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must increment to the next value, which will be 3. 

Given that `k` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `k` will become 3. 

State: **`A` is a positive integer, `B` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `n` is odd)**
