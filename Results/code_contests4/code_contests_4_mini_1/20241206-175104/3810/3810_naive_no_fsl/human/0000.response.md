To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to understand the logic implemented in the function `func_19` which processes each university's query.

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make up an exact payment `ni` using coins with denominations ranging from `li` to `ri`. The program does this by using a binary search approach to check if there exists an integer `mid` such that the product of `li` and `mid` is less than or equal to `ni` (denoted as `x`), and the product of `ri` and `mid` is greater than or equal to `ni` (denoted as `y`). If such a `mid` exists, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

### Possible Edge Cases

1. **Exact Match with Limits**: If `ni` is exactly equal to `li` or `ri`, the program should return "Yes".
   - For example, for `ni = 5`, `li = 5`, `ri = 5` the output should be "Yes".

2. **Single Coin Denomination**: If `li` and `ri` are the same, then `ni` must be a multiple of this denomination.
   - For example, for `ni = 10`, `li = 5`, `ri = 5`, the output should be "Yes".

3. **No Valid Denominations**: If `ni` is less than `li`, the program should return "No".
   - For example, for `ni = 3`, `li = 5`, `ri = 5`, the output should be "No".

4. **Large Values**: Given `ni`, `li`, `ri` can be as large as `10^9`, the calculation in the loop must appropriately handle such large numbers without overflow or incorrect comparisons.

### Analyzing the Code

The binary search implemented in the code could potentially miss cases because it is trying to find a multiplier (`mid`) that satisfies the conditions `x <= n <= y`. However, there can be scenarios where:
- If `li` is significantly smaller than `ni` and `ri` is also significantly smaller than `ni`, it may not find the correct multiplier.
- The code does not handle cases where no valid coins can be used to sum to `ni` when `ni` is an integer that cannot be formed with the available denominations in the range.

### Example of Failure

Consider the case:
- `ni = 7`, `li = 2`, `ri = 3`. 
  - Here, Alexey can use coins of denominations 2 and 3 to pay. The combinations are:
     - 2 + 2 + 3 = 7
     - Thus, the output should be "Yes".

However, if we check a borderline case where `ni` is not achievable:
- `ni = 8`, `li = 3`, `ri = 4`.
  - Possible combinations are:
    - 3 + 3 + 3 (total = 9) 
    - 4 + 4 (total = 8) 
    - The program might incorrectly determine that `8` cannot be formed if the logic fails to check all combinations exhaustively.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic and considering potential edge cases, the program has not been designed to handle all possible scenarios correctly. There are instances where it may return incorrect results based on the specific values of `ni`, `li`, and `ri`.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
