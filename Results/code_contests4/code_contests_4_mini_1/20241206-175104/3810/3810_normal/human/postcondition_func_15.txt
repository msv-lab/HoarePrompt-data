The function accepts an integer `x`, which represents the number of universities, and a tuple `y` containing tuples of integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in `y`. However, if `y` is empty at the time of execution, the GCD calculation will not be valid, leading to an undefined result. Therefore, the function effectively returns the GCD of the integers in `y`, but if `y` is empty, it does not handle this case explicitly, potentially resulting in incorrect behavior.
