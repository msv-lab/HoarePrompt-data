The function accepts three positive integers `x`, `y`, and `p`, and returns `x` raised to the power of the number of 1s in the binary representation of `y`, modulo `p`. It effectively computes the modular exponentiation of `x` based on the binary representation of `y` without directly counting the number of 1s; instead, it incorporates this into the calculation through repeated squaring and multiplication. If `y` is 0, the function will return 1, because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
