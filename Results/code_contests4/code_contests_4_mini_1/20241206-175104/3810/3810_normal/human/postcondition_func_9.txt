The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers, and returns the list `x` along with a boolean indicating whether `x` is not empty and contains exactly one element that is a power of two. However, the current implementation does not check if any elements within the tuples are powers of two; it incorrectly evaluates the condition based solely on the list `x` itself. Therefore, the functionality is limited to checking the list's size and not the individual tuple elements.
