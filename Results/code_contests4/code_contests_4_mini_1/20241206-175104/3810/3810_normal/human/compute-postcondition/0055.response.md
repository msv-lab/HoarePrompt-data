The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid` where `l` is not defined, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` where `r` is not defined, the value of `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
