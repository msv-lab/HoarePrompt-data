Functionality: ** The function accepts variable arguments and keyword arguments, printing the values to a specified file (default is `sys.stdout`) with a specified separator and ending character. It does not actually process or utilize the integers representing the number of universities or their parameters; instead, it focuses on printing the provided arguments. If the 'flush' keyword argument is set to True, the output stream is flushed after printing.**
