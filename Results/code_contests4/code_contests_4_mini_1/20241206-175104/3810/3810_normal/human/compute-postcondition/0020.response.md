The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` attempts to write to the file using the value associated with the key 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary. If 'end' does not exist in `kwargs`, it defaults to writing a newline character (`'\n'`). 

Since `at_start` is False, it indicates that we have already written to the file (meaning `args` is not empty). Therefore, `at_start` remains unchanged and continues to be False.

The impact of the code on the program is that it will either write the value of `kwargs['end']` to the file if it exists, or write a newline character to the file if it does not.

The output state reflects that `at_start` is still False, and the file has been written to with either the specified 'end' value or a newline character.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, file is written with either `kwargs['end']` or a newline character**.
