The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is 500000000, this results in `low` being 500000001. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 500000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `r` is undefined, `y` cannot be assigned a value, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`low` is 500000001, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `r` is undefined, `y` cannot be assigned a value, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is less than `n`**.
