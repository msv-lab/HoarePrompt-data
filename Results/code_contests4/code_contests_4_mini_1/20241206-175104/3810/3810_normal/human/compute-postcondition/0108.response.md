The variable `x` is assigned the value `l * mid`. However, the variable `l` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the value of `x`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; and `x` cannot be determined since `l` is not defined.
Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; and `x` cannot be determined since `l` is not defined.**
