Postcondition: ***`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is less than `n`. `f` is set to 1 and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
