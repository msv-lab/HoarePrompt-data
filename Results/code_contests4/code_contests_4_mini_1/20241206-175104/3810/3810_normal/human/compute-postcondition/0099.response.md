The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `r` is undefined, `y` cannot be assigned a value; `n` is a value such that `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
