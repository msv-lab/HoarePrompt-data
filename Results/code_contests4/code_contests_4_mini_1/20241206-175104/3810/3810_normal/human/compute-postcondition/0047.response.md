The variable `high` is assigned the value `1000000000`. The previous values of the other variables (`low`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t`) remain unchanged as they retain the values returned by `func_3()`, and `low` was previously greater than `high`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `high` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain the values returned by `func_3()`; `high` is 1000000000**
