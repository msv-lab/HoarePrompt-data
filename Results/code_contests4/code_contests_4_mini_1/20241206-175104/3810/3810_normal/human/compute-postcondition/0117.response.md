`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` can be either 500000001 or 1, and `high` is at least 500000001, we can calculate the potential values for `mid`.

1. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 500000001, then:
   - `mid = (500000001 + 500000001) // 2 = 1000000002 // 2 = 500000001`

2. If `low` is 1 and `high` is 500000001, then:
   - `mid = (1 + 500000001) // 2 = 500000002 // 2 = 250000001`

Thus, `mid` can either be 500000001 or 250000001 depending on the value of `low`. The states of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` can be either 500000001 or 1; `high` can be at least 500000001; `mid` can be either 500000001 or 250000001.

Output State: **`low` can be either 500000001 or 1; `high` can be at least 500000001; `mid` can be either 500000001 or 250000001**
