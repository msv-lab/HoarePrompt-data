The function `func_20` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of universities, with the constraint that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each university, it accepts three additional parameters: `ni`, `li`, and `ri`, all of which are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq ni, li, ri \leq 10^9\) and \(li \leq ri\). 

The function evaluates the input parameters and returns a result based on the specified conditions for the universities. However, the exact output based on these parameters is not provided in the current context.
