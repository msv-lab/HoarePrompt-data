Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `mid` is either 375000000, 125000000, or 250000001; `x` is either 187500000375000000, 62500000125000000, 125000000750000001, 375000000, 125000000, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
