Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1 if there exists a `mid` such that `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `f` remains 0; `mid` holds the last computed value before exiting the loop; `x` and `y` are the last computed values based on the final `mid`, with `y` dependent on the value of `r`, which remains undefined.**
