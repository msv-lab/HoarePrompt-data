Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`. If `f` is 1, `mid` holds the last computed value before exiting the loop; `x` and `y` are the last computed values based on the final `mid`, with `y` dependent on the value of `r`, which remains undefined, and the function `func_20` has been called with the argument 'Yes'. If `f` is 0, `mid` holds the last computed value before exiting the loop; `x` and `y` are the last computed values based on the final `mid`, with `y` still dependent on the undefined value of `r`, and the function `func_20` is called with 'No' as an argument.***
