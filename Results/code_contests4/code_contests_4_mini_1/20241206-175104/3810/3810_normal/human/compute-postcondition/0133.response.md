The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes a series of queries, where each query consists of three integers: `ni`, `li`, and `ri`. Here, `ni` is the exact amount of money needed, and `li` and `ri` define the range of coin denominations that can be used. 

The function returns results based on these queries, but the specific outputs are not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a number of queries regarding coin denominations and the exact amount of money needed, but it does not accept parameters directly and the specific outputs based on the queries are not detailed.**
