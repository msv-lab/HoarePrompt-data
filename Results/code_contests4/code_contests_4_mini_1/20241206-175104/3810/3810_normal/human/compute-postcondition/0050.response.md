`mid` is assigned the value of (low + high) // 2. Given that `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, we calculate `mid` as follows: (1 + 1000000000) // 2 = 500000000. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000**
