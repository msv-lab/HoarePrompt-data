`mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of `(low + high)` by `2`. The possible values for `low` are either 500000001 or 1, and for `high` they are either 1000000000 or 499999999. 

Calculating for both scenarios:
1. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 1000000000, then:
   - `mid = (500000001 + 1000000000) // 2 = 750000000 // 2 = 750000000`

2. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 499999999, then:
   - This case is invalid since `low` cannot be greater than `high`.

3. If `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000, then:
   - `mid = (1 + 1000000000) // 2 = 1000000001 // 2 = 500000000`

4. If `low` is 1 and `high` is 499999999, then:
   - `mid = (1 + 499999999) // 2 = 500000000 // 2 = 250000000`

Thus, the possible values for `mid` are either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000, depending on the values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000.**
