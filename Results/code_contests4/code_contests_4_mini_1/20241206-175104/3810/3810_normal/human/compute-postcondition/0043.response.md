Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain the values returned by `func_3()`. If `f` is 1, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'Yes'. If `f` is 0, indicating that there does not exist a `mid` such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'No'.***
