The value of `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` can be either 500000001 or 250000001. Therefore, the new value of `high` will be either 500000001 - 1 = 500000000 or 250000001 - 1 = 250000000. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 500000000 or 250000000; `mid` is either 500000001 or 250000001; `x` is either 250000002500000001, 125000000250000001, 500000001, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined.**
