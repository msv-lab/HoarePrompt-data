Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1, `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999, `mid` is 500000000, `r` is undefined, `y` cannot be assigned a value, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`. If `y` is less than `n`, then `low` is 500000001, `high` is 1000000000, and `y` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, and `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
