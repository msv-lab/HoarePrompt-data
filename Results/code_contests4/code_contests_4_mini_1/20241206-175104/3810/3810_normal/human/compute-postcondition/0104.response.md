The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is 500000000, the new value of `high` will be 499999999. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `mid` is 500000000, `r` is undefined, `y` cannot be assigned a value, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 499999999, `mid` is 500000000, `r` is undefined, `y` cannot be assigned a value, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `n.**
