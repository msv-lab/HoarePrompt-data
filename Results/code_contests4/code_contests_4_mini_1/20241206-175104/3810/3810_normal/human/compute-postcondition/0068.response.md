Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is at least 500000001; `mid` is either 500000001 or 250000001; `x` is either 250000002500000001, 125000000250000001, 500000001, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.***
