Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1, `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, and if `y` is less than `n`, then `f` is set to 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `y` is not less than `n`, the execution also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
