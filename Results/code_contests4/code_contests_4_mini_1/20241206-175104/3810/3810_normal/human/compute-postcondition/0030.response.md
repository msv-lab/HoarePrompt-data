In the provided code, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. The values of `l` and `mid` are determined by the previous execution of `func_3()` and the calculation using `low` and `high`. Therefore, `x` will take on the value of `l` multiplied by the result of `(low + high) // 2`. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2; `x` is equal to `l * mid`**
