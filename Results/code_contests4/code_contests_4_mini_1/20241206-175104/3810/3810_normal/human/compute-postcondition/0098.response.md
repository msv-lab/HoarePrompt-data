The value of `f` is assigned to 1, and it does not affect any other variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `r` is undefined, `y` cannot be assigned a value. `n` is a value such that `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`; `f` is 1.
