The value of `low` is assigned to 1, but since `low` was previously stated to be greater than `high`, the relationship remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `r`, and `t`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain the values returned by `func_3()`, and `low` was previously greater than `high`.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain the values returned by `func_3()`, and `low` was previously greater than `high**
