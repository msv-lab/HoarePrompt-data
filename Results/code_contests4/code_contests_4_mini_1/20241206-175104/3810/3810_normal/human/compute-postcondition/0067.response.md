The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is at least 500000001; `mid` is either 500000001 or 250000001; `x` is either 250000002500000001, 125000000250000001, 500000001, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
