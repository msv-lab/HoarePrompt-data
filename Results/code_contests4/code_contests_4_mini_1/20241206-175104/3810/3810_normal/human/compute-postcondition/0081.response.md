Postcondition: ***`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `mid` is either 375000000, 125000000, or 250000001; `x` is either 187500000375000000, 62500000125000000, 125000000750000001, 375000000, 125000000, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. If `y` is less than `n`, then `low` is updated to either 375000001, 125000001, or 250000002. Otherwise, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1` while keeping `low` unchanged.***
