Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`; `low` is equal to `high`; `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2; `x` is equal to `l * mid`; `y` is equal to `r * mid`. If `y` is less than `n`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
