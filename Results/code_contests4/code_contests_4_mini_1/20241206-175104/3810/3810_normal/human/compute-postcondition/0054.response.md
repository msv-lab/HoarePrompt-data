The value of `f` is assigned the value of 1, and since no other variables are affected, the values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid` where `l` is not defined, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` where `r` is not defined, the value of `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`; `f` is 1.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid` where `l` is not defined, `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` where `r` is not defined, the value of `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`; `f` is 1.**
