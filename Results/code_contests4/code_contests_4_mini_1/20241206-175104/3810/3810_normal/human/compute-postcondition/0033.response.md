The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`; `low` is equal to `high`; `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2; `x` is equal to `l * mid`; `y` is equal to `r * mid`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
