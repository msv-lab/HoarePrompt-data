According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is set to False, indicating that the loop has already started executing. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `x` must be assigned the next element in the `args` iterable.

State: **`at_start` is set to False, for the loop to execute one more time `args` must have at least one more element, and `x` is the next element in `args`.**
