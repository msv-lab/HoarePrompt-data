Postcondition: ***`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is either 0 or 1, indicating whether a valid `mid` was found such that `l * mid <= n <= r * mid`. If `f` is 1, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'Yes'. If `f` is 0, the function `func_20` is called with the argument 'No'. Additionally, `high` is less than `low`, and `mid`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned respective values during the iterations.***
