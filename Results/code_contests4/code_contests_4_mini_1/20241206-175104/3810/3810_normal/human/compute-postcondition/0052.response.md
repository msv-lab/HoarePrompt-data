The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. However, the variable `r` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the value of `y`. The other variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, and `x`) remain unaffected since their values are not changed by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid` where `l` is not defined, and `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` where `r` is not defined.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid` where `l` is not defined, and `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid` where `r` is not defined.**
