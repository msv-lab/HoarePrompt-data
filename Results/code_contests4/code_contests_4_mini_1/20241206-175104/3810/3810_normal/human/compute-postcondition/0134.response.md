Functionality: ** The function processes a series of queries where each query consists of three integers representing the exact amount of money needed (`n`) and the range of coin denominations (`l` to `r`). For each query, it determines if there exists a positive integer multiplier (`mid`) such that the amount represented by `l * mid` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `r * mid`. If such a multiplier exists for a query, it outputs 'Yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters directly, and the specific outputs depend on the results of these queries. **
