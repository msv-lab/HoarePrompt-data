The value of `mid` is assigned the result of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` can be either 500000001 or 1, and `high` is at least 500000001, we can evaluate the possible values for `mid`:

1. If `low` is 500000001 and `high` is 500000001 (the minimum value), then `mid` would be `(500000001 + 500000001) // 2 = 500000001`.
2. If `low` is 1 and `high` is 500000001, then `mid` would be `(1 + 500000001) // 2 = 250000001`.

Thus, `mid` can be either 500000001 or 250000001 depending on the value of `low`. The states of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is at least 500000001; `mid` is either 500000001 or 250000001.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is at least 500000001; `mid` is either 500000001 or 250000001**
