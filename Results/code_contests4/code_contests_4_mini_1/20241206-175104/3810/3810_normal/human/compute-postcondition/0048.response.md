The variable `f` is initialized to 0. The values of `low`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` remain unchanged as they retain the values returned by `func_3()`. Since no other operations are performed, the output state reflects the current values of all affected variables. 

Output State: **`low` is 1, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain the values returned by `func_3()`; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 0**
