Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is 1, `mid` holds the last computed value before exiting the loop; `x` and `y` are the last computed values based on the final `mid`, with `y` dependent on the value of `r`, which remains undefined; the function `func_20` has been called with the argument 'Yes'.**
