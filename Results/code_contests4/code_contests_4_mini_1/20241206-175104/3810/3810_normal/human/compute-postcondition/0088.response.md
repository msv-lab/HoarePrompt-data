According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than the number of times the loop has executed so far, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is greater than `high`, which suggests that the condition for the loop is related to the return value of `func_1()`. Since `high` is less than `low`, we need to take into account that `func_1()` must return a value that allows for another iteration. 

Given that the loop has already executed at least once, we need to ensure that the state reflects this and prepares for another iteration. Therefore, the next state must show that the loop has executed once more. 

State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `f` is either 0 or 1, `high` is still less than `low`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned respective values during the iterations, for the loop to execute a second time `func_1()` must return a value greater than 1.**
