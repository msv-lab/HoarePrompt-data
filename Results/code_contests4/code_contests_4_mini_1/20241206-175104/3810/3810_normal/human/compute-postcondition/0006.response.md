Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of universities, `ni`, `li`, `ri` are integers such that (1 ≤ `ni`, `li`, `ri` ≤ 10^9) and `li` ≤ `ri`; `sep` is either a specified separator or a space; `file` is either a specified file or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is set to False; `args` is a non-empty iterable; `x` is the first element of `args`; if `at_start` is False, a separator `sep` is written to `file`.***
