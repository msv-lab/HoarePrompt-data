Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); `n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`; `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. If `y` is less than `n`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or statement. Otherwise, if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or statement, while `low` is now `mid + 1`.***
