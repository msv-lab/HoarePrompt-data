According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is greater than `high`, and `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain the values returned by `func_3()`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred (which is currently the iteration count). Since we are not given the exact count of previous iterations, we assume that it was `k`, where `k` is the current number of iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than `k`.

State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `t` retain the values returned by `func_3()`, for the loop to execute one more time `func_1()` must return a value greater than the number of completed iterations (k)**
