The variable `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. However, the value of `l` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot calculate a specific value for `x`. The variable `mid` is 500000000. Therefore, we can only state that `x` is dependent on the value of `l`. 

The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid` where `l` is not defined.**
