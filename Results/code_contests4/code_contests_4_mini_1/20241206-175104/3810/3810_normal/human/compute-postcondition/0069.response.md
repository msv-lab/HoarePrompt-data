The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` can be either 500000001 or 250000001, so the new value of `low` can be either 500000002 or 250000002. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000002 or 250000002; `high` is at least 500000001; `mid` is either 500000001 or 250000001; `x` is either 250000002500000001, 125000000250000001, 500000001, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000002 or 250000002; `high` is at least 500000001; `mid` is either 500000001 or 250000001; `x` is either 250000002500000001, 125000000250000001, 500000001, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined.**
