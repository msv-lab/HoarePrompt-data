Postcondition: ***`low` can be either 500000001 or 1; `high` can be either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` can be either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `y` cannot be determined since `r` is not defined. If `y` is less than `n`, and if `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, `low` can be either 500000001 or 1; `high` can be either 749999999, 499999999, or 249999999; `mid` can be either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; `y` cannot be determined since `r` is not defined. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
