Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer; `n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`; `low` is equal to `high`; `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2; `x` is equal to `l * mid`; `y` is equal to `r * mid`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
