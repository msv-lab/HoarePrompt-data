The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, but since `r` is not defined, we cannot determine the value of `y`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; and `y` cannot be determined since `r` is not defined.

Output State: **`low` is either 500000001 or 1; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `mid` is either 750000000, 500000000, or 250000000; and `y` cannot be determined since `r` is not defined.**
