The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is either 500000001 or 1; `mid` is either 375000000, 125000000, or 250000001; `x` is either 187500000375000000, 62500000125000000, 125000000750000001, 375000000, 125000000, or 250000001; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; `f` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
