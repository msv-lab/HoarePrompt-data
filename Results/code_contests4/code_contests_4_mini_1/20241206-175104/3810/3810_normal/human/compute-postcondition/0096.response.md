The variable `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `r` is undefined. Since `r` does not have a value, the assignment cannot be completed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `r` is undefined and `y` cannot be assigned a value.

Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000; `r` is undefined and `y` cannot be assigned a value.**
