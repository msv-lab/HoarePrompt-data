Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000); `n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`; `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2; `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`; `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`; `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or statement.**
