You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alexey, a merry Berland entrant, got sick of the gray reality and he zealously wants to go to university. There are a lot of universities nowadays, so Alexey is getting lost in the diversity — he has not yet decided what profession he wants to get. At school, he had bad grades in all subjects, and it's only thanks to wealthy parents that he was able to obtain the graduation certificate.

The situation is complicated by the fact that each high education institution has the determined amount of voluntary donations, paid by the new students for admission — ni berubleys. He cannot pay more than ni, because then the difference between the paid amount and ni can be regarded as a bribe!

Each rector is wearing the distinctive uniform of his university. Therefore, the uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of denomination more than ri. The rector also does not carry coins of denomination less than li in his pocket — because if everyone pays him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight and the pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of denomination x berubleys, where li ≤ x ≤ ri (Berland uses coins of any positive integer denomination). Alexey can use the coins of different denominations and he can use the coins of the same denomination any number of times. When Alexey was first confronted with such orders, he was puzzled because it turned out that not all universities can accept him! Alexey is very afraid of going into the army (even though he had long wanted to get the green uniform, but his dad says that the army bullies will beat his son and he cannot pay to ensure the boy's safety). So, Alexey wants to know for sure which universities he can enter so that he could quickly choose his alma mater.

Thanks to the parents, Alexey is not limited in money and we can assume that he has an unlimited number of coins of each type.

In other words, you are given t requests, each of them contains numbers ni, li, ri. For each query you need to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri berubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each denomination can be used any number of times.

Input

The first line contains the number of universities t, (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) Each of the next t lines contain three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 109; li ≤ ri).

Output

For each query print on a single line: either "Yes", if Alexey can enter the university, or "No" otherwise.

Examples

Input

2
5 2 3
6 4 5


Output

Yes
No

Note

You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins: one of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the second university cannot be paid.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input value representing the number of universities. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a valid integer, which could lead to runtime errors if the input is malformed.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns user input, which consists of integers `ni`, `li`, and `ri` for each university request. It does not directly process or validate the number of university requests (`t`) or the constraints of the input values.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input string, which consists of space-separated integers. The integers should be within the bounds of 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9, and the condition li ≤ ri is expected to hold, but this condition is not enforced within the function. The function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function does not take any parameters and returns a map object containing the string representations of the integers read from standard input, including an integer `t` followed by `t` sets of three space-separated integers `(ni, li, ri)`. The function assumes that valid input will always be provided, with `t` ranging from 1 to 1000 and each of `ni`, `li`, and `ri` being within the range of 1 to 10^9. No error handling is in place for invalid input or empty input cases.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The returned list is based on the processing of the positive integer `t`, which represents the number of universities and their corresponding attributes (ni, li, ri), although this function does not directly handle the input or any logic related to it. The behavior of `func_3()` is not specified here, which means the specifics of what the list contains cannot be determined from the provided code. Therefore, the function relies entirely on `func_3()` to generate the output, and any edge cases or conditions must be considered there.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` initializes a new thread and starts it, targeting a function named `main`. It sets the recursion limit and stack size for the thread. However, the function does not accept any parameters, and there is no handling of the positive integer `t` or the parameters `ni`, `li`, and `ri` mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the functionality in the annotations does not align with the actual code. The function lacks the implementation to process the university requests as described.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a list of tuples called `item`, where each tuple contains three integers representing donation amounts and coin denomination limits. It specifically returns the second tuple in the list without any validation or checks for the length of the list, which could lead to an IndexError if the list contains fewer than two tuples.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns the list sorted in descending order based on a custom sorting criteria defined in the `getKey` function. It assumes that the input list is valid and does not handle any edge cases such as empty lists or malformed tuples.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `num`, and returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is the value of `num`. The function does not perform any validation on the input values.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts a list of tuples `x`, where each tuple contains three integers, and returns the list `x` along with a boolean indicating whether `x` is not empty and contains exactly one element that is a power of two. However, the current implementation does not check if any elements within the tuples are powers of two; it incorrectly evaluates the condition based solely on the list `x` itself. Therefore, the functionality is limited to checking the list's size and not the individual tuple elements.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It converts the list to an integer (which may not accurately represent the intended values) and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function does not consider how the conversion of the list to an integer is intended to work with the tuple structure, which may lead to unexpected results.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns a list of integers that represents the decimal digits of the string conversion of the entire list of tuples concatenated together, rather than individual integers from the tuples. This behavior may not align with the intended purpose as described in the annotations.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the donation amount and an integer `r` which is expected to represent the number of coins. It calculates and returns the number of ways to distribute `n` units of donation into `r` distinct parts using the combination formula. However, the code does not handle the list of tuples `r` correctly, as it treats `r` as a single integer instead of the number of queries, which could lead to incorrect calculations or errors. The function does not consider the details contained within the tuples of `r`, nor does it validate the input types or constraints, which could lead to runtime errors if the inputs are not as expected.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list `y` of tuples, but it incorrectly attempts to perform division of `x` by `y`, which is not valid in Python. If `x` is divisible by the number of tuples in `y`, it is supposed to return the result of that division; otherwise, it adds 1 to the integer division result. However, due to the improper operation, the function will raise a TypeError, as you cannot divide an integer by a list. The correct behavior for this function is not implemented.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts three positive integers `x`, `y`, and `p`, and returns `x` raised to the power of the number of 1s in the binary representation of `y`, modulo `p`. It effectively computes the modular exponentiation of `x` based on the binary representation of `y` without directly counting the number of 1s; instead, it incorporates this into the calculation through repeated squaring and multiplication. If `y` is 0, the function will return 1, because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts an integer `x`, which represents the number of universities, and a tuple `y` containing tuples of integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in `y`. However, if `y` is empty at the time of execution, the GCD calculation will not be valid, leading to an undefined result. Therefore, the function effectively returns the GCD of the integers in `y`, but if `y` is empty, it does not handle this case explicitly, potentially resulting in incorrect behavior.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns `False` if the length of `n` is less than or equal to 1, or if the length of `n` is greater than 3 and is divisible by 2 or 3. It also returns `False` if the length of `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself, specifically checking against potential divisors starting from 5. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the length of `n` is a prime number. The function does not utilize the contents of the tuples in `n` for any calculations, which is a notable omission.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function accepts no parameters and reads input from a file named 'input.txt' while writing output to a file named 'output.txt'. It is intended to process a series of queries defined by three integers (ni, li, ri) for each query, but the actual logic for processing these queries is not implemented within the function, meaning that it does not return any results or handle the queries as described in the annotations.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        (n, l, r) = func_3()
        low = 1
        high = 1000000000
        f = 0
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            x = l * mid
            y = r * mid
            if x <= n and n <= y:
                f = 1
                break
            if y < n:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        if f:
            func_20('Yes')
        else:
            func_20('No')
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function processes a series of queries where each query consists of three integers representing the exact amount of money needed (`n`) and the range of coin denominations (`l` to `r`). For each query, it determines if there exists a positive integer multiplier (`mid`) such that the amount represented by `l * mid` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `r * mid`. If such a multiplier exists for a query, it outputs 'Yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters directly, and the specific outputs depend on the results of these queries.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
