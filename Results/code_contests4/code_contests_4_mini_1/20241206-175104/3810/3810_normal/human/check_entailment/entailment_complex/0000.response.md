To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the entire flow of the code and how it relates to the requirements specified.

### Problem Overview
The problem requires determining if Alexey can pay a donation amount `ni` using coins with denominations that fall within a specified range `[li, ri]`. The output for each query must be "Yes" if it is possible to pay exactly `ni` using the allowed denominations, otherwise "No". 

### Annotations and Functions
From the analysis of the functions and their annotations:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are responsible for reading input. They seem to handle the input properly as they read the number of universities and their corresponding parameters.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The main logic resides in `func_19`, which processes each query. The method attempts to find a multiplier `mid` such that:
     - \( l \times mid \leq n \leq r \times mid \)
   - This logic aims to determine if there exists a valid multiplier that allows forming the exact sum `n` with denominations ranging from `l` to `r`. 

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The output is handled by `func_20`, which prints "Yes" or "No" based on the results of each query.

### Potential Cases
Now, let's consider potential edge cases that could break the logic:

1. **Exact Coin Requirement**:
   - If `ni` is less than `li`, it is impossible to pay the exact amount since all denominations are too high.
   - If `ni` is greater than `ri`, similarly, it cannot be paid because all denominations are too low.

2. **No Valid Multipliers**:
   - If the range of denominations `[li, ri]` does not allow for the exact sum `ni` to be formed when multiplied by any integer, the output should be "No".

### Specific Example from the Problem:
Let's analyze an example:
- Input: `ni = 6`, `li = 4`, `ri = 5`.
- The only denominations available are 4 and 5. The combinations (4, 5) do not allow forming the number 6 (as 4 cannot pair with any multiple to reach 6, and 5 is also too high).
- The expected output is "No".

### Conclusion
After examining the flow through the functions and understanding how they relate to the problem description, I found that the core logic in `func_19` fails to account for cases where `ni` is not reachable using the given denominations in certain scenarios.

For instance, if `ni` is smaller than `li`, or if both `li` and `ri` are too far apart from `ni`, the existing binary search logic may not correctly identify that no valid combinations exist. 

Thus, the program does not correctly cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.

**Correctness: False**  
The program fails to return the correct output for cases where `ni` is less than `li` or where no valid multiplier can satisfy the equation \( l \times mid \leq n \leq r \times mid \) for all valid `mid`.
