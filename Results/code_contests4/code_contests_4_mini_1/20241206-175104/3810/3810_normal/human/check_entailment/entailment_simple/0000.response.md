Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether Alexey can make the donation using the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic Flaw in Donation Calculation**: The core requirement is to check if Alexey can pay exactly `ni` berubleys using coins with denominations between `li` and `ri`. The program attempts to use a binary search method to find a suitable `mid`, which is not the correct approach for this problem. It doesn't adequately check the combinations of coin denominations to determine if `ni` can be constructed.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The program seems to treat the problem as a range checking issue rather than a combinatorial one. The conditions `x <= n and n <= y` are not sufficient to determine if the exact sum can be made. The solution requires checking if there exists a combination of coin denominations within the specified range that sums exactly to `ni`. 

3. **Output Handling**: The function `func_20` is not implemented correctly for producing the desired output. The way it handles printing results does not align with the expected output format ("Yes" or "No").

4. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not adequately consider cases where the exact amount cannot be formed at all. For example, if `ni` is less than `li`, it should immediately return "No".

In summary, the logic for determining if the exact donation can be paid using the specified coin denominations is flawed, leading to potential incorrect results. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
