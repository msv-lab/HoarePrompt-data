The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It converts the list to an integer (which may not accurately represent the intended values) and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function does not consider how the conversion of the list to an integer is intended to work with the tuple structure, which may lead to unexpected results.
