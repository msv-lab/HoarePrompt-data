The function accepts a positive integer `x` and a list `y` of tuples, but it incorrectly attempts to perform division of `x` by `y`, which is not valid in Python. If `x` is divisible by the number of tuples in `y`, it is supposed to return the result of that division; otherwise, it adds 1 to the integer division result. However, due to the improper operation, the function will raise a TypeError, as you cannot divide an integer by a list. The correct behavior for this function is not implemented.
