The function does not take any parameters and returns a map object containing the string representations of the integers read from standard input, including an integer `t` followed by `t` sets of three space-separated integers `(ni, li, ri)`. The function assumes that valid input will always be provided, with `t` ranging from 1 to 1000 and each of `ni`, `li`, and `ri` being within the range of 1 to 10^9. No error handling is in place for invalid input or empty input cases.
