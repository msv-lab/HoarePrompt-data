The function `func_6` initializes a new thread and starts it, targeting a function named `main`. It sets the recursion limit and stack size for the thread. However, the function does not accept any parameters, and there is no handling of the positive integer `t` or the parameters `ni`, `li`, and `ri` mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the functionality in the annotations does not align with the actual code. The function lacks the implementation to process the university requests as described.
