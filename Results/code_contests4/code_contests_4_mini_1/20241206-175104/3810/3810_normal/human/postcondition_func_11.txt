The function accepts a list of tuples `n`, where each tuple contains three integers. It returns a list of integers that represents the decimal digits of the string conversion of the entire list of tuples concatenated together, rather than individual integers from the tuples. This behavior may not align with the intended purpose as described in the annotations.
