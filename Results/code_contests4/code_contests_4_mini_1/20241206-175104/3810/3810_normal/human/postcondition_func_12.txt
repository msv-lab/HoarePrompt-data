The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the donation amount and an integer `r` which is expected to represent the number of coins. It calculates and returns the number of ways to distribute `n` units of donation into `r` distinct parts using the combination formula. However, the code does not handle the list of tuples `r` correctly, as it treats `r` as a single integer instead of the number of queries, which could lead to incorrect calculations or errors. The function does not consider the details contained within the tuples of `r`, nor does it validate the input types or constraints, which could lead to runtime errors if the inputs are not as expected.
