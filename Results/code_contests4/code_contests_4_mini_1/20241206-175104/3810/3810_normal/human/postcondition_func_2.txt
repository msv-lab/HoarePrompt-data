The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input string, which consists of space-separated integers. The integers should be within the bounds of 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9, and the condition li ≤ ri is expected to hold, but this condition is not enforced within the function. The function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input.
