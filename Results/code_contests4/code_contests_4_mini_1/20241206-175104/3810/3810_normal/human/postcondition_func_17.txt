The function accepts no parameters and reads input from a file named 'input.txt' while writing output to a file named 'output.txt'. It is intended to process a series of queries defined by three integers (ni, li, ri) for each query, but the actual logic for processing these queries is not implemented within the function, meaning that it does not return any results or handle the queries as described in the annotations.
