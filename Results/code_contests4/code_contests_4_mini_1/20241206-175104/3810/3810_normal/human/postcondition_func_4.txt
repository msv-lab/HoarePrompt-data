The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The returned list is based on the processing of the positive integer `t`, which represents the number of universities and their corresponding attributes (ni, li, ri), although this function does not directly handle the input or any logic related to it. The behavior of `func_3()` is not specified here, which means the specifics of what the list contains cannot be determined from the provided code. Therefore, the function relies entirely on `func_3()` to generate the output, and any edge cases or conditions must be considered there.
