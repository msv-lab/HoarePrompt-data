To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it handles all possible inputs correctly.

The problem states that Alexey wants to determine if he can pay exactly `ni` berubleys using coins of denominations between `li` and `ri`. The key points to consider are:
1. Alexey can use any positive integer denominations between `li` and `ri`.
2. He can use these denominations any number of times.
3. We need to check if it is possible to exactly sum up to `ni` using the allowed coin denominations.

The program implementation attempts to solve this by using a binary search approach, where it calculates how many coins of the minimum denomination (`l`) and maximum denomination (`r`) would be needed to reach `ni`. However, there are some logical flaws in this approach.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The condition `if x <= n and n <= y:` checks if `n` can be formed using the denominations but it doesn't ensure that the increments of the coins between `l` and `r` can actually sum to `n`. 
2. If `l` and `r` are equal, the only denomination available is `l` (or `r`), and the only valid `n` must be a multiple of `l`. The code does not handle this case correctly.
3. The binary search approach assumes that if `n` is between the range of multiples of `l` and `r`, it can be formed, which is not necessarily true due to the restrictions of denominations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where:
- `ni = 5`, `li = 3`, `ri = 3`. 

In this case, Alexey can only use coins of denomination 3. The possible sums he can make is limited to multiples of 3 (i.e., 3, 6, 9, ...). Therefore, it is impossible to form exactly 5 berubleys. The program would incorrectly return "Yes" due to the way it checks the range without considering the exact multiples.

### Conclusion:
As the program can produce incorrect results for valid input cases where the conditions of the problem are not respected, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
