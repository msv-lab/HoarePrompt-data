Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. Additionally, `sys.stdin.readlines()` will read all the lines at once, which may not be appropriate for the intended use case where logs can be processed line by line.

2. **Datetime Handling**: The program processes logs but does not correctly account for the time window defined by `n` seconds. Specifically, the way `last` is incremented may lead to incorrect counts of logs that fall within the last `n` seconds, especially since `last` is being incremented for each log entry that is older than `n` seconds. This results in potentially skipping valid logs that should have been counted.

3. **Output Logic**: The program prints the timestamp of the current log entry when there are at least `m` entries within the last `n` seconds. However, it does not handle the case where there are no such entries effectively. If the conditions are not met throughout the loop, there is no explicit return or print statement for `-1`, which is required by the problem description.

4. **Final Output**: The function does not have a defined way to output `-1` when the conditions are not met after processing all logs. This is a critical requirement stated in the problem description.

In summary, the program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem as described, particularly in how it manages log entries and outputs the result.
