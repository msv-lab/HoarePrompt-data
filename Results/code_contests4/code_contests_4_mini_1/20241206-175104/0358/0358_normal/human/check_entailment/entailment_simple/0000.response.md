To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step against the requirements outlined in the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the time window in seconds and the minimum number of warnings required within that window, respectively. This is correctly handled with `map(int, raw_input().split())`.

2. **Log Stream Processing**: 
   - The program reads the log records using `log = sys.stdin.readlines()`, which is appropriate for capturing all log entries.
   - Each log record is expected to be in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE", and the program extracts the date and time correctly using string manipulation and the `datetime` library. This ensures that the date and time are properly formatted.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program maintains a list `logtime` that stores the parsed datetime objects for the log entries.
   - It uses a sliding window approach with the variable `last` to track how many logs fall within the last `n` seconds from the current log time. This part is crucial as it determines if the number of warnings in the specified range meets or exceeds `m`.
   - The loop iterates over `logtime[last:]`, calculating the time difference between the current log time and the logged times to update `last` appropriately.

4. **Output Requirements**:
   - The program checks if the count of log entries within the time window is greater than or equal to `m`. If so, it outputs the timestamp of the current log entry.
   - If no such condition is met after processing all log entries, it is supposed to print `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where logs might be close to the edges of a minute or hour, as it uses `datetime` objects that accurately manage date and time calculations.

### Conclusion

The program adheres to the problem description in terms of input requirements, processing logic, and output generation. It correctly identifies the first moment in time when the number of warnings for the last `n` seconds meets or exceeds `m`.

Given that the program meets all the requirements laid out in the problem description and handles the edge cases appropriately, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
