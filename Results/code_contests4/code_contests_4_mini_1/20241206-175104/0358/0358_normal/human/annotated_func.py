#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000, and the log stream contains at least one record formatted as "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE" with correct date and time.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    log = sys.stdin.readlines()
    logtime = []
    last = 0
    for line in log:
        a = line.find(' ')
        
        year, month, day = map(int, line[:a].split('-'))
        
        b = line.rfind(':')
        
        hour, minute, second = map(int, line[a:b].split(':'))
        
        now = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
        
        logtime.append(now)
        
        print(line[:b], last)
        
        for x in logtime[last:]:
            delta = int((now - x).total_seconds())
            print(delta)
            if delta >= n:
                last += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if len(logtime) - last >= m:
            print(line[:b])
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is a list containing datetime objects collected from the log; `last` is the count of datetime objects in `logtime` that are at least `n` seconds old; if the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the last processed log line up to index `b` is printed; if not, -1 is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, from user input and processes a log stream formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE". It converts the timestamps in the log into datetime objects and checks if there are at least `m` log entries that are at least `n` seconds old from the current log entry being processed. If such entries exist, it prints the timestamp of the current log entry; otherwise, it does not explicitly return a value or prints -1. Note that if there are no entries that meet the criteria, the function may not handle this situation effectively, as it lacks a defined return or output for cases where the specified conditions are not met.
