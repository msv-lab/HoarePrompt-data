The code reads all lines from standard input into the variable `log`. The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged since they are not impacted by this operation. The output state reflects that `log` now contains the lines read from the input, while `n` and `m` retain their previous integer values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers assigned from the input, `log` contains lines read from standard input**.
