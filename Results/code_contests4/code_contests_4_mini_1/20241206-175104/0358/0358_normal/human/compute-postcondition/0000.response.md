The variables `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input, which is provided in a space-separated format. The function `map(int, raw_input().split())` will read these values, convert them to integers, and assign them to `n` and `m`. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified beyond the condition that they are integers within the range of 1 to 10000. Therefore, after execution, `n` and `m` will hold the integer values provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers assigned from the input, both within the range of 1 to 10000.**
