Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is a list containing datetime objects; `last` is the number of datetime objects in `logtime` such that the difference between `now` and each datetime object is greater than or equal to `n`; `delta` is the total seconds between `now` and the last datetime object checked before the loop exited; `a` is the index of the first space in `line`; `year`, `month`, and `day` are integers derived from `line[:a].split('-'); `b` is the index of the last occurrence of ':' in `line`; `hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned the values derived from splitting the substring `line[a:b]` into integers.**
