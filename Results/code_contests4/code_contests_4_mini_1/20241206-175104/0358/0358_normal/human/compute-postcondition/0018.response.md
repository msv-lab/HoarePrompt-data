The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers, `logtime` is a list containing at least 1 datetime object, `last` is 0, `x` is the first datetime object in `logtime`, `delta` is the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `delta` is printed, and additionally, `delta` is less than `n`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `logtime` is a list containing at least 1 datetime object, `last` is 0, `x` is the first datetime object in `logtime`, `delta` is the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `delta` is printed, and additionally, `delta` is less than `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
