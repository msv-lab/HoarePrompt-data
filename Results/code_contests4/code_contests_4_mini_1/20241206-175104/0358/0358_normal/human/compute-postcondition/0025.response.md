Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is a list containing at least 2 datetime objects. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is updated to 2 and `delta` remains the total seconds between `now` and `x`. Otherwise, `last` remains 1, `delta` is still the total seconds between `now` and `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
