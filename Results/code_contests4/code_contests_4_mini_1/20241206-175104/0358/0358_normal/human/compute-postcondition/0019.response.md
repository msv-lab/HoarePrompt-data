Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `logtime` is a list containing at least 1 datetime object, `last` is updated to 1 if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `delta` is printed. If `delta` is less than `n`, `last` remains 0, `delta` is printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
