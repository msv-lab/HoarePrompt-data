The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values parsed from the substring of `line` between indices `a` and `b`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the value of `now`; `last` is increased by 1; `last` is less than the length of `logtime`; `delta` is assigned the value of int((now - x).total_seconds()); the value of `delta` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
