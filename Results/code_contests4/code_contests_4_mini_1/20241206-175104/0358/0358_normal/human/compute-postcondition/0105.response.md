Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, from user input and processes a log stream formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE". It converts the timestamps in the log into datetime objects and checks if there are at least `m` log entries that are at least `n` seconds old from the current log entry being processed. If such entries exist, it prints the timestamp of the current log entry; otherwise, it does not explicitly return a value or prints -1. Note that if there are no entries that meet the criteria, the function may not handle this situation effectively, as it lacks a defined return or output for cases where the specified conditions are not met. **
