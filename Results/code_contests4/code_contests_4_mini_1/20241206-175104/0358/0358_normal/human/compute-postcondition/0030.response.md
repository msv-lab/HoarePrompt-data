The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers, `logtime` is a list containing at least 2 datetime objects, `last` is 2, `x` is the third datetime object in the list, `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
