Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values parsed from the substring of `line` between indices `a` and `b`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the value of `now`; `last` is increased by 1 and is less than the length of `logtime`; `x` is the next value from `logtime` starting from index `last`; `delta` is the integer value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`; if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `delta` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `delta` is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
