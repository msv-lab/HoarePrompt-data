Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values parsed from the substring of `line` between indices `a` and `b`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the value of `now`; `last` is equal to the length of `logtime` or the first index where `delta` is less than `n`; if the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `delta` is printed for each value of `x` in `logtime` that meets the condition prior to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
