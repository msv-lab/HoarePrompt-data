The code snippet assigns values to `year`, `month`, and `day` by splitting the substring of `line` up to the index `a` using the delimiter `'-'`, and then mapping the split string values to integers. The variable `line` is expected to contain a date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` or similar. The values of `year`, `month`, and `day` will be determined based on the contents of `line` up to index `a`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `logtime`, `last`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is an empty list; `last` is 0; `a` is the index of the first space in `line` or -1 if no space is found; `year`, `month`, `day` are assigned integer values from the split string of `line[:a]`.**
