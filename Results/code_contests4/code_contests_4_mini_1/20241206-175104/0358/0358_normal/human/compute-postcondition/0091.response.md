Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values parsed from the substring of `line` between indices `a` and `b`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the value of `now`; `last` is increased by 1 and is less than the length of `logtime`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `delta` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `delta` is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
