Postcondition: ***`now` is a datetime object created from the values of `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`; `last` is the count of elements in `logtime` that are at least `n` seconds old; `logtime` remains unchanged; `delta` is less than `n` for the last element processed; if the number of elements in `logtime` that are not counted in `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, `line` is printed up to index `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
