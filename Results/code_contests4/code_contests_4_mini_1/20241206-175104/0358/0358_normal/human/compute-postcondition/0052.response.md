Postcondition: ***`now` is a datetime object created from the values of `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 0; `x` is the element in `logtime` at index `last`, and `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`, which is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `last` remains less than the length of `logtime`; `x` is the element in `logtime` at index `last`; `delta` is less than `n`, and `delta` is printed while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
