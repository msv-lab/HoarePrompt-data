The code assigns values to `year`, `month`, and `day` by splitting the substring of `line` up to the index `a` using the '-' character. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the split string values into integers. 

Given that `line[:a]` is a string formatted as "year-month-day", the outputs of `year`, `month`, and `day` will be derived from this string, and their specific values will depend on the contents of `line` up to index `a`.

Since the other variables (`n`, `m`, `logtime`, `last`, `delta`) are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is a list containing datetime objects; `last` is the number of datetime objects in `logtime` such that the difference between `now` and each datetime object is greater than or equal to `n`; `delta` is the total seconds between `now` and the last datetime object checked before the loop exited; `a` is the index of the first space in `line`; `year`, `month`, and `day` are integers derived from `line[:a].split('-')`.**
