Output State: **`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values parsed from the substring of `line` between indices `a` and `b`; `now` is a datetime object; `logtime` includes the value of `now`; for the loop to execute the first time, `last` is less than the length of `logtime` and `x` is `logtime[last]`; `delta` is calculated as the integer value of total seconds between `now` and `x`; `delta` is printed; and `delta` is greater than or equal to `n; last` is increased by 1.**
