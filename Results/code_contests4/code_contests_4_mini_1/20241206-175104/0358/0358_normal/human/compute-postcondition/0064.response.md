Postcondition: ***`now` is a datetime object, `last` is at least 1, `logtime` has at least `last + 1` elements, and `x` is the element in `logtime` at index `last + 1`. If `delta`, the total seconds between `now` and `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `delta` is printed. Otherwise, the loop or the most internal if statement is exited.***
