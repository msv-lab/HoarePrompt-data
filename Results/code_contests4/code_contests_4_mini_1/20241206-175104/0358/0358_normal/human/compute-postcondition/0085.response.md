Postcondition: ***`hour`, `minute`, `second` are assigned values parsed from the substring of `line` between indices `a` and `b`, and `now` is a datetime object. `logtime` includes the value of `now`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `last` is less than the length of `logtime` and `x` is `logtime[last]`. If `delta`, calculated as the integer value of total seconds between `now` and `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `delta` is printed and `last` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `delta` is printed and, if `delta` is less than `n`, the loop breaks out based on the specified conditions.***
