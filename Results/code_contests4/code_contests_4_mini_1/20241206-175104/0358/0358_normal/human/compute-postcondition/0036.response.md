Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `logtime` is a list containing datetime objects, `last` is the number of datetime objects in `logtime` such that the difference between `now` and each datetime object is greater than or equal to `n`, and `delta` is the total seconds between `now` and the last datetime object checked before the loop exited. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `line[:b]` is printed.***
