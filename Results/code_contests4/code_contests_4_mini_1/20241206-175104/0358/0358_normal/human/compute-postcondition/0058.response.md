Postcondition: ***`now` is a datetime object, `last` is greater than or equal to 1, and `delta` is calculated as int((now - x).total_seconds()). If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `x` is the element in `logtime` at index `last - 1`, and `delta` is calculated as int((now - x).total_seconds()). Otherwise, `x` is the element in `logtime` at index `last`, `delta` is calculated as int((now - x).total_seconds()), and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
