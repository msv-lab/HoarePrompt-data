Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `logtime` is a list containing at least 2 datetime objects, `last` is 3, `x` is the third datetime object in the list, and `delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program continues execution. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
