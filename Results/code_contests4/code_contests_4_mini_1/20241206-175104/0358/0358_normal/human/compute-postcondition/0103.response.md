Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is a list containing datetime objects collected from the log; `last` is the count of datetime objects in `logtime` that are at least `n` seconds old; if the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the last processed log line up to index `b` is printed; if not, -1 is printed.**
