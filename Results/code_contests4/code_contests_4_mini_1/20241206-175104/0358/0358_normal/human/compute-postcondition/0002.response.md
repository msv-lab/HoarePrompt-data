The variable `logtime` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n` and `m` retain their previous values, which were assigned from the input. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers; `logtime` is an empty list**
