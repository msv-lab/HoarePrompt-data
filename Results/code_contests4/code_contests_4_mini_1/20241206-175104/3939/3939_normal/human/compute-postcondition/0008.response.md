The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the tuple `memo`. The current value of `memo` is (3, 6), so `x` will be assigned the value 3 and `y` will be assigned the value 6. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 6.

Output State: **`memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 6**.
