According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4, since `i` (which will be 2) must be less than `n - 2`.

State: **`memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 21**
