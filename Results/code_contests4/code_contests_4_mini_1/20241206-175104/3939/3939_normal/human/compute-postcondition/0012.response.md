`x` is assigned the first element of `memo`, which is 6, and `y` is assigned the second element of `memo`, which is 21. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `value` are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 21.

Output State: **`memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 21**
