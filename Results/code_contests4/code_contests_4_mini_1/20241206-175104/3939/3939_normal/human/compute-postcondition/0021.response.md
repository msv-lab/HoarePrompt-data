The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with a positive integer `n` that is constrained to the range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the given constraints, we can summarize the functionality of the function as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It operates based on a positive integer n constrained to 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7, but the specific output is not provided.**
