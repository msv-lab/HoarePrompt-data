`x` is assigned the value of the first element of `memo`, which is `0`, and `y` is assigned the value of the second element of `memo`, which is `3`. The other variables `MOD`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 3.

Output State: **`memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 3**
