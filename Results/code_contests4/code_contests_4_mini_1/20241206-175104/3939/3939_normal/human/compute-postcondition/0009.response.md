`value` is assigned the value of `2 * y + 3 * x`. The values of `y` and `x` are 6 and 3, respectively. Therefore, the calculation is `2 * 6 + 3 * 3`, which results in `12 + 9 = 21`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 21**
