`memo` is assigned the value of `y`, which is 6, and `value % MOD`, where `value` is 21 and `MOD` is 1000000007. The calculation for `value % MOD` results in 21 since 21 is less than 1000000007. Thus, `memo` becomes (6, 21). The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 21; after execution, `memo` is (6, 21).

Output State: **`memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 21**
