`memo` is assigned the value `(y, value % MOD)`. The previous value of `y` is 3, and `value` is 6. The calculation for `value % MOD` is `6 % 1000000007`, which equals 6 since 6 is less than 1000000007. Therefore, after execution, `memo` will be `(3, 6)`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`memo` is (3, 6), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 3, `value` is 6**
