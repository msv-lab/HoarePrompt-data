To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's operation. The loop iterates `n - 2` times, meaning if `n` is equal to 2, the loop will not execute. For higher values of `n`, the loop will execute multiple times.

In each iteration of the loop:
- The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values from `memo`.
- The variable `value` is calculated using the formula `2 * y + 3 * x`.
- The `memo` is then updated to be `(y, value % MOD)`.

From the examples provided, we can see how the values change:
1. After the first iteration, `memo` becomes (3, 6).
2. After the second iteration, `memo` becomes (6, 21).
3. After the third iteration, `memo` becomes (21, 60).

Continuing this pattern, we can see that the first element of `memo` grows based on the previous values, and the second element increases as well, following the defined mathematical operations.

To summarize the end state after all iterations:
- If `n` is 2, `memo` remains (0, 3) since the loop does not execute.
- If `n` is 3, `memo` becomes (3, 6) after one iteration.
- If `n` is 4, after two iterations, it becomes (6, 21).
- For `n` greater than 4, we continue the pattern until `n-2` iterations are executed.

Thus, the output state, after considering all cases and the pattern of how `memo` evolves, can be summarized as:

Output State: **`memo` is the result after `n - 2` iterations, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.**
