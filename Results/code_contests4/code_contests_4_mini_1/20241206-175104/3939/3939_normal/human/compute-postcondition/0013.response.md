`value` is assigned the result of the expression `2 * y + 3 * x`. Given that `y` is 21 and `x` is 6, we calculate:

`value = 2 * 21 + 3 * 6 = 42 + 18 = 60`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, and `value` is 60.

Output State: **`memo` is (6, 21), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60**.
