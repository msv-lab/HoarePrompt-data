The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts input from the user. However, since `n` is defined to be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^7, the type of `n` will change from being an integer to a string after this assignment. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is that `n` is now a string representation of the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the user input**
