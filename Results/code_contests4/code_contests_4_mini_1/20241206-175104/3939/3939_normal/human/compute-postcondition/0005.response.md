To evaluate the code snippet given the initial state:

1. The variable `y` has a value of 3.
2. The variable `x` has a value of 0.
3. The calculation `value = 2 * y + 3 * x` is performed.

Now substituting the values:
- `2 * y` becomes `2 * 3 = 6`
- `3 * x` becomes `3 * 0 = 0`

Thus, `value` is calculated as:
- `value = 6 + 0 = 6`

No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`memo` is (0, 3), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 3, `value` is 6**
