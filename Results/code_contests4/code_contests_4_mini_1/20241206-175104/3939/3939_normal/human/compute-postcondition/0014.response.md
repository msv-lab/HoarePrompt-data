The variable `memo` is assigned the values `y` and `value % MOD`. The previous value of `y` is 21 and `value` is 60. The calculation for `value % MOD` is `60 % 1000000007`, which is 60 since 60 is less than `MOD`. Therefore, `memo` will be updated to (21, 60). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`memo` is (21, 60), `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `x` is 6, `y` is 21, `value` is 60**
