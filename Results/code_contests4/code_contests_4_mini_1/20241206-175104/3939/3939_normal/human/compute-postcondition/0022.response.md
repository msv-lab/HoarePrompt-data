Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input, which must be in the range of 1 to 10^7. If `n` is equal to 1, it prints 0. If `n` is equal to 2, it prints 3. For values of `n` greater than 2, it performs a calculation using a loop that executes `n - 2` times and prints the second value of the `memo` tuple after the loop, which is derived from a specific recurrence relation. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results based on the value of `n`.**
