The expression `0 if n == 1 else 3` evaluates the value of `n`. Since `n` is equal to 2, the condition `n == 1` is false. Therefore, the expression evaluates to 3. The `print` function outputs this value, but does not affect the state of other variables. 

The output state is: `memo` is the result after `n - 2` iterations, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is 2, and the printed value is 3.

Output State: **`memo` is the result after `n - 2` iterations, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is 2, and the printed value is 3.**
