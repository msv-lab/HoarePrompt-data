Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a couple of critical flaws that prevent it from functioning correctly according to the problem description.

1. **Indexing Errors**: The program uses zero-based indexing for the string `S` while the problem description specifies that the indices for the queries are one-based. This discrepancy means that when handling queries, the program could potentially access out-of-bounds elements or incorrect characters in the string.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Type 1 Queries**: The program attempts to change a character in the string by directly modifying the `s` list. However, the logic for updating the relevant segment tree is faulty. Specifically, the program sets the value at the index of the old character to `0` and the new character to `1`, but it does not correctly manage the case when the character is already the same (it should do nothing).

3. **Type 2 Query Logic**: The logic for counting distinct characters within the specified range is not correctly implemented. The program checks if the result from `func_3(l, r + 1)` is not zero for each character from 'a' to 'z'. However, it does not actually check the correct intervals for distinct counts.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
5
abcde
1
2 1 5
```
Expected Output:
```
5
```
However, due to the flaws in the implementation, the program could fail to return the correct number of distinct characters in the specified range. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
