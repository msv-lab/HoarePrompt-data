#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the length of string S, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and each query is either of type 1 or type 2, where type 1 consists of an integer i_q (1 <= i_q <= N) and a lowercase letter c_q, and type 2 consists of integers l_q and r_q (1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N).
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `N`, and `tree[ddd][N]` to `tree[ddd][2N - 1]` are assigned the values `arr[0]` to `arr[N - 1]` respectively.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer, `n` is equal to `N`, `tree[ddd][i]` for `i` from `1` to `N-1` is the sum of `tree[ddd][2*i]` and `tree[ddd][2*i + 1]` for each respective `i`, and `tree[ddd][N]` remains as initially defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an array `arr` that is used to initialize a segment tree. It populates the segment tree with the elements of `arr` and computes the sums for internal nodes based on the values of its children. However, the function does not process any queries as described in the annotations, meaning it does not handle query types 1 or 2, which are mentioned but not implemented in the code. Therefore, the actual functionality is limited to building the segment tree from the input array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers such that 1 <= i_q <= N and 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N, and c_q is a lowercase English letter.
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, `p` is increased by `n`, and `tree[ddd][1]` is updated to `tree[ddd][2] + tree[ddd][3]`, where the values of `tree[ddd][2]` and `tree[ddd][3]` depend on their initial values before the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `p`, modifies it by adding an integer `n` to it, and updates a segment tree data structure (represented by `tree[ddd]`) based on the provided `value`. The function processes updates to the segment tree but does not return any results or handle specific query conditions as suggested by the annotations. Therefore, it only updates the segment tree without handling any queries or returning any output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, and Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000. The indices i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers such that 1 <= i_q <= N and 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N. c_q is a lowercase English letter.
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to the final value after all iterations of right-shifting (i.e., the original value of `r` divided by 2 raised to the number of iterations), and `res` includes contributions from the indices accessed during the iterations of the loop. `r` must be greater than or equal to `l` at the end of the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns the accumulated contributions stored in 'res' from the indices accessed during the iterations of the loop, where 'r' is the final value after the right-shifting and is greater than or equal to 'l'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`, and returns the accumulated contributions from a data structure (likely a segment tree) based on the indices accessed during iterations. It processes contributions from these indices while adjusting `l` and `r` through bitwise operations, ensuring that `l` is less than `r` throughout the loop. The function does not handle cases where `l` is initially greater than or equal to `r`, which may lead to unexpected results. Additionally, there are no checks for valid ranges for `l` and `r` based on the context provided.
