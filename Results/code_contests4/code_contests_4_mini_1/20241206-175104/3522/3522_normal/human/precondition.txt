N is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 500000), S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, Q is a positive integer (1 ≤ Q ≤ 20000), and each query consists of either a type 1 operation with i_q (1 ≤ i_q ≤ N) and c_q (a lowercase English letter) or a type 2 operation with l_q and r_q (1 ≤ l_q ≤ r_q ≤ N). There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.
