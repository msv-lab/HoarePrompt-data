The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `r` was halved, but its exact value is unknown. The other variables `l` and `res` remain unchanged, and the conditions for the loop continue to be evaluated. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is right-shifted by 1, and `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is decreased by 1, `l` is right-shifted by 1, and `res` remains unchanged.**
