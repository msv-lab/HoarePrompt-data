The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are integers, where `l` represents the starting index and `r` represents the final index after some operations. The output of the function is the accumulated contributions stored in 'res' from the indices accessed during iterations of the loop, with the condition that `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_3 is to accept two integers `l` and `r`, and return the accumulated contributions from the indices accessed during the loop iterations, given that `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, and returns the accumulated contributions from indices accessed during iterations, where `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.**
