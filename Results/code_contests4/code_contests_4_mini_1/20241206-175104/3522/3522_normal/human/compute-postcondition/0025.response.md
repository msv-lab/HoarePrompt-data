The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `l` is unknown, but it is currently right-shifted by 1. The other variables (`r` and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is right-shifted by 1; `l` is increased by 1; `res` is increased by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`.

Output State: **`r` is right-shifted by 1; `l` is increased by 1; `res` is increased by the value of `tree[ddd][l]**
