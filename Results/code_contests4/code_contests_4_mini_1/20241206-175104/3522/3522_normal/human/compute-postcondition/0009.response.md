The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Since `r` is an odd integer, after the execution, `r` will become an even integer. The values of the other variables (`l`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now an even integer, `l` is an odd integer, `n` is unchanged, and `res` is unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is now an even integer, `l` is an odd integer, `n` is unchanged, and `res` is unchanged.**
