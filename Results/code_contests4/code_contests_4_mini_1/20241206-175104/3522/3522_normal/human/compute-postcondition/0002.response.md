The value of `r` is increased by `n`, but the previous value of `r` is unknown, and `l` remains affected only by its previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `l` is increased by `n`; variable `r` is increased by `n` but its previous value is unknown. 

Output State: **variable `l` is increased by `n`; variable `r` is increased by `n` but its previous value is unknown.**
