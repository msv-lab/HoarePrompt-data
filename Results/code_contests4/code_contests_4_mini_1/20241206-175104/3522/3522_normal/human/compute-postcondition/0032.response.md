Output State: **`l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to the final value after all iterations of right-shifting (i.e., the original value of `r` divided by 2 raised to the number of iterations), and `res` includes contributions from the indices accessed during the iterations of the loop. `r` must be greater than or equal to `l` at the end of the loop.**
