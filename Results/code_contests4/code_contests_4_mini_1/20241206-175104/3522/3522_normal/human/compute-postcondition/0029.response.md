Postcondition: ***`r` is right-shifted by 1 and is greater than `l`. If `r` is odd, then `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is right-shifted by 1, and if `l` is odd, it is increased by 1 while `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][l]`. Additionally, `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][r]`. If `l` is even, it remains unchanged and `res` is updated accordingly.***
