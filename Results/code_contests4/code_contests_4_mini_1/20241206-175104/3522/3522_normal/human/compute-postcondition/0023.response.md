According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` has been right-shifted by 1, and `l` has also been right-shifted by 1. Since both `l` and `r` are right-shifted by 1, for the loop to execute again, `l` must still be less than `r`. This means that `r` must be greater than `l` after the right shifts. 

Assuming the initial values of `l` and `r` were such that `l < r` before shifting, we need to ensure that after right shifting, this condition still holds. Thus, if we denote the original values before shifting as `l'` and `r'`, we need `l'` (original `l`) to be less than `r'` (original `r`) and after shifts, we can say:

- `l' >> 1 < r' >> 1` must hold true.

This means that for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure `l` (after shift) is still less than `r` (after shift). 

State: **`r` is right-shifted by 1; `l` is right-shifted by 1; for the loop to execute again, `r` must be greater than `l` after shifting**.
