The value of `r` is updated by performing a right shift operation (`>>= 1`), which effectively divides `r` by 2 and takes the floor of that division. The conditions state that `r` must be greater than `l + n`, and although `l` is updated to `l >> 1`, the value of `res` remains unchanged. The output state reflects the changes to `r` and `l`, while noting the condition on `r`.

Output State: **`r` is now `r / 2` (floor division), `l` is updated to `l >> 1`, `res` remains unchanged, and `r` must be greater than `l + n**.
