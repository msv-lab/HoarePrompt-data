The value of `r` is right-shifted by 1, which means it is divided by 2 and the result is assigned back to `r`. The initial state indicates that `r` is greater than `l`, and since no specific values are provided for `r` and `l`, the output state will reflect the change to `r` while noting that it remains greater than `l`. The value of `l` is unaffected in this operation.

Output State: **`r` is right-shifted by 1 and remains greater than `l`; `l` is now right-shifted by 1.**
