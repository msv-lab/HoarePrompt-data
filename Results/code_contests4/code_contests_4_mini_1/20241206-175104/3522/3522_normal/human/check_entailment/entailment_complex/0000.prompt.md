You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process Q queries of the following two types:

* Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
* Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

* N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
* S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* c_q is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 \leq N \leq 500000
* 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
* |S| = N
* 1 \leq i_q \leq N
* 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
* There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q


Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:


1 i_q c_q



2 l_q r_q


Output

For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the length of string S, S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and each query is either of type 1 or type 2, where type 1 consists of an integer i_q (1 <= i_q <= N) and a lowercase letter c_q, and type 2 consists of integers l_q and r_q (1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N).
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `N`, and `tree[ddd][N]` to `tree[ddd][2N - 1]` are assigned the values `arr[0]` to `arr[N - 1]` respectively.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer, `n` is equal to `N`, `tree[ddd][i]` for `i` from `1` to `N-1` is the sum of `tree[ddd][2*i]` and `tree[ddd][2*i + 1]` for each respective `i`, and `tree[ddd][N]` remains as initially defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an array `arr` that is used to initialize a segment tree. It populates the segment tree with the elements of `arr` and computes the sums for internal nodes based on the values of its children. However, the function does not process any queries as described in the annotations, meaning it does not handle query types 1 or 2, which are mentioned but not implemented in the code. Therefore, the actual functionality is limited to building the segment tree from the input array.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers such that 1 <= i_q <= N and 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N, and c_q is a lowercase English letter.
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, `p` is increased by `n`, and `tree[ddd][1]` is updated to `tree[ddd][2] + tree[ddd][3]`, where the values of `tree[ddd][2]` and `tree[ddd][3]` depend on their initial values before the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `p`, modifies it by adding an integer `n` to it, and updates a segment tree data structure (represented by `tree[ddd]`) based on the provided `value`. The function processes updates to the segment tree but does not return any results or handle specific query conditions as suggested by the annotations. Therefore, it only updates the segment tree without handling any queries or returning any output.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 500000, and Q is an integer such that 1 <= Q <= 20000. The indices i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers such that 1 <= i_q <= N and 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N. c_q is a lowercase English letter.
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to the final value after all iterations of right-shifting (i.e., the original value of `r` divided by 2 raised to the number of iterations), and `res` includes contributions from the indices accessed during the iterations of the loop. `r` must be greater than or equal to `l` at the end of the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns the accumulated contributions stored in 'res' from the indices accessed during the iterations of the loop, where 'r' is the final value after the right-shifting and is greater than or equal to 'l'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`, and returns the accumulated contributions from a data structure (likely a segment tree) based on the indices accessed during iterations. It processes contributions from these indices while adjusting `l` and `r` through bitwise operations, ensuring that `l` is less than `r` throughout the loop. The function does not handle cases where `l` is initially greater than or equal to `r`, which may lead to unexpected results. Additionally, there are no checks for valid ranges for `l` and `r` based on the context provided.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
