The code performs a bitwise XOR operation between the element at index `i` of the array `a` and the element at index `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2, it will specifically compute `a[2] ^= a[1]`. The exact values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` are not provided, but the operation will affect `a[2]` directly while leaving other variables unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `a[2]` is updated to the result of `a[2] XOR a[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `a[2]` is updated to the result of `a[2] XOR a[1]**
