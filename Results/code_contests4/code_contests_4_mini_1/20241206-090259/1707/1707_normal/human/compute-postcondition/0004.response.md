In this case, `a[i]` is being modified using the XOR operator with the value of `a[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is 1, so we will be accessing `a[1]` and `a[0]`. The initial values of `a[1]` and `a[0]` are not provided, but the operation will update `a[1]`.

The operation is:
```
a[1] = a[1] ^ a[0]
```

Since `a[1]` is being modified based on its current value and the value of `a[0]`, we cannot determine the exact values without knowing what `a[0]` and `a[1]` are.

Thus, the output state reflects the fact that `a[1]` is updated based on the XOR operation with `a[0]`, but the specific values are not known. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `a[1]` is updated as `a[1] ^= a[0]`**
