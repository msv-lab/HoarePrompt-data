According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is now equal to `i`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`. Since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `i - 1`, the next value of `j` would be `1` (if `i > 1`). Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 2 for the loop to run again.

State: **`ans` is updated to max(ans, a[i] ^ a[j]), where `j` is now `1`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 1.**
