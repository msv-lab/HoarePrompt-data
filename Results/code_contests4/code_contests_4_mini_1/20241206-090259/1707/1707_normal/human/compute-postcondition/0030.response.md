According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the variable `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 2`, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` starts at 0, to execute the loop one more time, `j` will be incremented to 1. 

Now, for the loop to execute again, `i` (which is `n + 2`) must remain greater than the new value of `j` (which will be 1). 

State: **`ans` is the maximum value obtained from the XOR operations between `a[n + 1]` and all previous `a[j]` for `0 ≤ j ≤ n`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 1.**
