The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the provided definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and there is an array consisting of `n` non-negative integers, each strictly less than 2^30. 

Given the constraints and the expected behavior, the function will return a result based on the values present in the array. The specific output is not provided, so we cannot detail the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle a scenario based on the constraints of `n` and the array of integers.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an array consisting of n non-negative integers (each < 2^30), returning a result based on these inputs.**
