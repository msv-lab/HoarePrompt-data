According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Currently, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` should be incremented to 2. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `i` is increased by 1, `i` will be 2 after this increment. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
