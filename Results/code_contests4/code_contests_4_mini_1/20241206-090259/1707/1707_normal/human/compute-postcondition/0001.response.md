The value of `s` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means it takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
