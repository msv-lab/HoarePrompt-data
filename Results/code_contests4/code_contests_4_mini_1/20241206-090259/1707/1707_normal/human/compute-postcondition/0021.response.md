The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the result of `a[i] ^ a[j]`. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, which implies we're accessing the cumulative XOR value at that index, and `j` is 0, representing the starting point of the list `a`. The state of `a` is still the same, but `ans` will be recalculated.

Since `a[i]` is the cumulative XOR from `a[0]` to `a[n + 1]`, and `a[j]` (where `j` is 0) corresponds to `a[0]`, which is the first element of the list, the new value of `ans` will depend on the values of `a[n + 1]` and `a[0]`. However, the specific values of `a` and `ans` are not provided and cannot be determined.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `ans` without specific numeric values:

Output State: **`ans` is updated to max(ans, a[n + 1] ^ a[0])**
