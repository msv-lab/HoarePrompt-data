The variable `a[i]` is updated using the XOR operation with the value of `a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, this means `a[3]` is updated to the result of `a[3] XOR a[2]`. The previous values of `a[3]` and `a[2]` are not specified, but we know that `a[2]` has already been updated to the result of `a[2] XOR a[1]`. Therefore, `a[3]` will take on a new value based on its current value and the updated value of `a[2]`.

The output state remains uncertain regarding the specific values of `a[2]` and `a[3]`, but we can conclude that `a[3]` has been modified in relation to `a[2]`. Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is updated based on the XOR of its previous value and `a[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is updated based on the XOR of its previous value and `a[2]**
