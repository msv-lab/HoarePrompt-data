Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value obtained from the XOR operations between all `a[i]` and `a[j]` for `0 ≤ j < i` across all iterations of the loop, `a` is a list where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`) is the cumulative XOR of the elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.**
