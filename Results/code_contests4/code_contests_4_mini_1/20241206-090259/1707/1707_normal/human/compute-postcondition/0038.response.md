Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an array of `n` non-negative integers (each less than 2^30). It computes the cumulative XOR of the elements in the array, then calculates and prints the maximum XOR value obtained from any two cumulative XOR values in the array. The function does not handle cases where the input is not within the specified constraints, nor does it account for potential input errors, such as non-integer values. **
