Output State: **`a` is a list where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`) is the cumulative XOR of the elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]`; `n` is at least 1; `ans` is the maximum value between its current value and the result of `a[i] ^ a[j]`; for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is 0.**
