According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 2`, meaning the last value of `j` was `1`, and the loop has executed for `j = 0` and `j = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `2`. 

Since `i` is `n + 2`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`, which is true since `j` is currently `2` and `i` is `n + 2`. Therefore, `ans` may potentially be updated again if `j` is indeed less than `i`.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value obtained from the XOR operations, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be `n + 2`**
