According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates with `j` ranging from `0` to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is currently 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to be executed again, `j` should be 1, and it must also ensure that `i` remains at least 2 to allow for another valid iteration.

State: **`a` is a list where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`) is the cumulative XOR of the elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]`; `n` is at least 1; `ans` is the maximum value between its current value and the result of `a[i] ^ a[j]`; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 1 and `i` must be at least 2.**
