The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input from the user, splits it into a list based on whitespace, and assigns that list to `s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
