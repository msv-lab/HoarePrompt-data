The loop iterates from 1 to `n` and updates the list `a` such that each element `a[i]` is XORed with the previous element `a[i-1]`. After all iterations, the first element `a[0]` remains unchanged, while each subsequent element `a[i]` will contain the cumulative XOR of all previous elements up to `a[i]`.

If `n` is 1, `a[1]` will be `a[1] ^ a[0]`. If `n` is 2, `a[2]` will be `a[2] ^ a[1]` and so forth.

After the loop executes `n` times, the values in `a` will reflect the cumulative XOR up to each index from 1 to `n`. If the loop does not execute, `a` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[0]` through `a[i]` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`**
