The statement `a[i] ^= a[i - 1]` applies the bitwise XOR operation between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and assigns the result back to `a[i]`. The value of `i` is 3, which means the operation involves `a[3]` and `a[2]`. 

We do not have specific values for `a[3]` and `a[2]`, but we know that the operation will change the value of `a[3]` based on the current value of `a[2]`. The output state will reflect the previous values of `a[3]` and `a[2]` without changing the values of `n` or `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 3, and `a[3]` is updated based on the XOR with `a[2]`**
