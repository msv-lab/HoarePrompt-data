According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will iterate `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute once, with `j` being 0 during the first iteration. The state of `n` and `ans` does not directly influence the execution of the loop in this case, but we note that `ans` is initialized to 0.

Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` will take the value 0. Thus, the adjustment needed is to confirm the current state of `i` and `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
