Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and reads `n` non-negative integers (each strictly less than 2^30) from input. It computes the cumulative XOR of these integers and finds the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from any two distinct elements in this list, including the cumulative values and the initial zero. The result is printed as output. **
