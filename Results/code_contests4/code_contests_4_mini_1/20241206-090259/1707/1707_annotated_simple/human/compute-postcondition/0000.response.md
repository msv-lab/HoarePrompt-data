`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and it is now assigned the value from `raw_input()`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and it is now assigned the value from `raw_input()`**.
