The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained by the condition that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The function also processes a second line containing `n` non-negative integers, each strictly less than \(2^{30}\). After executing the function body, it performs operations based on these inputs. 

Since the output behavior is not specified, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and processes `n` non-negative integers each strictly less than 2^30.**
