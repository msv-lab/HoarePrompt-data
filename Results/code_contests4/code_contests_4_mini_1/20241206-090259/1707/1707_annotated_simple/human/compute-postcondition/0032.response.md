According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relationship with `i`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `i` is also 3. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 4, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 4.

State: **`ans` is updated to max(previous ans, a[3] ^ a[3]), `i` is 3, `j` is 4; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 4.**
