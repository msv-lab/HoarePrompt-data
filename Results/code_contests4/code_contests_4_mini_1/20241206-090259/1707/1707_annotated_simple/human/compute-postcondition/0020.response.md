According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `i`, which is currently set to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` must start from 0 and go up to 1 (the values will be 0 and 1 for the two iterations). 

Since `j` is currently 0 and will be incremented within the loop, the loop will execute a second time if `j` is allowed to reach 1. Additionally, the condition states that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time. 

Thus, the required states are:
- `ans` remains equal to `max(0, a[1] ^ a[0])`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is currently 0, which will increment to 1 during the first iteration, allowing the loop to execute a second time.
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`ans` is equal to max(0, a[1] ^ a[0]), `i` is 2, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
