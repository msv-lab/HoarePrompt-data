According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop continues executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2. 

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`ans` is equal to max(0, a[1] ^ a[0]), `i` is 2, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
