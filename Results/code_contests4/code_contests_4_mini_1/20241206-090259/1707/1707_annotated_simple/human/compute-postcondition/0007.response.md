According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit provided by `n`. The loop is set to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be at least 3. Additionally, since `i` increases by 1 after each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time.**
