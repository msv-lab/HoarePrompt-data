According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `i` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1, making it 3, and since `i` is 3, the loop can execute again only if `j` is less than `i`.

State: **`ans` is updated to max(previous ans, a[3] ^ a[2]), `i` is 3, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 3**
