According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
