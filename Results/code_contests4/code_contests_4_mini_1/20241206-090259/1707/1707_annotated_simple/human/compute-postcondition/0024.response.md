According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop will run as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 2, and `i` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`ans` is updated to max(`ans`, `a[2]` ^ `a[1]`); `i` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a fourth time `n` must be greater than 2.**
