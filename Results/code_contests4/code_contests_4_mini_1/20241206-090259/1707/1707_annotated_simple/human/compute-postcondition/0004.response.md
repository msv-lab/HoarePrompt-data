In the given code, `a[i]` is assigned the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]` and `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]`. The values of `a[1]` and `a[0]` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, we can state that `a[1]` will now be updated based on the values of `a[1]` and `a[0]` using XOR.

Therefore, after executing the code, the values of the other variables remain unchanged, and we note that `a[1]` has changed based on the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `a[1]` has been updated to `a[1] ^ a[0]`.**
