To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the statement on the variables involved.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is equal to `max(ans, a[2] ^ a[0], a[2] ^ a[1], a[2] ^ a[2])`
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is 2

2. **Execution**:
   - The code `ans = max(ans, a[i] ^ a[j])` calculates the value of `a[i] ^ a[j]` where:
     - `i` is 3, so `a[i]` refers to `a[3]`
     - `j` is 2, so `a[j]` refers to `a[2]`
   - `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `a[3] ^ a[2]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The exact numeric values of `a[2]` and `a[3]` are not provided, so we denote them as `a[2]` and `a[3]` respectively.
   - The previous value of `ans` remains unknown, but it is impacted by the new calculation involving `a[3] ^ a[2]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated condition of `ans`, considering it has been recalculated based on the provided variables.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to max(previous ans, a[3] ^ a[2]), `i` is 3, `j` is 2**
