The operation `a[i] ^= a[i - 1]` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the elements of the array `a` at the indices `i` and `i - 1`. The variable `i` is currently 3, meaning `a[3]` is being modified based on the value of `a[2]`. Since `n` is between 1 and 100 and is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, we can conclude that the array `a` has at least 4 elements (indices 0 to 3). 

The previous values of `a[3]` and `a[2]` are unknown, but after executing this code, `a[3]` will hold the result of the bitwise XOR between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 3, `a[3]` is now a[3] XOR a[2]**
