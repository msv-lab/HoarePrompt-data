The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Additionally, it accepts an array consisting of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). The function processes these inputs and produces a result based on the defined logic. However, since the specific output based on the input parameters has not been provided, we cannot determine the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and an array of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and return a result based on the processing of these inputs.
