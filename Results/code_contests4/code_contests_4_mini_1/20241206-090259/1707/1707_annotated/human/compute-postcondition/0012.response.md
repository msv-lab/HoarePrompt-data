According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `i - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute once, as `j` will take the value of 0 during the first iteration. The current state of `n`, `a`, and `ans` does not affect the execution of the loop in this case, because the loop will run with the given value of `i`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` will be 0. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `a[i]` is the XOR of all previous elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
