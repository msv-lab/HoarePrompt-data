The code `a[i] ^= a[i - 1]` applies the XOR operation between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is currently 1, so this operation will affect the elements `a[1]` and `a[0]`. 

Since `n` is between 1 and 100, the size of the array `a` must be at least 2 to accommodate the indices 0 and 1. The specific values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not provided, so we denote them as `a[1]` and `a[0]` respectively. 

After executing the operation, `a[1]` will hold the result of `a[1] XOR a[0]`. The state of `a[0]` remains unchanged, while `a[1]` is updated.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a[1]` is modified based on the XOR operation with `a[0]`. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is modified to `a[1] XOR a[0]`, `a[0]` remains unchanged.**
