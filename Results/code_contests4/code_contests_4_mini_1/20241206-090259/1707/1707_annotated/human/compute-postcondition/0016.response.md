According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The loop is set up to iterate through values of `j` in the range from 0 to `i - 1`. Since `i` is 1, the range for `j` will be from 0 to 0, meaning there is only one valid value for `j`, which is 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and the range for `j` will then be from 0 to 1, allowing the loop to execute with valid values for `j`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `a[i]` is the XOR of all previous elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`; `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and the result of `a[i] ^ a[j]`; `i` is 2; `j` is 0 for the loop to execute a second time with valid values for `j`.**
