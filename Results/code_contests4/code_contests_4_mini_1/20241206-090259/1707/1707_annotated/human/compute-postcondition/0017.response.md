The variable `ans` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and the result of `a[i] ^ a[j]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, we need the values of `a[2]` and `a[0]` to compute `a[i] ^ a[j]`. The variable `a[i]` is the XOR of all previous elements from `a[0]` to `a[2]`, and `a[j]` is `a[0]`.

Since `n` is between 1 and 100, and `a[i]` is defined as the XOR of all previous elements in `a`, we can assume that `a[0]` is the first element, and `a[1]` is the XOR of `a[0]` and the second element, and so on. However, we do not have specific values for `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, but we know the operation will take place.

The output state will reflect that `ans` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and the computed XOR.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `a[2] ^ a[0]`**
