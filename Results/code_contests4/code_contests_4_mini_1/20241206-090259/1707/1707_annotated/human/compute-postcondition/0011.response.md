According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop is defined to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute if `n` is at least `1`. Given that `n` is already stated to be between `1` and `100`, the loop will execute correctly. 

At the start of the loop, the index `i` will be initialized to `1` for the first iteration. The variable `ans` is `0`, which does not affect the execution of the loop, but it indicates that `ans` is ready to be used in the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we just need to ensure that `i` is `1`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `a[i]` is the XOR of all previous elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 1**
