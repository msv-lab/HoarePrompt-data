According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (because `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration). Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
