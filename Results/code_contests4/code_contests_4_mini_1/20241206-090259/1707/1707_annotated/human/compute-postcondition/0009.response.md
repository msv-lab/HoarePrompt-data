The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and during each iteration, it updates the `i`-th element of the list `a` using a bitwise XOR operation with the previous element (`a[i - 1]`). This operation modifies each `a[i]` based on the cumulative XOR of all previous values in `a` up to that point. After all iterations of the loop, `a[i]` will contain the XOR of all previous elements up to `a[i]`.

If `n` is between 1 and 100, the loop will execute `n` times, updating all elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]`. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `a[i]` is the XOR of all previous elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for `i` in range 1 to `n`.**
