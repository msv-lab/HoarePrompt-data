According to the code, the loop will execute when `n` is at least 1, which is guaranteed by the problem statement that `n` is a new input integer between 1 and 100. The loop uses `i` which starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. 

Before the loop starts, `s` is a list of strings and `a` is a list that begins with 0 followed by the integer conversions of the elements in `s`. However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` has a defined starting value.

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be initialized to 1 as specified in the loop statement. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted or noted are:

- `n` must be between 1 and 100, which it is, so it can remain as is.
- `i` must start at 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
