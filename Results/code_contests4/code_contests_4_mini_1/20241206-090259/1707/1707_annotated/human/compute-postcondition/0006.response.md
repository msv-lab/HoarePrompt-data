The code `a[i] ^= a[i - 1]` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the element at index `i` of the array `a` and the element at index `i - 1`. The state of `i` is 2, so the operation will involve `a[2]` and `a[1]`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100, implying that the array `a` must have at least 3 elements (index 0, 1, 2) for the operation to be valid.

Since the previous values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact outcome of the XOR operation. However, we note that the values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` will be changed based on the XOR operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100; `i` is 2; and `a[2]` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR with `a[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100; `i` is 2; `a[2]` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR with `a[1]**
