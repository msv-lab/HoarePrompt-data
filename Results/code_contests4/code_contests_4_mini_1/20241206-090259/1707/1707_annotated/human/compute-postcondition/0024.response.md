According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is between 2 and 101. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is between 2 and 101, `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than 2.**
