According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and given that `n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` will be incremented). After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
