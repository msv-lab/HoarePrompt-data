According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined for `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means `j` has taken values from 0 to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

However, since `j` is now equal to `i`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 3, which allows `j` to take the value of 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be in the range from 0 to 2.**
