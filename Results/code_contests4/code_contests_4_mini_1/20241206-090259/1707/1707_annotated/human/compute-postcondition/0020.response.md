According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0 since `j` will iterate from 0 to `i - 1`. Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will execute because `n` is between 1 and 100, which means `i` is at least 2. 

However, we also need to clarify the state of `j` at the beginning of the loop. Since `j` starts from 0, it will be 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute properly, the conditions are:
- `n` is between 1 and 100 (which is already satisfied).
- `i` is `n + 1` (which is also satisfied).
- `j` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is n + 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
