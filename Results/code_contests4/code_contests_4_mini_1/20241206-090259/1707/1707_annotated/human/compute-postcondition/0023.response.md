The expression `ans = max(ans, a[i] ^ a[j])` assigns the maximum value between `ans` and the result of the bitwise XOR operation `a[i] ^ a[j]` to `ans`. The variables `i` and `j` are previously defined with `i` being `n + 1` and `j` being `1`. The value of `n` is between `1` and `100`, which means `i` will be between `2` and `101`.

The values of `a[i]` and `a[j]` depend on the specific contents of the array `a`, which are not provided, thus we cannot determine exact values for `a[i]` and `a[j]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is updated based on the maximum value of `ans` and the result of the XOR operation, but we cannot specify the exact value of `ans` or the XOR operation result without knowing the values in the array `a`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is between 2 and 101, `j` is 1; `ans` is updated to the maximum value between `ans` and `a[i] ^ a[j]`.**
