According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i - 1`. Since `i` is currently `1`, the range for `j` is `0`. Therefore, the loop has executed once for `j = 0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `2`, which allows the loop to iterate over the range from `0` to `1`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum XOR value from the pairs of `a[i]` and `a[j]` for all `j` in range from 0 to `n`, `a[i]` is the XOR of all previous elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be in the range from 0 to 1.**
