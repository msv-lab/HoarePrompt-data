The value of `n` is reassigned to the result of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since `n` was previously an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), it will now take on the new integer value from the input. The state of the array is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a new input integer between 1 and 100, and the array remains consisting of n non-negative integers, each less than 2^30.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer between 1 and 100; the array consists of `n` non-negative integers, each less than 2^30**
