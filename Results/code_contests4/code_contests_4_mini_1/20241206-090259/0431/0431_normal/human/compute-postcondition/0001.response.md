The variable `a` is assigned a new value which is a list generated by taking input from the user, splitting it by spaces, and converting each split string into an integer. The values in `a` will depend on the input provided, but the list will have `n` elements as stated in the initial condition. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as well as any other variables not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input.**
