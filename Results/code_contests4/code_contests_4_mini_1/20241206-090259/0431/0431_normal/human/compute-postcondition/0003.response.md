The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on the given constraints where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000), and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000) representing the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day. 

The function's output is defined by the logic that processes these inputs. However, the specific return value based on the inputs is not provided in the constraints. Thus, we cannot detail the return value without additional information on the function's internal logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts `n`, `k`, and `a` as defined by the constraints, but the specific return value based on these inputs is not detailed in the provided information.**
