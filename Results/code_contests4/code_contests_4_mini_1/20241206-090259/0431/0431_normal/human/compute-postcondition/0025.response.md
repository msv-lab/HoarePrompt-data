The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. The parameter `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the units of garbage produced on each day, and the length of `a` is denoted as `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). The parameter `k` is a positive integer representing the bag's capacity (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). After executing the function body, the program returns the total number of bags required for all elements in `a`. If there is any leftover (`carry`) that is not equal to 0, the total number of bags is increased by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to calculate and return the total number of bags required based on the units of garbage produced, considering the bag's capacity and any leftover garbage.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` representing daily garbage production and a positive integer `k` representing bag capacity, returning the total number of bags required, increased by 1 if there is leftover garbage.**
