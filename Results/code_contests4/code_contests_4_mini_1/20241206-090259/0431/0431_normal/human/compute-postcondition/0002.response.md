The code executes a print statement that calls the function `func_1` twice: first with the list `a` and then with the reversed list `a[::-1]`, both using `k` as an argument. The `min` function then evaluates the two results returned from `func_1` to find the minimum value between them.

Since the values of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)` are not provided, we cannot ascertain their specific outputs. However, we can state that the output will be the minimum of these two function calls, with `a` being a list of integers input by the user and `k` being a positive integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; the minimum result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on user input; the minimum result of `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)` is printed.**
