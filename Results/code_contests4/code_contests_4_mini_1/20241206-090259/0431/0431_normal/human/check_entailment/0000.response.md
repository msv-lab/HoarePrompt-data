To evaluate the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze both the code and the described behavior.

### Problem Description:
Vasya needs to dispose of garbage produced over `n` days using bags with a maximum capacity of `k`. The task is to compute the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all the garbage, ensuring no garbage remains after the last day. 

### Functions:
1. **Function 1 - `func_1(a, k)`**
   - This function calculates the total number of bags required to hold the garbage produced over `n` days while considering any leftover garbage from the previous day.
   - If there is leftover garbage after processing all days, it increases the bag count by one.

2. **Function 2 - `func_2()`**
   - This function reads input values for `k` and the list `a` of garbage units produced over `n` days.
   - It computes the minimum number of bags required by calling `func_1` on the list `a` and its reverse, and prints the minimum of those two values.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- The program needs to ensure that all garbage produced on any day is disposed of either that day or the next. The handling of leftover garbage from previous days is crucial.
- If `k` (the bag capacity) is larger than or equal to the total garbage produced on any given day, it should be handled correctly.
- If the production of garbage is zero (`0`), it should not result in unnecessary bags being counted.
- The edge case where multiple days result in garbage quantities that leave a remainder when divided by `k` must also be correctly handled, as this may lead to additional bags being required.

### Output Hints:
- The output hints state that the function returns the total number of bags needed and correctly accounts for leftover garbage.
- The second function prints the minimum number of bags required by considering both the original and reversed list of daily garbage production.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the implementation and the hints, it appears that:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the accumulation of garbage and the fact that leftover garbage affects the total count of bags.
- The output hints accurately describe the behavior of both functions in the context of the problem.

Given the thoroughness of the checks and the adherence to the problem's requirements, the program correctly implements the functionality as described.

Correctness: **True**.
