The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, representing daily garbage production, and a positive integer `k`, representing the bag's capacity. It calculates the total number of bags required to hold the garbage, accounting for any leftover garbage from the previous day's processing. If there is any leftover garbage after processing all days, it increases the bag count by one. The function returns the total number of bags needed.
