#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the units of garbage produced on each day, where the length of a is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), and k is a positive integer representing the bag's capacity (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(a, k):
    bags, carry = 0, 0
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1
            i = max(0, i - carry)
        
        bags += i // k
        
        carry = i % k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bags` is the total number of bags required for all elements in `a`, `carry` is the remainder from the last element's division by `k` or 0 if no elements were processed.
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bags` is the total number of bags required for all elements in `a`. If `carry` is not equal to 0, then `bags` is increased by 1. If `carry` is equal to 0, `bags` remains unchanged.
    return bags
    #The program returns the total number of bags required for all elements in 'a', increased by 1 if 'carry' is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, representing daily garbage production, and a positive integer `k`, representing the bag's capacity. It calculates the total number of bags required to hold the garbage, accounting for any leftover garbage from the previous day's processing. If there is any leftover garbage after processing all days, it increases the bag count by one. The function returns the total number of bags needed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each a[i] (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000) represents the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day.
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `k` and a list `a` of non-negative integers representing garbage produced over `n` days. It computes the minimum output of the function `func_1` when applied to the list `a` and its reverse, and prints that minimum value. Note that the function does not explicitly return any value, it only prints the result. The specific behavior of `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so the overall effect of `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
