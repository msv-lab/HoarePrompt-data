The function accepts a positive integer `k` and a list `a` of non-negative integers representing garbage produced over `n` days. It computes the minimum output of the function `func_1` when applied to the list `a` and its reverse, and prints that minimum value. Note that the function does not explicitly return any value, it only prints the result. The specific behavior of `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so the overall effect of `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
