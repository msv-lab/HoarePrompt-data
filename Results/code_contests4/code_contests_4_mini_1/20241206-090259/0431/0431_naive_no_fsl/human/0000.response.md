To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic in the code against the requirements specified.

The program defines a function to compute the minimum number of garbage bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage produced over a number of days, considering that:
1. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or the next day.
2. Each bag can hold up to `k` units of garbage.
3. The program should ensure that no garbage is left after the last day.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `n` (number of days) and `k` (capacity of each bag) from the input.
   - It reads an array `a` that represents the units of garbage produced each day.

2. **Garbage Disposal Logic** (`func_1`):
   - The function initializes `bags` and `carry` to zero.
   - It iterates through each day's garbage (`i`):
     - If there is `carry` from the previous day, it accounts for this by incrementing `bags` and reducing `i` accordingly.
     - It calculates the number of bags required for the current day's garbage using integer division (`i // k`) and updates `carry` with the remainder (`i % k`).
   - Finally, if `carry` is non-zero after the loop, it adds one more bag.

3. **Reversal Logic**: 
   - The program calls `func_1` twice: once with the original order of days and once with the reversed order. It takes the minimum of the two results.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Garbage on Last Day**: 
   - If the last day has garbage that exceeds `k`, the program should ensure that this is handled correctly. 
   - However, since the logic considers both the current day's garbage and any carry from the previous day, this case is handled correctly.

2. **Single Day with Excess Garbage**:
   - If `n = 1` and `a[0] > k`, it should correctly return `(a[0] + k - 1) // k` as the number of bags needed.

3. **Zero Garbage Days**:
   - If all days have zero garbage, the program should return `0`, which it does since bags are only incremented when there is garbage.

4. **Maximum Limits**:
   - Testing large inputs, for instance, `n = 2 * 10^5` and `k = 10^9` with maximum garbage units, will still process efficiently due to the linear iteration.

### Testing with Examples

The examples provided in the problem description yield the correct results according to the code. Each condition specified is adhered to, and the program considers the reversal of the days to ensure that the minimum bags required are calculated.

### Conclusion

After thorough examination, I cannot find any input or edge cases where the program fails to comply with the requirements stated in the problem description. The logic appears to handle all specified scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
