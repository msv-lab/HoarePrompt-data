The function accepts input values for two integers `k` and a list of non-negative integers `a`, and it computes the minimum value returned by `func_1` called on `a` and the reversed list of `a`. However, since the function does not explicitly return any values or handle input directly as parameters, it relies on user input and prints the result instead of returning it. The behavior and return values of `func_1` are unknown, which may affect the overall functionality.
