The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, which represents the daily garbage production, and a positive integer `k`, which indicates the capacity of a bag. It calculates the total number of bags needed to carry the garbage over `n` days. The function accounts for any leftover garbage from the last day's production and adds one additional bag if there is any remainder after dividing the garbage amount by `k`. In the case where the last day's garbage is less than `k` but greater than zero, it still counts as an additional bag. The function returns the total number of bags used.
