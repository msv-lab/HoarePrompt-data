The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it operates on the constraints where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and each `a_i` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for `i` in the range of `n`. 

The output behavior is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot detail potential return values or cases without additional context. Without that, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on input values where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `a_i` are non-negative integers for `i` in the range of `n`. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
