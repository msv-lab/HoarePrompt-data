Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `k` is a new input integer; `a_i` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for i in range(n); `a` is a list of integers derived from input; `func_1(a, k)` and `func_1(a[::-1], k)` are computed and the minimum of those two results is printed.**
