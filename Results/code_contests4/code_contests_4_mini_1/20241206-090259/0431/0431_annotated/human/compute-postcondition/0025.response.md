The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. The parameter `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the number of units of garbage produced on each of the `n` days. The parameter `k` is a positive integer representing the bag's capacity. After executing the function body, the program returns the total number of bags used to carry the garbage over `n` days, which has been increased by 1 since carry is not equal to 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to calculate and return the total number of bags used to transport garbage based on the daily production of garbage and the bag's capacity.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` representing daily garbage production and a positive integer `k` representing the bag's capacity, returning the total number of bags used to carry the garbage, increased by 1 if there is any leftover garbage.**
