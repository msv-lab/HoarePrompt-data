The variable `k` is assigned a new value from the input, while `_` is ignored. The specific value of `k` will be determined by the input provided. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `a_i` are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State references the unchanged values and the new value assigned to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `k` is a new input integer; `a_i` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for i in range(n)**
