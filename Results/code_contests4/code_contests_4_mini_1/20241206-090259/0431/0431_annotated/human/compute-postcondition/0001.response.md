The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces. The previous state of the `a_i` values is unknown as they depend on the input provided, but they will be a list of non-negative integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `k` is a new input integer; `a_i` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for i in range(n); `a` is a list of integers derived from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `k` is a new input integer; `a_i` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for i in range(n); `a` is a list of integers derived from input.**
