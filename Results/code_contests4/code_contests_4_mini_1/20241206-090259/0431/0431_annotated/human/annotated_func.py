#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the number of units of garbage produced on each of the n days, and k is a positive integer representing the bag's capacity, with 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, k):
    bags, carry = 0, 0
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1
            i = max(0, i - carry)
        
        bags += i // k
        
        carry = i % k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bags` is the total number of bags used to carry the garbage over `n` days, `carry` is the remainder of the last day's garbage when divided by `k`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the garbage produced each day.
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bags` is the total number of bags used to carry the garbage over `n` days. If `carry` is not equal to 0, `bags` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bags` remains unchanged. `carry` is the remainder of the last day's garbage when divided by `k`, and `carry` is not equal to 0. `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the garbage produced each day.
    return bags
    #The program returns the total number of bags used to carry the garbage over n days, which has been increased by 1 since carry is not equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, which represents the daily garbage production, and a positive integer `k`, which indicates the capacity of a bag. It calculates the total number of bags needed to carry the garbage over `n` days. The function accounts for any leftover garbage from the last day's production and adds one additional bag if there is any remainder after dividing the garbage amount by `k`. In the case where the last day's garbage is less than `k` but greater than zero, it still counts as an additional bag. The function returns the total number of bags used.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and a_i are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for i in range(n).
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input values for two integers `k` and a list of non-negative integers `a`, and it computes the minimum value returned by `func_1` called on `a` and the reversed list of `a`. However, since the function does not explicitly return any values or handle input directly as parameters, it relies on user input and prints the result instead of returning it. The behavior and return values of `func_1` are unknown, which may affect the overall functionality.
