The function accepts two integers `k` and `n`, and a list of non-negative integers `a` representing daily values. It computes the minimum result of the function `func_1` applied to the list `a` and the reversed list `a[::-1]` with `k` as a parameter. The function does not return any value explicitly; it only prints the minimum result of the two function calls.
