The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. The parameter `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the number of garbage units produced each day, and `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum capacity of a bag. After executing the function body, it returns the total number of bags formed from all elements in `a`, accounting for any leftover items if `carry` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `k`, and return the total number of bags needed to carry the garbage units produced each day, considering any leftover units. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` representing daily garbage units and a positive integer `k` representing bag capacity, returning the total number of bags formed from the garbage units while accounting for leftovers.**
