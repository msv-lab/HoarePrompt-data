Postcondition: ***`bags` is the total number of bags formed from all elements in `a`, `carry` is the leftover items after processing all elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements used for calculation, and `k` is a positive integer that represents the capacity of each bag. If `carry` is not equal to 0, `bags` is increased by 1 to account for the leftover items.***
