Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a`, representing the number of garbage units produced each day, and a positive integer `k`, representing the maximum capacity of a bag. It calculates and returns the total number of bags needed to accommodate the garbage units, taking into account any leftover items from the last day's garbage after filling the bags. If there are any remaining garbage units that do not fit into a full bag, it adds one more bag to account for those leftovers. **
