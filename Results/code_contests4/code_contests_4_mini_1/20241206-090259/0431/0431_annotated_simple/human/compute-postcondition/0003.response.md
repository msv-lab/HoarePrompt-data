The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided function signature. However, it operates under certain constraints for variables `n`, `k`, and `a_i` which are implied to be defined elsewhere. The function is expected to return a value based on the logic that utilizes these variables. 

Given the constraints:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- `a_i` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each day \(i\) from \(1\) to \(n\).

The function likely performs calculations based on these values and returns a result. Without additional details about the output, we cannot specify the exact return value. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to operate based on the defined constraints for `n`, `k`, and `a_i`, returning a computed result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 to 200000), `k` is a positive integer (1 to 10^9), and `a_i` are non-negative integers (0 to 10^9) for each day from 1 to `n`, and returns a result based on these values.**
