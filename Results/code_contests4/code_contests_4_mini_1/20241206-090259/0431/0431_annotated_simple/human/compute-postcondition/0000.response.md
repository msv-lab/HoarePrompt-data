The variable `k` is assigned a value from the input. The input is split into parts, and the second part is converted to an integer and assigned to `k`. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is not directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` and the newly assigned value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `k` is assigned a positive integer from input.**
