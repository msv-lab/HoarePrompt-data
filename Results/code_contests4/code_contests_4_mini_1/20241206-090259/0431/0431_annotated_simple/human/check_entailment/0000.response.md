To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the annotated program step by step.

### Problem Summary:
The task is to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage produced over `n` days, given that each bag can hold up to `k` units of garbage. Garbage produced on a given day can either be disposed of the same day or the next day, and no garbage should be left after the last day.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, k)`**:
   - This function takes a list `a` representing the amount of garbage produced each day and an integer `k` representing the capacity of a bag.
   - It initializes `bags` (to count the bags used) and `carry` (to keep track of leftover garbage that could not fit in the last bag).
   - It iterates through each day's garbage:
     - If there is leftover garbage (`carry`), it attempts to fill a new bag with it, incrementing the bag count.
     - It calculates how many full bags can be formed from the current day's garbage (`i // k`) and updates the `carry` with the leftover garbage (`i % k`).
   - After processing all days, if there is any remaining garbage in `carry`, it adds one more bag to the total.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input values and calls `func_1` on the list of garbage produced in the order given (`a`) and in reverse (`a[::-1]`).
   - It prints the minimum number of bags required between the two calls.

### Potential Issues:
- The function `func_2()` attempts to handle garbage disposal by considering both the original order of days and the reverse order. However, disposing of garbage based on the reverse order doesn't respect the condition that garbage produced on day `i` must be disposed of on that day or the next. The problem description specifies that the disposal plan is sequential; thus, reversing the order can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a day has a high volume of garbage that cannot be fully accommodated with the next day's garbage, reversing would ignore that dependency.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic of considering both orders violates the sequential disposal requirement, leading to potentially incorrect outputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
