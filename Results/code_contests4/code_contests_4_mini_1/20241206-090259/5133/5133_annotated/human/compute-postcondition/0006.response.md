The value of `f` is assigned the maximum value from the list `ary`, which contains the values `[c, d, e]`. The values of `c`, `d`, and `e` are dependent on the input integers `a` and `b`. Specifically, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the difference of `a` and `b`, and `e` is the product of `a` and `b`. Thus, `ary` will contain the values `a + b`, `a - b`, and `a * b`.

Since `f` is assigned the maximum of these three values, it will be the largest value among `a + b`, `a - b`, and `a * b`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is `a + b`, `d` is `a - b`, `e` is `a * b`, `ary` is [c, d, e], and `f` is the maximum value of `ary`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is `a + b`, `d` is `a - b`, `e` is `a * b`, `ary` is [c, d, e], `f` is the maximum value of `ary`**.
