To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break it down:

1. **Initial Variables**: 
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `c` is defined as the sum of `a` and `b` (i.e., `c = a + b`).
   - `d` is defined as the result of `a - b` (i.e., `d = a - b`).
   - `e` is defined as the product of `a` and `b` (i.e., `e = a * b`).

2. **Execution of the Code**:
   - The line `ary = [c, d, e]` assigns a list to `ary` that contains the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The values of `c`, `d`, and `e` are calculated based on the input integers `a` and `b`.
   - The list `ary` will hold the computed values.

4. **Output State**:
   - The output will reflect the integers `a` and `b` as well as the calculated values for `c`, `d`, and `e`.

Assuming the inputs for `a` and `b` are taken into account, we represent the output state considering the calculations.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is `a + b`, `d` is `a - b`, `e` is `a * b`, `ary` is [c, d, e]**.
