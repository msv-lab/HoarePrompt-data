The function `func` accepts two parameters: `A` and `B`. Both `A` and `B` are integers constrained within the range of -1000 to 1000. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value based on the given information. However, it is implied that the function will perform some operations involving `A` and `B` based on their integer nature. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, A and B, both of which are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000.**
