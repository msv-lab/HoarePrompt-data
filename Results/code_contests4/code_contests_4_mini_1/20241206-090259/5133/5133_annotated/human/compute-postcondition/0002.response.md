`c` is assigned the value of `a + b`, where `a` and `b` are input integers. The values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged and are not directly affected by the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between the input integers and the newly calculated variable.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`**
