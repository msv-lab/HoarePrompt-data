The variable `e` is assigned the value of `a * b`. The values of `a` and `b` are input integers, and thus `e` will be the product of these two input values. The states of the other variables (`A`, `B`, `c`, and `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`; `d` is the result of `a - b`; `e` is the product of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`; `d` is the result of `a - b`; `e` is the product of `a` and `b**.
