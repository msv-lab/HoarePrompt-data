The value of `d` is assigned the result of `a - b`, where `a` and `b` are input integers. The values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `d` based on the inputs `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`; `d` is the result of `a - b`.**
