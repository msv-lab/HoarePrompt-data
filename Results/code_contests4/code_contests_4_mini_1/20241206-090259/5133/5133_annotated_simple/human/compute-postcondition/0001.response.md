The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `A` and `B` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer; `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer; `b` is an input integer**
