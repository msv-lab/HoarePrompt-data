The variable `ary` is assigned a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`. The values of `c`, `d`, and `e` are determined by the expressions `A + b`, `A - b`, and `A * b`, respectively. Since `A` and `b` are both integers, the values of `c`, `d`, and `e` will be calculated accordingly.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `A`, `B`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`, as well as the newly created list `ary`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`, `d` is equal to `A - b`, `e` is equal to `A * b, `ary` is the list [c, d, e]**
