The value of `f` is printed, which is the maximum value of the list `ary`. The values of `c`, `d`, and `e` are derived from `A` and `b`, but since their specific values are not provided, we can only state that `f` is equal to the maximum of these calculated values. The output will denote that `f` has been printed as part of the output. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`, `d` is equal to `A - b`, `e` is equal to `A * b`, `ary` is the list [c, d, e], `f` is equal to the maximum value of `ary`, and 'Max:' is printed with the value of `f`.**
