The function `func` accepts two parameters, `A` and `B`. Both `A` and `B` are integers constrained such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000. The function's output is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integer parameters `A` and `B`, each within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters A and B, which are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000.**
