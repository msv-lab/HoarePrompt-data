The variable `e` is assigned the value of `A * b`. The values of `A` and `b` are known: `A` is an integer and `b` is an input integer. Thus, `e` will be the product of these two values. The values of `c` and `d` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`, `d` is equal to `A - b`, and `e` is equal to `A * b`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`, `d` is equal to `A - b`, `e` is equal to `A * b**
