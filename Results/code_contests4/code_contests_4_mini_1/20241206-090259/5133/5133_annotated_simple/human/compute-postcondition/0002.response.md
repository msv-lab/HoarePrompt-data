The value of `c` is assigned the result of `A + b`. Here, `A` is an integer and `b` is an input integer. The exact values of `A` and `b` are not specified, so we cannot determine the specific value of `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`.

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b**
