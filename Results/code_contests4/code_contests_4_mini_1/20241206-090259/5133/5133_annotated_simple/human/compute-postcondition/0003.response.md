The variable `d` is assigned the value of `A - b`. Given that `b` is an input integer and `A` is an integer, the value of `d` will depend on the specific values of `A` and `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between these variables:

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`, `d` is equal to `A - b`.**
