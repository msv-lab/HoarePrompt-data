To determine the output state after running the provided code, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

**Initial State:** 
- `A` is an integer
- `B` is an integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is equal to `A + b`
- `d` is equal to `A - b`
- `e` is equal to `A * b`
- `ary` is the list `[c, d, e]`

The line of code executes the following:
```
f = max(ary)
```

1. The variable `ary` contains the values `[c, d, e]`, which are calculated based on the values of `A` and the input `b`.
2. The `max(ary)` function finds the maximum value among the elements of `ary`.
3. The value of `f` is assigned this maximum value.

Since the specific values of `A`, `B`, and the input integer `b` are not provided, we can summarize the output state by indicating that `f` now holds the maximum value from the list `ary`.

**Output State:** 
`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`, `d` is equal to `A - b`, `e` is equal to `A * b`, `ary` is the list [c, d, e], `f` is equal to the maximum value of `ary`. 

Output State: **`A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `A + b`, `d` is equal to `A - b`, `e` is equal to `A * b`, `ary` is the list [c, d, e], `f` is equal to the maximum value of `ary`.**
