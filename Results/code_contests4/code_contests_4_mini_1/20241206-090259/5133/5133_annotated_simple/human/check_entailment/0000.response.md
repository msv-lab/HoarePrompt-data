Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the input format specified in the problem description. The input is given in the format "A B" on a single line, but the program attempts to read the inputs separately with two calls to `input()`. This will lead to a `ValueError` when the program tries to read the second integer, as there will not be a separate line for it.

To fix this, the program should read the input as a single line and then split it into two separate integers. Here's how it should look:

```python
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c = a + b
    d = a - b
    e = a * b
    ary = [c, d, e]
    f = max(ary)
    print(f)
```

Additionally, the output format in the original program includes "Max:" before printing the maximum value, which does not match the problem description that simply states to print the largest value without any additional text.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
