The variable `ary` is assigned a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`. Since `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the difference `a - b`, and `e` is the product `a * b`, the list `ary` will contain these three calculated values. The states of the variables `A` and `B` are not directly affected by this assignment, but their values determine `c`, `d`, and `e`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `c` is the sum of input integers `a` and `b`; `d` is `a - b`; `e` is the product of `a` and `b`; `ary` is assigned the list [c, d, e].

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `c` is the sum of input integers `a` and `b`; `d` is `a - b`; `e` is the product of `a` and `b`; `ary` is assigned the list [c, d, e].**
