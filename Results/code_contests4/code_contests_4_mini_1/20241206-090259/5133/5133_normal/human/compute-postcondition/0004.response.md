The variable `e` is assigned the value of `a * b`. The values of `a` and `b` can be any integers within the range -1000 to 1000. Therefore, the value of `e` will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`. Since `A` and `B` are defined as integers and are not directly assigned values in this context, we can't specify a numerical value for `e`.

Thus, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `c` is the sum of input integers `a` and `b`; `d` is `a - b`; `e` is the product of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `c` is the sum of input integers `a` and `b`; `d` is `a - b`; `e` is the product of `a` and `b`.**
