The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the constraints, `A` and `B` are integers within the range of -1000 to 1000. However, since `A` and `B` are not passed as parameters to the function, we cannot determine how they influence the function's output directly from the provided information. Therefore, we need to focus on the output.

Since there is no output specified for the function, we cannot conclude a specific behavior. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is unspecified.**
