The variable `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`, where `a` and `b` are input integers. The values of `A` and `B` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `c` is the sum of input integers `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`A` and `B` are integers such that -1000 <= A, B <= 1000; `c` is the sum of input integers `a` and `b.**
