Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description correctly because it reads the inputs `A` and `B` from separate lines instead of a single line as described in the input format. In the problem description, input is given in the format "A B", which implies both integers should be read from a single line. The program's implementation will not work properly with the provided input format. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3 1
```
The program will read `3` as `a` and then wait for a separate input for `b`, which is not how the input is structured according to the problem description. Thus, the program will throw an error or behave incorrectly when given the input in the specified format. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle input as specified in the problem description.
