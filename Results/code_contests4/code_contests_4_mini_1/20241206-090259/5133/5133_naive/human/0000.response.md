Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the input format as described in the problem statement. The input is expected to be given on a single line in the format "A B", but the program reads two separate integers using `int(input())` which would lead to an error when attempting to execute the program. 

For example, if the input is provided as:
```
3 1
```
The program will attempt to read two separate lines instead of a single line which will not work correctly, thus violating the input specification of the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
