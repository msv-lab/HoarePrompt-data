Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any actual code to read or process the input values as specified in the problem description. The implementation is empty, which means it cannot perform the required actions to determine which days the roads will be asphalted. Since there is no logic implemented to handle the pairs of intersections and no output is generated, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function lacks any processing logic, which is critical for fulfilling the task. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for any potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
