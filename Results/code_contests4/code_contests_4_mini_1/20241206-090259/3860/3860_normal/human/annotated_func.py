#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the subsequent n² lines contain pairs of integers (hi, vi) where 1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n, representing distinct intersections in the schedule.
def func():
    """
    """
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and is intended to read an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 50, followed by n² pairs of integers (hi, vi) that represent distinct intersections in a schedule. However, the implementation does not actually include any logic to read or process these values, nor does it specify a return value. Therefore, while it is designed to handle input according to the stated conditions, it currently lacks the necessary code to perform these actions.
