The function does not accept any parameters and is intended to read an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 50, followed by nÂ² pairs of integers (hi, vi) that represent distinct intersections in a schedule. However, the implementation does not actually include any logic to read or process these values, nor does it specify a return value. Therefore, while it is designed to handle input according to the stated conditions, it currently lacks the necessary code to perform these actions.
