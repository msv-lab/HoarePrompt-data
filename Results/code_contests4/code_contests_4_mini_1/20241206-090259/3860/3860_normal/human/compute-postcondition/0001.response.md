The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it is designed to work with input values that are read internally, specifically an integer `n` that must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. Following this, the function expects to read n² lines that each contain pairs of integers (hi, vi), where each hi and vi must also satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n, representing distinct intersections in a schedule. 

The function does not specify a return value in the provided output description. Therefore, we cannot define a specific output to describe its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and reads an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 50, followed by n² pairs of integers (hi, vi) that represent distinct intersections in a schedule, but does not specify a return value.**
