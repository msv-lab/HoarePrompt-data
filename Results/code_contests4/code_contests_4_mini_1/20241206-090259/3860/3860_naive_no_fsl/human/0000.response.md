Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not include any implementation code. Therefore, it cannot perform any logic to determine which days the roads will be asphalted based on the given inputs. Without any code to analyze, we cannot verify correctness or handle any potential edge cases as described in the problem statement. 

For instance, if there were an implementation, it should be able to process the input intersections and keep track of which roads have already been asphalted. However, since there is no such logic implemented, it cannot meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Thus, the lack of implementation results in a failure to meet the problem's requirements, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
