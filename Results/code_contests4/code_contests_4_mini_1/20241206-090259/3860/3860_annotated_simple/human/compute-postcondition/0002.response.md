Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and processes a predefined set of n pairs of integers (hi, vi) representing intersections, but the code does not specify any logic or return any results based on those intersections. As it stands, the function lacks functionality and does not produce any output or handle the input described in the annotations. **
