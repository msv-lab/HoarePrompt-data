Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement any functionality. The function `func()` is defined but lacks any code to actually perform the task described in the problem statement. There are no operations to track the state of the roads or the schedule of intersections, which means it cannot determine which roads are asphalted based on the provided schedule.

For the program to be correct, it should:
1. Read the input values for `n` and the subsequent `nÂ²` pairs of intersections.
2. Maintain a record of which horizontal and vertical roads have been asphalted.
3. Iterate over the schedule of intersections, checking the state of the roads at each intersection, and updating the records accordingly.
4. Collect and print the days on which at least one road is asphalted.

Since the current implementation is empty and does not address any of these requirements, it fails to meet the problem description.
