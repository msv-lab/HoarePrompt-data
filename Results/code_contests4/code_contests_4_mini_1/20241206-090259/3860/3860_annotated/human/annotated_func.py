#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the schedule consists of n² distinct pairs of integers (hi, vi) where 1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n.
def func():
    """
    """
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) but does not perform any operations or return any values, meaning it does not process the schedule of n² distinct pairs of integers (hi, vi) as described in the annotations. Therefore, the function essentially does nothing.
