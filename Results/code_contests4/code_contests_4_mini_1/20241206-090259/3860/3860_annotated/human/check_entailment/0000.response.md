Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem requires a function that processes a schedule of intersections (pairs of integers representing the roads) and keeps track of which roads are asphalted based on the rules provided. However, the annotated program does not perform any operations, does not accept any input, and does not return any values. It essentially does nothing, which means it fails to implement the necessary logic to determine when road works will take place.

For example, given the input:

```
2
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

The expected output should be the days when roads are asphalted, which are `1` and `4`. The function needs to check if the roads are already asphalted before proceeding to asphalt them, but the current implementation does not process this logic at all.

In conclusion, the program is incorrect because it does not implement any functionality required to meet the problem's specifications.
