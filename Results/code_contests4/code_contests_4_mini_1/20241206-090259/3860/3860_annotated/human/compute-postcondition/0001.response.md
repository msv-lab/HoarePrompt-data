The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The function processes a schedule that consists of n² distinct pairs of integers (hi, vi), where each pair satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n. The function does not return a specific value in the traditional sense but likely performs operations based on the input pairs. However, without additional context on what the function outputs, we can summarize based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and processes a schedule of n² distinct pairs of integers (hi, vi) where (1 ≤ hi, vi ≤ n).**
