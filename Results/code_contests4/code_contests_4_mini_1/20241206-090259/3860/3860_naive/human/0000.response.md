The provided program appears to be missing entirely; there is no implementation between the triple quotes. Without any code to analyze, it is impossible to determine if it meets the problem description's requirements or handles the edge cases correctly.

Given this lack of implementation, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
