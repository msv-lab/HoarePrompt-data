The code takes an input line, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list from these integers. However, the specific values of `arr` are not provided in the initial state. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is based on the input provided by `raw_input()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, k â‰¤ 10^{14}; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
