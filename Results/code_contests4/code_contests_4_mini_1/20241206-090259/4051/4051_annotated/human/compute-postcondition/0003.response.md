Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the user, processes it into a list of integers, and returns this list. It assumes that the input will be well-formed integers separated by spaces. However, since there are no checks for input validity, if the input is not correctly formatted, it could result in a ValueError or an empty list being returned.**
