You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Tanechka is shopping in the toy shop. There are exactly n toys in the shop for sale, the cost of the i-th toy is i burles. She wants to choose two toys in such a way that their total cost is k burles. How many ways to do that does she have?

Each toy appears in the shop exactly once. Pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered equal. Pairs (a, b), where a=b, are not allowed.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{14}) — the number of toys and the expected total cost of the pair of toys.

Output

Print the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition above. Print 0, if Tanechka can choose no pair of toys in such a way that their total cost is k burles.

Examples

Input

8 5


Output

2


Input

8 15


Output

1


Input

7 20


Output

0


Input

1000000000000 1000000000001


Output

500000000000

Note

In the first example Tanechka can choose the pair of toys (1, 4) or the pair of toys (2, 3).

In the second example Tanechka can choose only the pair of toys (7, 8).

In the third example choosing any pair of toys will lead to the total cost less than 20. So the answer is 0.

In the fourth example she can choose the following pairs: (1, 1000000000000), (2, 999999999999), (3, 999999999998), ..., (500000000000, 500000000001). The number of such pairs is exactly 500000000000.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{14}.
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr
    #The program returns the list of integers 'arr' obtained from the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, processes it into a list of integers, and returns this list. It assumes that the input will be well-formed integers separated by spaces. However, since there are no checks for input validity, if the input is not correctly formatted, it could result in a ValueError or an empty list being returned.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
