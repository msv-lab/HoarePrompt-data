The code takes an input string, processes it by stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then maps each string to an integer. This means that `arr` will be assigned a list of integers based on the input. The values of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is determined by the new variable `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^14, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^14, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.**
