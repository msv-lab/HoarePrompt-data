The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly as it does not take any arguments in its definition. However, it operates based on two integer values, `n` and `k`, which are implied to be provided from some input. The constraints specify that both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^14. After executing the function body, it returns a list of integers named 'arr' obtained from the input. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return a list of integers based on some input derived from the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but returns a list of integers 'arr' obtained from input based on the values of n and k, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^14.**
