Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the number of ways Tanechka can choose two toys such that their total cost equals `k`. However, the given function `func_1` only reads input and returns a list of integers without performing any calculations or logic related to counting the valid pairs of toys.

Specifically, the program is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to:

1. Identify all pairs of toys based on their costs.
2. Count how many of those pairs sum up to `k`.
3. Handle the constraints that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered equal and that pairs must consist of different toys (a â‰  b).

Since the function fails to implement the core logic required to solve the problem, it does not meet the problem description's requirements. Therefore, it is not correct.
