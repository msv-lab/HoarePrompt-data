The variable `arr` is assigned the value obtained from `map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))`, which processes an input string by stripping whitespace, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and then creating a list from those integers. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, and the content of `arr` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^{14}; `arr` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^{14}; `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
