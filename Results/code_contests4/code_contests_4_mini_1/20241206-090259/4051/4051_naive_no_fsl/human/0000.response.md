Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. For instance, let's consider the case where `n = 8` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, since no pairs of toys can have a total cost of `1` (the minimum cost for any two different toys is `3`, from toys `1` and `2`), the expected output should be `0`. However, the program would return `0` because it checks `if n >= k`, which is true, but then the logic for calculating the pairs is flawed.

Another example is when `n = 10` and `k = 15`. The valid pairs that can be formed are `(5, 10)`, `(6, 9)`, and `(7, 8)`, which amounts to `3` pairs. The program fails to account for the pairs correctly due to its incorrect conditional logic.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
