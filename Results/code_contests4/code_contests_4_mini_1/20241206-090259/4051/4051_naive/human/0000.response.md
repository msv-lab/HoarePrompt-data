To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program computes the number of ways to choose two toys such that their total cost equals \( k \) burles.

The problem description states:
1. Each toy has a unique cost, which is equal to its index (from 1 to \( n \)).
2. We need to find pairs \( (a, b) \) such that \( a + b = k \) and \( a \neq b \).

Let's examine the program step by step:

```python
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
if n >= k:
    x = k - 1
    print(max(0, x // 2))
else:
    l = k - n
    l = n - l + 1
    print(max(0, l // 2))
```

1. The first line captures the input values \( n \) and \( k \).
2. The first condition checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \). If true, it calculates \( x = k - 1 \) and outputs \( \text{max}(0, x // 2) \).
   - This approach is flawed because it assumes that if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \), the number of pairs can be derived simply by halving \( k - 1 \). However, this does not account for the fact that both \( a \) and \( b \) must be less than or equal to \( n \), and \( a \) must be less than \( b \).
3. The else condition handles cases where \( n < k \). It calculates a different value for \( l \) and outputs \( \text{max}(0, l // 2) \).
   - Again, this calculation does not correctly account for pairs and their constraints since it relies on an incorrect derivation.

### Case Analysis:
- Case 1: For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 5 \), the expected output is \( 2 \) (pairs: (1, 4) and (2, 3)). The program should return \( 2 \) as it correctly calculates the pairs for this case.
- Case 2: For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 15 \), the expected output is \( 1 \) (pair: (7, 8)). The program should return \( 1 \) as it correctly calculates this case.
- Case 3: For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 20 \), the expected output is \( 0 \) (no valid pairs). The program should return \( 0 \).
- **Counterexample**: For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 11 \):
  - Valid pairs: (1, 10), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6). There are \( 5 \) valid pairs.
  - The program would calculate \( l \) incorrectly leading to an incorrect output.

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
