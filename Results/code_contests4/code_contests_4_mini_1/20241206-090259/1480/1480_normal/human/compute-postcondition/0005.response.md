The variable `s` is assigned the string value '0'. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `x`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1]; `s` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1]; `s` is '0'**.
