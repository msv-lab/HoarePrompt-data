The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s + '0' * a`. The initial value of `s` is the string '1', and the value of `a` can be any integer in the range [0, 99]. The expression `'0' * a` will produce a string consisting of the character '0' repeated `a` times. Thus, the resulting string `s` will be '1' followed by `a` zeros. The values of `x` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is 1, `a` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `b` is an integer in the range [0, 99], and `s` is '1' followed by `a` zeros.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `b` is an integer in the range [0, 99], and `s` is '1' followed by `a` zeros.**
