Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `s` is increased by '1'. Otherwise, if the last character of `s` is not '0', then `a` is in the range [0, 99], `b` is in the range [1, 100], and `s` is concatenated with '0'.***
