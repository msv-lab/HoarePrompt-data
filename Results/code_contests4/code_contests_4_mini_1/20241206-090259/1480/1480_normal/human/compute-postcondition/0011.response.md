`b` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `b` is within the range [1, 100], so after this operation, `b` will be in the range [0, 99]. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `x` is set to 2, and the last character of `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `x` is set to 2, and the last character of `s` is '1'**
