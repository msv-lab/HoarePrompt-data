Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `x` is set to 2. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `a` is in the range [0, 99], `b` is in the range [1, 100], and `s` is modified by appending '0'. Otherwise, when the last character of `s` is '1', `a` is in the range [1, 100], `b` is in the range [0, 99], and `x` remains set to 2.***
