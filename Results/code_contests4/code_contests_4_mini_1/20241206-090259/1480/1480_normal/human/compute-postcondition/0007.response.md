Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], and `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1]. If `x` is greater than 1 and `a` is equal to 1, then `b` is in the range [0, 99] and `s` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `a` is in the range [0, 99], `b` is in the range [1, 100], and `s` is set to '0'.***
