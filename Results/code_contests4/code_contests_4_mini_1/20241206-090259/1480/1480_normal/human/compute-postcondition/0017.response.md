According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop will only execute if `x` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 1. Thus, `x` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1 (for instance, `x` could be set to 2).

State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1**
