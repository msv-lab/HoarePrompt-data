The variable `s` is assigned the string value `'1'`. The values of the other variables `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is equal to 1; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1] and is greater than 1; `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 1; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1] and is greater than 1; `s` is '1'**.
