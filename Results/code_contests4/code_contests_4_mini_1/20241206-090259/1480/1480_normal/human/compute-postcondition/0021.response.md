The value of `a` is decremented by 1. Since `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], its new value will be in the range [0, 99]. The values of `b` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `s` is concatenated with '0'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `s` is concatenated with '0'**
