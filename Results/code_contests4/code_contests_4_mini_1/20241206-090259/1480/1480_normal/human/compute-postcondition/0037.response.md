The variable `s` is currently '1' followed by `a` zeros. The code appends `b` number of '1's to the end of `s`. Therefore, `s` will now be '1' followed by `a` zeros and then `b` ones. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected. Thus, the output state reflects the new composition of `s`.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `a` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `b` is an integer in the range [0, 99], `s` is '1' followed by `a` zeros and then `b` ones.**
