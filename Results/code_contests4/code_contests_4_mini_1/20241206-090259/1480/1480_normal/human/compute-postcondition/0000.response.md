The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where `raw_input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them into integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, but they remain within the range [1, 100]. The variable `x` is also reassigned a new value within the range [1, a + b - 1]. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `x` are now defined based on the inputs provided.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1] based on input.**
