`a` is decremented by 1. Since `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], the new value of `a` will be in the range [0, 99]. The values of `b` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [0, 99]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `s` is increased by the string '0'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [0, 99]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `s` is increased by the string '0'**.
