The value of `b` is decreased by 1. Since `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], its value can be between 1 and 100. After executing the code, `b` will be in the range [0, 99]. The values of `a` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is in the range [0, 99]; `s` is increased by '1'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is in the range [0, 99]; `s` is increased by '1'**
