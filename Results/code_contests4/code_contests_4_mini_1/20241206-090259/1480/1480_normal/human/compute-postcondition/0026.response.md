`b` is decremented by 1. The value of `b` is initially in the range [1, 100], so after execution, `b` will be in the range [0, 99]. The values of `a` and `s` are not affected, but `s` remains incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is in the range [0, 99]; `s` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is in the range [0, 99]; `s` is incremented by 1.**
