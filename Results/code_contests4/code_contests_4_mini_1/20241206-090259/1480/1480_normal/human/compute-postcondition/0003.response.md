`b` is decremented by 1, so its value will change from an integer in the range [1, 100] to an integer in the range [0, 99]. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is equal to 1; `b` is now an integer in the range [0, 99]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1] and is greater than 1; `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 1; `b` is now an integer in the range [0, 99]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1] and is greater than 1; `s` is '1'**.
