Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `a` is an integer in the range [0, 99], and `b` is an integer in the range [0, 99]. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `s` is a string of length 1 plus `b` occurrences of '1' followed by `a` occurrences of '0'. Otherwise, `s` is '1' followed by `a` zeros and then `b` ones.***
