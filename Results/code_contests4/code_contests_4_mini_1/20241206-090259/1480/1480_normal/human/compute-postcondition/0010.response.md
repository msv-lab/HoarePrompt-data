The code `s += '1'` appends the character '1' to the string `s`. The last character of `s` is currently '0', so after executing this line, the last character will be '1'. The values of the other variables `a`, `b`, and `x` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `x` is set to 2, and the last character of `s` is now '1'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `x` is set to 2, and the last character of `s` is now '1'**.
