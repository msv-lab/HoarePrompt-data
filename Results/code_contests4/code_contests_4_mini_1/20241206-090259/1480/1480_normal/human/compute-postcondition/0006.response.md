The value of `a` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], so after execution, `a` will be in the range [0, 99]. The other variables `b`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is in the range [0, 99]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1]; `s` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is in the range [0, 99]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `x` is an integer in the range [1, a + b - 1]; `s` is '0'**
