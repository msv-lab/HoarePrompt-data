The value of `s` is modified by appending the character '0' to it. Since the last character of `s` is not '0', the new string `s` will now end with '0'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `x` is set to 2, and `s` is modified by appending '0'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100], `x` is set to 2, and `s` is modified by appending '0'.**
