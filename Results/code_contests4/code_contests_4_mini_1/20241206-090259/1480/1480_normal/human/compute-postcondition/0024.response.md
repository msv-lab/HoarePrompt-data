According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 1, which means it must currently be at least 2 before the next iteration. 

Since `x` was decreased by 1, it must have been at least 3 before the decrease. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100]; for the loop to execute again, `x` must be at least 3**
