The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (both in the range [1, 100]) and an integer `x` (in the range [1, a + b - 1]). It constructs a binary string `s` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `x`. The string starts with either '1' or '0' depending on the conditions of `a` and `x`, and continues by alternating between '1's and '0's until the length of `s` equals `x`. Finally, it appends the remaining '1's and '0's based on the last character of `s`. The output is the constructed binary string.
