To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it constructs a binary string `s` correctly according to the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The string `s` must have exactly `a` zeroes and `b` ones.
2. There must be exactly `x` indices `i` (where `1 ≤ i < n`) such that `s[i] ≠ s[i + 1]`.

### Program Logic:
1. The program first reads the integers `a`, `b`, and `x`.
2. Depending on the value of `x` and `a`, it initializes the string `s` with either '1' or '0' and decrements `b` or `a` accordingly.
3. The program then enters a loop that continues until `x` is reduced to 1. Inside the loop, it alternates between adding '0' and '1' to `s` based on the last character of `s`, and decrements either `a` or `b` based on what was just added.
4. Once the loop ends, the program checks the last character of `s` and appends the remaining zeroes and ones to `s` based on that last character.

### Analysis:
- The loop constructs the string `s` with alternating characters up to `x-1` transitions, ensuring that there are `x` transitions (since the last character added after the loop does not count as a transition).
- After the loop, the program correctly appends the remaining zeroes or ones, ensuring the total counts of zeroes and ones are maintained.
- The guarantees provided in the problem statement (that a solution always exists) imply that the conditions checked in the program will not lead to an invalid state, as the code is structured to always append the remaining characters after achieving the required transitions.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem requirements by ensuring that:
- It constructs a string of length `n = a + b`.
- It maintains exactly `a` zeroes and `b` ones.
- It ensures that there are exactly `x` transitions.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
