Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. If `x` > 1 and `a` is 1, then `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < 100, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < 1 + b, and `s` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `s` is set to '0'.***
