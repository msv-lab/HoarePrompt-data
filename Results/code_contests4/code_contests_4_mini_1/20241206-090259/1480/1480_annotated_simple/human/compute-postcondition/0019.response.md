The value of `b` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `b` is not provided, but since `x` is decreased by 1 and the loop execution depends on `x` being greater than 2, we can infer that `b` is in a similar loop context. The state of `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is decreased by 1; `s` is now incremented to include '1'; `b` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is decreased by 1; `s` is now incremented to include '1'; `b` is decreased by 1.**
