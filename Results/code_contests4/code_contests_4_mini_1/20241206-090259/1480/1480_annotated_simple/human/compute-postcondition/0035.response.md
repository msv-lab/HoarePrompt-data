Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `s` is updated based on the number of iterations (which is `x - 1`), `a` and `b` are decremented accordingly based on the last character of `s` during the iterations. The last character of `s` is not '0', and the final values of `a` and `b` depend on the initial conditions and the behavior of `s` through the loop iterations.***
