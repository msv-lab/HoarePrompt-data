Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers a, b, and x, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. It constructs a binary string s based on the values of a, b, and x. If x > 1 and a is 1, it starts s with '1' and decrements b; otherwise, it starts with '0' and decrements a. It then continues to build the string until x is reduced to 1, alternating between appending '1's and '0's based on the last character of s, while decrementing a or b accordingly. Finally, it appends the remaining '1's or '0's based on the last character of s until all a and b are used up. The result is printed as the final binary string. **
