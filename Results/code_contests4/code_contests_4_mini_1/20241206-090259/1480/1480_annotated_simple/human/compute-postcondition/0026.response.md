`b` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `b` is unknown and remains unchanged. The values of `x` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to include '1', and `b` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to include '1', `b` is decreased by 1**
