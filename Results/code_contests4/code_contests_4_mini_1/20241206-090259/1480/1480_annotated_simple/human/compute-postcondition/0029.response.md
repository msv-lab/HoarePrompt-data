Postcondition: ***`x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to include '1' and `b` is decreased by 1 if the last character of `s` is '0'. Otherwise, `x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to the previous value of `s` concatenated with '0', and `b` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 1.***
