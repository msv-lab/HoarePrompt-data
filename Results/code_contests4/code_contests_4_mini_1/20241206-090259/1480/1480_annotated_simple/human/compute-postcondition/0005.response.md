The variable `s` is assigned the string value '0'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b; `s` is '0'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b; `s` is '0'**
