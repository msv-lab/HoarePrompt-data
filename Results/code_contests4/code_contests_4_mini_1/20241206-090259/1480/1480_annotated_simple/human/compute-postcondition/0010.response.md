The code appends the character '1' to the string `s`. Since the last character of `s` is '0', after the execution, the last character will now be '1'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, and `s` ends with '1' after modification.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, and `s` ends with '1'.**
