Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. If `s` ends with '0', then `a` is decreased by 1, `b` remains unchanged, and `s` ends with '1'. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `b` ≤ 99, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` < `a + b`, and '0' is appended to `s`.***
