The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `x` was already decreased by 1 before this code execution, but the exact current value of `x` is not specified. The states of `s` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to include '1', and `b` is decreased by 1 if the last character of `s` is '0'; otherwise, `x` is decreased by 1 again, `s` remains the same, and `b` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to include '1', and `b` is decreased by 1 if the last character of `s` is '0'; otherwise, `x` is decreased by 1 again, `s` remains the same, and `b` remains unchanged.**
