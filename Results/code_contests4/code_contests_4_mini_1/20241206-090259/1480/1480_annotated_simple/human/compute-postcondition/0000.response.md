The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which accepts a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `x` depend on the input provided, but the conditions state that they must adhere to the constraints: 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. Since we do not know the specific input values, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `x` after execution. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b as assigned from input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b as assigned from input.**
