The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `x`. All three parameters are integers with constraints that ensure 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. The function does not return any specific output described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `a`, `b`, and `x` under the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and x, which are integers with constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b.**
