According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must currently be greater than 1. Therefore, `x` must have been greater than 2 at the start of this iteration.

State: **`x` is decreased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must have been greater than 2**
