Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, if the last character of `s` is '0', then `s` is updated to '0' * `a`, where `s` was previously empty. Otherwise, `s` is updated by appending '1' repeated `b` times, where `s` remains unchanged from its previous state. The final values of `a` and `b` depend on the initial conditions and the behavior of `s` through the loop iterations.***
