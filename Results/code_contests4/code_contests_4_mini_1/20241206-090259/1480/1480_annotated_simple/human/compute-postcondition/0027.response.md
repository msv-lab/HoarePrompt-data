The value of `s` is updated by concatenating '0' to it. The values of `x`, `b`, and the unchanged `s` are noted. Since `s` was unchanged prior, it now reflects the addition of '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to be the previous value of `s` concatenated with '0', `b` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to be the previous value of `s` concatenated with '0', `b` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.**
