The variable `s` is assigned the string value `'1'`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `x`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `s` while maintaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, and `s` is '1'**
