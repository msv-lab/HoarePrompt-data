The value of `a` is decremented by 1. Since `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, the new value of `a` will be in the range of 0 to 99 after the decrement. The values of `b`, `x`, and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is now an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 99, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x < a + b, and `s` has '0' appended to it.

Output State: **`a` is now an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 99, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x < a + b, and `s` has '0' appended to it.**
