The value of `b` is decremented by 1. Since `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, after the decrement, `b` will still satisfy the condition of being at least 1. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 1, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < 100, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < 1 + b, and `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b < 100, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < 1 + b, and `s` is '1'**
