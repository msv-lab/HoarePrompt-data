The value of `s` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. The values of `x`, `b`, and any other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for the loop to execute again is still dependent on `x` being greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to include '1', `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is decreased by 1, `s` is updated to include '1', `b` remains unchanged**
