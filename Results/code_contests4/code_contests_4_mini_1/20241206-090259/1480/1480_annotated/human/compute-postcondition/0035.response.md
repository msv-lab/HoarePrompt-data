Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `a` is decreased by the number of times the loop executed when `s` ended with '0', `b` is decreased by the number of times the loop executed when `s` ended with '1'. The total number of iterations is equal to the initial value of `x` minus 1. The last character of `s` is not '0', therefore it must be '1'.***
