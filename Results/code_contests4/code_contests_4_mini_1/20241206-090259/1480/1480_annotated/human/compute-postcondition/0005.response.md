The variable `s` is assigned the string value `'0'`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `x`, along with the new assignment of `s`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned new integer values based on user input, satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b; `s` is '0'**
