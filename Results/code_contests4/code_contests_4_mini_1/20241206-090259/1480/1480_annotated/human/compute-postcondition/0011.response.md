The value of `b` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `b` is not specified, only that it is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is now one less than its previous value, `x` is greater than 1, and `s` is now `s` concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is now one less than its previous value, `x` is greater than 1, and `s` is now `s` concatenated with '1'.**
