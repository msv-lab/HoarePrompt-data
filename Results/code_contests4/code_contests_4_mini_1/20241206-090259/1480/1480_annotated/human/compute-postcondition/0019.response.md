The statement `b -= 1` decrements the value of `b` by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. Since `b` is an integer satisfying the condition 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, after the decrement, `b` will be either 0 (if it was initially 1) or some other integer between 1 and 99. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100; `b` is decremented by 1; `x` is an integer; `s` is the previous value concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100; `b` is decremented by 1; `x` is an integer; `s` is the previous value concatenated with '1'**.
