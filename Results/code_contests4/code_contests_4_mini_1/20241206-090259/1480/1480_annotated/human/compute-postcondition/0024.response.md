According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must have been greater than 1 before the decrement, which means it must have been at least 2 before the last iteration.

State: **`a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, and for the loop to execute again `x` must have been at least 2 before the last decrement**.
