Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`. If `x` > 1 and `a` is equal to 1, then `b` is decreased by 1, `x` remains unchanged, and `s` is '1'. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `s` is '0'.***
