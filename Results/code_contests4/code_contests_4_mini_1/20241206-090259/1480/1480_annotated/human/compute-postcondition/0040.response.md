The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `x`. All three parameters are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. After executing the function body, the output is not specified in the provided details, so we cannot determine specific return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `x` under the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a, b, and x, which are integers constrained by 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b.**
