Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `a` is decreased by the number of times the loop executed when `s` ended with '0', and `b` is decreased by the number of times the loop executed when `s` ended with '1'. If `s` ends with '0', `s` is updated to '1' * b followed by '0' * a. Otherwise, `s` is appended with '1' * b.***
