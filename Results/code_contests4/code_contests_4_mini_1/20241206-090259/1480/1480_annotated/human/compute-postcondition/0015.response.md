Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and `x` is greater than 1. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `b` is decremented by 1 and `s` is updated by concatenating '1'. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by 1, `b` remains within the range 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, and `s` is updated by appending '0' to it.***
