The code assigns new values to `a`, `b`, and `x` using the `map` function to convert the input from `raw_input()` into integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` will be determined by the user's input, but they must satisfy the conditions given in the initial state (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b). The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are overwritten by the input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `x` now hold the values provided by the user.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned new integer values based on user input, satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b.**
