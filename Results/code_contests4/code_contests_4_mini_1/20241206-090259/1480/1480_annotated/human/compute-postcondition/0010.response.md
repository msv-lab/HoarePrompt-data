The value of `s` is appended with the string '1', but the previous value of `s` is unknown. The variables `a`, `b`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100, `x` is greater than 1; `s` is now `s` concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100, `x` is greater than 1; `s` is now `s` concatenated with '1'.**
