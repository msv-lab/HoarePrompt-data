The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s + '1'`, which means that '1' is concatenated to the current value of `s`. However, since the previous value of `s` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100; `s` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100; `s` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value.**
