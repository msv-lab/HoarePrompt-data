Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `b` is decremented by 1, and `s` is updated by concatenating '1'. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and `s` is updated by concatenating '0'.***
