The value of `b` is decremented by 1, which means it will now hold a value that is one less than its previous value. The previous value of `b` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, so after the operation, `b` will still satisfy the same condition. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is equal to 1; `b` is now one less than its previous value; `x` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, and `s` is '1'.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 1; `b` is now one less than its previous value; `x` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, and `s` is '1'**.
