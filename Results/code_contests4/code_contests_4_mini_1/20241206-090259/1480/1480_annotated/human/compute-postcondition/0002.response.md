The variable `s` is assigned the string value `'1'`. The previous values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged because this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is equal to 1; `b` and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, and `x` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 1; `b` and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, and `x` is greater than 1; `s` is '1'**
