The value of `b` is decremented by 1, but the specific previous value of `b` is not provided beyond the constraint of 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100. Therefore, after execution, `b` will be either 0 (if `b` was 1) or a value between 1 and 99 (if `b` was greater than 1). The values of `a` and `s` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100; `b` is either 0 or an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 99; `s` is incremented by '1'.**
