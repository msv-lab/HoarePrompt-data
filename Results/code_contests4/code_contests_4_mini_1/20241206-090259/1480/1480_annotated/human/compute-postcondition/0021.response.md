The variable `a` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, so after this operation, the new value of `a` will be one less than its previous value. The values of `b`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is decreased by 1; `b` is unchanged; `x` is unchanged; `s` is increased by '0'.**
