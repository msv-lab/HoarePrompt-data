The value of `a` is decremented by 1. Since `a` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, the new value of `a` will be at least 0, but still an integer. The values of `b`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is now decremented by 1, `b` is still an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `x` is still greater than 1, and `s` is updated by appending '0' to it.

Output State: **`a` is now decremented by 1, `b` is still an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `x` is still greater than 1, and `s` is updated by appending '0' to it.**
