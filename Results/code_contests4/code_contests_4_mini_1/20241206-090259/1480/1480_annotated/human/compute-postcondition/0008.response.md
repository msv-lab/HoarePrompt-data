To determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition `x > 1`. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ x < a + b`.
- We also have the conditions that if `x > 1` and `a` equals 1, then `b` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by 1.

For the loop to execute at least one time, the crucial condition is that `x` must be greater than 1. 

Since we know that:
1. `1 ≤ x < a + b`, it follows that if `x` is currently greater than 1, the loop can execute.
2. If `x` is less than or equal to 1, then the loop cannot execute.

So, the key points to ensure the loop executes at least once are:
- We need `x` to be greater than 1.

Given the constraints, if `x` is currently greater than 1, we can proceed without making adjustments. However, if `x` is equal to 1, we can increase `x` to ensure the loop can execute.

Thus, assuming `x` is currently 1, we can adjust `x` to be 2 (since it must be less than `a + b`).

Therefore, the adjusted state can be expressed as follows:

State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and `x` is adjusted to be greater than 1**
