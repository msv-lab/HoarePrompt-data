The function accepts three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `x`, where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ x < a + b`. It constructs a binary string `s` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `x`. The string starts with '1' if `x > 1` and `a` is `1`, otherwise it starts with '0'. The function alternates appending '1's and '0's to `s` according to the remaining counts of `a` and `b` after `x` has been decremented to `1`. Finally, it appends any remaining '1's or '0's based on the last character of the string, ensuring the total counts of '1's and '0's correspond to the initial values of `a` and `b`. The resulting binary string is printed.
