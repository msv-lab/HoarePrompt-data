To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem statement, I will analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires determining if two nodes in a directed graph belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC). For each query of node pairs, the program should output "1" if they belong to the same SCC and "0" otherwise.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Graph Representation**: The program constructs both a graph (`g`) and its reverse (`rg`). This is necessary for Tarjan's or Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs.
2. **DFS Functions**: 
   - `func_1`: Adds edges to the graph and its reverse.
   - `func_2`: Performs a DFS on the original graph to fill a backtrack list based on finish times.
   - `func_3`: Performs a DFS on the reversed graph to assign components.
3. **Component Assignment**: After running the DFS on both the original and reversed graphs, the nodes are assigned to their respective components.
4. **Query Handling**: For each query, it checks if the components of the two nodes are the same and prints "1" or "0" accordingly.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Single Node with No Edges**: If there is a single node (e.g., `|V| = 1` and `|E| = 0`), the query for the same node should return "1".
2. **Disconnected Graphs**: The program should correctly identify pairs of nodes in disconnected components.
3. **Self-loops**: Nodes with self-loops should be correctly identified as being in the same component with themselves.
4. **Bidirectional Edges**: If there are two nodes with edges in both directions, they should be identified as in the same SCC.

### Potential Issue:
The program uses `xrange`, which is not defined in Python 3 (it should be `range`). This will lead to a runtime error if executed in a Python 3 environment. Additionally, if the input is not well-formed according to the expectations (like negative indices), the program does not seem to have error handling.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program has a significant issue (not running in Python 3 due to `xrange`) and potential for misbehaving with malformed input or edge cases, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
