The function accepts a directed graph represented as a list of edges and a list of queries. It appends edges to the graph representation and its reverse, but does not process the queries or return any results regarding paths between nodes as suggested. Therefore, the function only modifies the graph structure without fulfilling the intended purpose of answering the queries.
