According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `back_track` list. The loop iterates over the elements of `back_track` in reverse order. For the loop to execute at least once, `back_track` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes, `back_track` should be a list of length `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, `back_track` will have elements to iterate over. 

Assuming `back_track` is initialized based on `n`, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `v` will take on the value of the last element in the `back_track` list for the first iteration.

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cmp` is 0, and for the loop to execute the first time, `v` is the last element in `back_track`**
