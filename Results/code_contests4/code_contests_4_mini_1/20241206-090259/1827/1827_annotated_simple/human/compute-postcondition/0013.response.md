Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with values indicating which nodes were visited (True for visited, False for unvisited), `back_track` is a list that may contain information related to the traversal of the nodes, `cmp` is a list of length `n` that remains unchanged and contains all values set to `-1`, and `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the directed graph.**
