The variable `used` is assigned a new list with the length of `n`, where all elements are set to `False`, indicating that none of the nodes have been visited. The previous values of `used` are not specified, but they will be overwritten. The lists `back_track` and `cmp` remain unchanged, and `n` continues to represent the number of nodes in the directed graph.

Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False; `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1; `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes.**
