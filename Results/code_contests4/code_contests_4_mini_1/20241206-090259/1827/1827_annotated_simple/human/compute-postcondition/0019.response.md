The value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` is 0, so after execution, `num_cmp` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False; `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1; `n` is greater than 0; `num_cmp` is 1; `v` is the last element in `back_track`; the value of `used[v]` is False.

Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False; `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1; `n` is greater than 0; `num_cmp` is 1; `v` is the last element in `back_track`; the value of `used[v]` is False.**
