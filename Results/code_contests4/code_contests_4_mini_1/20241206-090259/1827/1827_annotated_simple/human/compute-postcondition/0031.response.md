The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. After executing the function body, the program returns two outputs: the count of processed nodes `num_cmp` and the updated list `cmp` based on processed nodes. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph and return the count of processed nodes along with an updated list based on those nodes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n representing the number of nodes in a directed graph and returns the count of processed nodes and an updated list based on those nodes.**
