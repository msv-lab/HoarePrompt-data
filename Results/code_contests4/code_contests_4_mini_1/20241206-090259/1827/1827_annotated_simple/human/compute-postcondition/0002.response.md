The variable `cmp` is assigned a list of length `n` where each element is initialized to `-1`. The previous state of the variables is not affected by this assignment. The variable `used` remains a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`, and `back_track` remains an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the directed graph; `used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the directed graph; `used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `-1`.**
