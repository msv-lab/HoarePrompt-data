Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False; `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1; `n` is greater than 0; if `used[v]` is False, then `num_cmp` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_cmp` remains 0; for the loop to execute one more time `v` is the second last element in the reversed `back_track` list; function `func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)` is called.**
