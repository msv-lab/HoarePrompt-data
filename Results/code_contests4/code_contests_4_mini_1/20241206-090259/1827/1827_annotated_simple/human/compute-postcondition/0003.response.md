According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning it will execute if `n` is at least 1. The initial states of `used`, `back_track`, and `cmp` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself but indicate that the program is set up for processing nodes in a directed graph.

For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `v` will start at 0 during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `v` is 0**
