According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `back_track` list to iterate through. The `back_track[::-1]` notation indicates that we are iterating over `back_track` in reverse order. Since `used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False, and `n` is greater than 0, we can assume that `back_track` has at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, `v` represents the last element processed in the reversed `back_track` list. To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next element in the reversed list. 

If the length of `back_track` is greater than 1, then there will still be elements left to iterate over. Since the loop can execute as long as there are elements in `back_track`, we need to set `v` to the next element in the reversed order, which corresponds to the previous index of `back_track`.

Assuming that `back_track` has at least two elements, if `v` is the last element processed in the last iteration, we can denote it as `v = back_track[-1]`. For the next iteration, `v` will be the second last element in the list `back_track`, which can be indexed as `back_track[-2]`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to reflect that `v` is now set to the next element in `back_track`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False; `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1; `n` is greater than 0; if `used[v]` is False, then `num_cmp` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_cmp` remains 0; for the loop to execute one more time `v` is the second last element in the reversed `back_track` list.**
