According to the code, the for loop iterates over the elements in `back_track` in reverse order. The loop variable `v` takes on each value from `back_track` starting from the last element down to the first. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1, and `n` is greater than 0. We also know that if `used[v]` is False, then `num_cmp` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_cmp` remains unchanged.

To determine the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the current value of `v` and the structure of `back_track`. Since the loop iterates in reverse, for the loop to execute again, we need to check the length of `back_track`. If `back_track` has at least one more element to iterate over, we can adjust our state accordingly.

Assuming the previous iteration processed the last element of `back_track`, we would set `v` to the next element in reverse order. Therefore, if the loop has iterated through all elements of `back_track`, we would need to ensure that there are still elements left for the loop to execute again.

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1, `n` is greater than 0; for the loop to execute one more time, `back_track` must have at least one more element, and `v` should refer to the next element in reverse order of the list.**
