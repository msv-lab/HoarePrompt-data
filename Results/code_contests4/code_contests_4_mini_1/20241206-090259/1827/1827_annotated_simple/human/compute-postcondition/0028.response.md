Postcondition: ***`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to False, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to -1, `n` is greater than 0, and `v` refers to the next element in reverse order of the list; if `used[v]` is False, then `num_cmp` is increased by 1.***
