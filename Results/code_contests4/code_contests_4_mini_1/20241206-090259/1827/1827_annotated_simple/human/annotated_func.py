#State of the program right berfore the function call: frm is a directed graph represented as a list of edges where each edge is a tuple (si, ti) indicating a directed edge from si to ti, and to is a list of queries where each query is a tuple (ui, vi) representing a pair of nodes. The graph contains |V| nodes (0 to |V|-1) and |E| edges, with constraints 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000 and 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000. The number of queries Q is between 1 and 100,000.
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a directed graph represented as a list of edges and a list of queries. It appends edges to the graph representation and its reverse, but does not process the queries or return any results regarding paths between nodes as suggested. Therefore, the function only modifies the graph structure without fulfilling the intended purpose of answering the queries.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is a node in the directed graph represented by integers from 0 to |V|-1, used is a set of nodes that have been visited, and back_track is a data structure used to manage the traversal of the graph. The graph has |V| nodes (1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000) and |E| edges (0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000), and the queries consist of pairs of nodes (u, v) where 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000.
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used[now]` is True, `g[now]` is a list of neighboring nodes, and `used[nx]` is True for all `nx` in `g[now]`.
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a directed graph, a set `used` to track visited nodes, and a list `back_track` to record the traversal order. It marks the current node as visited, recursively visits all unvisited neighboring nodes, and appends the current node to the `back_track` list after all neighbors have been processed. This function effectively performs a depth-first traversal of the directed graph and maintains the order of nodes visited in `back_track`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node, num_cmp is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, used is a list of booleans indicating whether nodes have been visited, and cmp is a list of integers representing the component each node belongs to, where the number of nodes |V| is between 1 and 10,000 and the number of edges |E| is between 0 and 30,000.
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is the current node, `num_cmp` is the number of strongly connected components, `used` has all nodes reachable from `now` marked as `True`, and `cmp` has all reachable nodes from `now` assigned the value `num_cmp`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now`, an integer `num_cmp`, a list of booleans `used`, and a list of integers `cmp`. It marks the current node `now` as visited and assigns it to the component `num_cmp`. The function then recursively visits all reachable nodes from `now`, marking them as visited and associating them with the same component. The function is primarily used for traversing a directed graph and identifying strongly connected components. It does not handle cases where nodes are not connected, nor does it address potential edge cases such as empty graphs or nodes that do not exist in the context of the graph representation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the directed graph, and the graph is defined by a list of edges (pairs of integers) with constraints on the number of nodes (1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000) and edges (0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000). Each query consists of a pair of nodes (u, v) where 0 ≤ u, v < n.
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used` is a list of length `n` with values indicating which nodes were visited (True for visited, False for unvisited), `back_track` is a list that may contain information related to the traversal of the nodes, `cmp` is a list of length `n` that remains unchanged and contains all values set to `-1`, and `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the directed graph.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used` is a list of length `n` indicating which nodes have been processed (True for processed, False for unprocessed); `back_track` is unchanged; `cmp` remains a list of length `n` with values updated based on processed nodes; `n` is a non-negative integer; `num_cmp` is the count of nodes processed (increased for each unprocessed node).
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the count of processed nodes 'num_cmp' and the updated list 'cmp' based on processed nodes
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the nodes through two main traversals, likely to identify strongly connected components, and returns two values: the count of processed components `num_cmp` and an updated list `cmp` that indicates the component assignment for each node. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0, but it assumes valid input as per the problem constraints.
