The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the nodes through two main traversals, likely to identify strongly connected components, and returns two values: the count of processed components `num_cmp` and an updated list `cmp` that indicates the component assignment for each node. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0, but it assumes valid input as per the problem constraints.
