n is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the directed graph, and the graph is defined by a list of edges (pairs of integers) with constraints on the number of nodes (1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000) and edges (0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000). Each query consists of a pair of nodes (u, v) where 0 ≤ u, v < n.
