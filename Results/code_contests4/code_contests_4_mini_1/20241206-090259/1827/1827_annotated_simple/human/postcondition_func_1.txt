The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a directed graph, a set `used` to track visited nodes, and a list `back_track` to record the traversal order. It marks the current node as visited, recursively visits all unvisited neighboring nodes, and appends the current node to the `back_track` list after all neighbors have been processed. This function effectively performs a depth-first traversal of the directed graph and maintains the order of nodes visited in `back_track`.
