The function accepts an integer `now`, an integer `num_cmp`, a list of booleans `used`, and a list of integers `cmp`. It marks the current node `now` as visited and assigns it to the component `num_cmp`. The function then recursively visits all reachable nodes from `now`, marking them as visited and associating them with the same component. The function is primarily used for traversing a directed graph and identifying strongly connected components. It does not handle cases where nodes are not connected, nor does it address potential edge cases such as empty graphs or nodes that do not exist in the context of the graph representation.
