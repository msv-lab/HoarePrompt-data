Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully implement the requirements specified in the problem description. While it includes functions to traverse a directed graph and identify strongly connected components (SCCs), it lacks the necessary integration to handle the queries that determine whether two nodes belong to the same SCC.

In more detail:

1. **Missing Query Handling**: The program does not contain any logic for processing the sequence of queries that check if pairs of nodes (u, v) belong to the same strongly connected component. The final output should be a sequence of "1" or "0" based on whether the nodes in each query are in the same SCC, but this is absent.

2. **Graph Initialization**: The program defines functions to build the graph and perform depth-first search (DFS) but does not include the initialization of the graph structure (`g` and `rg`) or how the edges are added to these structures before querying.

3. **Output Logic**: After identifying the SCCs, the program needs to compare the components of the queried nodes and output the corresponding results ("1" for the same component and "0" for different components). This part is missing, leading to incomplete functionality.

Due to these reasons, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description effectively. It lacks complete input processing and output generation for the queries, which is crucial for determining if nodes u and v are in the same strongly connected component.
