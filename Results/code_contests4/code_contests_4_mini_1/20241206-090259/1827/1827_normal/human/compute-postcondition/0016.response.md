According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `back_track` variable. The loop iterates over the reversed version of `back_track`. For the loop to execute at least once, `back_track` must contain at least one element. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, it implies that the `used` list has a length of `n`, and thus, `back_track` must also have at least one element for the loop to start executing. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `v` will take the values from `back_track` in reverse order. Since `v` is initialized as `n - 1`, this indicates that the loop variable `v` will be set to the last element of `back_track` when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` is a list with at least 1 element, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 0, `v` is `n - 1` (the last element of back_track)**
