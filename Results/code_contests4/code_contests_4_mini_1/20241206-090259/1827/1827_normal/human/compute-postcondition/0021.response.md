According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `back_track` list. The loop iterates over the elements of `back_track` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is `n - 1`, and `used[v]` is `False`, which means that after this iteration, `v` will take on the next value from `back_track` when the loop executes again. 

Since `back_track` has at least one element, the `v` value will now be the next element in the reverse order. If `back_track` has `k` elements, the next value of `v` will correspond to the index `k - 2` in the reverse order, meaning `v` should be adjusted accordingly.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `v` is set to the next element in the reversed `back_track`, which effectively means decrementing it to point to the previous value in the original order of `back_track`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` has at least 2 elements, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 2, and `v` is `n - 2`**
