`num_cmp` is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` is unchanged, `v` is `n - 1`, and `num_cmp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` is unchanged, `v` is `n - 1`, `num_cmp` is 0**.
