The function `func_2(v, used, back_track)` is called with the arguments `v`, `used`, and `back_track`. The values of these variables do not change during the function call itself, but the function is expected to modify `used` and `back_track` based on its internal logic. However, since we don't have the implementation details of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact state of `used` and `back_track` after the function call. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and we know that `used` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `back_track` is empty, and `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1, we can summarize the output state with the known information.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1, `v` is 2; the function `func_2` has been called but the values of `used` and `back_track` are unknown.**
