Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1, and `v` is 2. If `used[v]` is False, the function `func_2` has been called, but the resulting values of `used` and `back_track` are unknown.***
