The variable `cmp` is assigned a list of size `n` with all elements initialized to `-1`. The initial state of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000, which means `cmp` will have a length equal to `n` filled with the value `-1`. The variables `used` and `back_track` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph; `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1.**
