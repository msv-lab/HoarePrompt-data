According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `v` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `v` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again. 

In the next iteration, `v` will be incremented by 1, so `v` will become 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1, and `v` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
