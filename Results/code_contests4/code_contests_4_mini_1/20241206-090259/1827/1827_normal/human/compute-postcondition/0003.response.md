According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, and it is stated that `n` is positive, the loop will execute at least once. Additionally, the loop variable `v` will start at 0 for the first iteration. 

The states that need to be acknowledged before the loop starts include the initialization of `n`, `used`, `back_track`, and `cmp`, but they do not need adjustment for the loop to execute since they are already in the expected state. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `v` must be initialized to 0, which it will be during the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1, `v` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
