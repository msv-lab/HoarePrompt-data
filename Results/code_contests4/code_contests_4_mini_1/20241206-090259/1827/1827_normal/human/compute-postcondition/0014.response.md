The code initializes the `used` list with `n` boolean values, all set to `False`, indicating that no nodes have been processed yet. This assignment directly affects the `used` variable, while the other variables (`back_track`, `cmp`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values, all set to `False`, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` is unchanged, and `v` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` is unchanged, `v` is `n - 1**
