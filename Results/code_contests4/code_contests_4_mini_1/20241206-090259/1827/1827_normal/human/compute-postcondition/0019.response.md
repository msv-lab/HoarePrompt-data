The value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` is 0, so after execution, `num_cmp` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` is a list with at least 1 element, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 1, `v` is `n - 1`, and the value of `used[v]` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` is a list with at least 1 element, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 1, `v` is `n - 1`, and the value of `used[v]` is `False`**.
