The variable `back_track` is assigned an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. The `used` list also remains unchanged, still holding `False` for each of the `n` nodes. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list.**
