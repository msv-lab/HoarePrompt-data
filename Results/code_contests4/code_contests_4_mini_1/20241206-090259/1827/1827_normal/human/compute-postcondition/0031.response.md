The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000. After executing the function body, it returns two values: the count of how many times 'func_3' was called as `num_cmp`, and the current value of `cmp`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph and return the count of calls to `func_3` and the current value of `cmp`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in a directed graph and returns the count of how many times 'func_3' was called as num_cmp and the current value of cmp.**
