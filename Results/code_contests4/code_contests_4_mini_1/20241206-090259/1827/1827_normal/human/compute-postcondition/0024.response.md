Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` has at least 2 elements, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 2, and `v` is `n - 2`. If `used[v]` is `False`, then `num_cmp` is updated to 3 and the function `func_3` is called with the arguments `(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)`.***
