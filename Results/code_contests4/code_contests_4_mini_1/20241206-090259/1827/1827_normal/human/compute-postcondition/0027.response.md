The value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` was 2, so after execution, `num_cmp` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` has at least 3 elements, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 3, `v` is the third last element in the original `back_track`, and the function `func_3` was called with parameters `(v, 2, used, cmp)`.
