The value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` is 2, so after execution, `num_cmp` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` has at least 2 elements, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 3, `v` is `n - 2`, and the function `func_3` is called with the arguments `(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` has at least 2 elements, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 3, `v` is `n - 2`, and the function `func_3` is called with the arguments `(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)`**.
