The variable `used` is assigned a list of boolean values, each initialized to `False`. The size of the list is determined by the value of `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the directed graph. Therefore, if `n` is, for example, 5, `used` will be `[False, False, False, False, False]`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000; `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`.**
