According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and the list `used`. If `v` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 1, and since `used[v]` is initialized to `False`, it implies that `func_2` was called. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `v` being 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `v` must be less than `n` (which is still a positive integer). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1, and `v` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2**.
