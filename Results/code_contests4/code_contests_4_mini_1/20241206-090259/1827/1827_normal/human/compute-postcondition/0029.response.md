The loop iterates over the elements of `back_track` in reverse order. For each value `v`, it checks if `used[v]` is `False`. If it is, the function `func_3` is called with parameters `(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)`, and `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. 

After all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `used` is a list of `n` boolean values, where some elements may be set to `True` depending on how many times `func_3` was called. 
- `back_track` remains unchanged.
- `cmp` remains unchanged.
- `num_cmp` will equal the count of how many times `func_3` was called, which is the number of `False` entries in `used` corresponding to the values of `v` in `back_track`.

If `back_track` has `k` elements and if all corresponding `used[v]` were `False`, then `num_cmp` would be `k`. If some of the entries were `True`, `num_cmp` would be less than `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values with some set to `True`, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is the count of how many times `func_3` was called, and `v` is the last value iterated over from `back_track`.**
