Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`, `back_track` is a list with at least 1 element, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is 1, and `v` is `n - 1`. If `used[v]` is `False`, then `used[v]` remains `False` and `num_cmp` is incremented to 1.***
