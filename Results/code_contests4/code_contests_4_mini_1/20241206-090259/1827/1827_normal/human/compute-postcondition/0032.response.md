Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the graph by calling two other functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) to identify strongly connected components. It returns `num_cmp`, the count of how many times `func_3` was called, and `cmp`, a list that represents the component to which each node belongs. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which may lead to unexpected behavior. **
