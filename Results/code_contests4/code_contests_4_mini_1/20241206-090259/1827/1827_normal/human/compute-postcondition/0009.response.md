Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of size `n` filled with -1, and `v` is 1; if `used[v]` is False, the function `func_2` is called with these parameters. If `used[v]` is True, no action is taken.***
