The function accepts two parameters, `frm` and `to`, which are lists of edges represented as tuples in a directed graph. It adds directed edges from nodes in `frm` to nodes in `to` and also tracks the reverse edges. However, it does not return any value, nor does it handle cases where the inputs are empty or contain invalid edges.
