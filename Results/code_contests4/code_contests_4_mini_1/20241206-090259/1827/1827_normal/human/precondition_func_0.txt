frm and to are lists of edges represented as tuples (s, t) where s and t are integers such that 0 <= s, t < |V|, and |V| is the number of nodes in the directed graph. The number of edges |E| can range from 0 to 30,000 and there can be up to 100,000 queries consisting of pairs of nodes (u, v) where 0 <= u, v < |V|.
