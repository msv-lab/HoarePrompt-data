#State of the program right berfore the function call: frm and to are lists of edges represented as tuples (s, t) where s and t are integers such that 0 <= s, t < |V|, and |V| is the number of nodes in the directed graph. The number of edges |E| can range from 0 to 30,000 and there can be up to 100,000 queries consisting of pairs of nodes (u, v) where 0 <= u, v < |V|.
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `frm` and `to`, which are lists of edges represented as tuples in a directed graph. It adds directed edges from nodes in `frm` to nodes in `to` and also tracks the reverse edges. However, it does not return any value, nor does it handle cases where the inputs are empty or contain invalid edges.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node in the directed graph; used is a set of integers representing the nodes already visited; back_track is a boolean indicating whether to backtrack in the graph traversal.
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is an integer representing the current node, `used` is a set of integers representing all the nodes that have been visited during the traversal, `back_track` remains unchanged, and `g[now]` may be empty or contain nodes not in `used`.
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a directed graph, a set `used` of integers representing the nodes that have already been visited, and a boolean `back_track` which indicates whether to backtrack in the graph traversal. The function performs a depth-first traversal of the graph, marking nodes as visited, and appending the current node to the `back_track` list after exploring all its neighbors. However, the function does not utilize the `back_track` boolean for any condition, and it does not handle cases where there are cycles in the graph, which could lead to infinite recursion. Additionally, it assumes the existence of a global variable `g` representing the graph structure, which is not defined within the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node, num_cmp is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, used is a list of boolean values indicating whether each node has been visited, and cmp is a list of integers representing the component assignment for each node.
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is an integer representing the current node, `num_cmp` is the number of strongly connected components, `used` marks all reachable nodes from `now` as visited, `cmp` indicates the strongly connected component number for all reachable nodes from `now`, and `rg[now]` has been fully explored.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now`, an integer `num_cmp`, a list of booleans `used`, and a list of integers `cmp`. It marks the current node `now` as visited, assigns it to the strongly connected component `num_cmp`, and recursively explores all reachable nodes from `now`, marking them as visited and assigning them to the same component. The function effectively implements a depth-first search to identify and label strongly connected components in a directed graph.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000. The graph is defined by a sequence of directed edges, and a series of queries, each containing a pair of nodes (u, v) where 0 ≤ u, v < n.
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values indicating which nodes have been processed (True for processed, False for unprocessed), `back_track` is a list that may contain nodes added during the execution of `func_2`, `cmp` is a list of size `n` potentially modified by `func_2`, and `v` is `n - 1` (the last index checked in the loop).
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `used` is a list of `n` boolean values with some set to `True`, `back_track` is unchanged, `cmp` is unchanged, `num_cmp` is the count of how many times `func_3` was called, and `v` is the last value iterated over from `back_track`.
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the count of how many times 'func_3' was called as num_cmp and the current value of cmp
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the graph by calling two other functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) to identify strongly connected components. It returns `num_cmp`, the count of how many times `func_3` was called, and `cmp`, a list that represents the component to which each node belongs. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
