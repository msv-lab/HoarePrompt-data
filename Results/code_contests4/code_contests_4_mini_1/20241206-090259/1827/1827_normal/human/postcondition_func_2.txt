The function accepts an integer `now`, an integer `num_cmp`, a list of booleans `used`, and a list of integers `cmp`. It marks the current node `now` as visited, assigns it to the strongly connected component `num_cmp`, and recursively explores all reachable nodes from `now`, marking them as visited and assigning them to the same component. The function effectively implements a depth-first search to identify and label strongly connected components in a directed graph.
