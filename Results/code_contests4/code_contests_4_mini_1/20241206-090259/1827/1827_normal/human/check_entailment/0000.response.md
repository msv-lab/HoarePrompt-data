To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the functions and their output descriptions in relation to the problem statement regarding strongly connected components in a directed graph.

### Function Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(frm, to)`**: 
   - It adds directed edges to the graph and tracks reverse edges.
   - **Issue**: The function does not handle cases where inputs are empty or invalid edges. If either `frm` or `to` has invalid nodes (e.g., nodes that don't exist in the graph), this function could lead to incorrect behavior.

2. **Function `func_2(now, used, back_track)`**: 
   - This function performs a depth-first traversal of the graph.
   - **Issues**: 
     - It does not use the `back_track` boolean for any condition, making it redundant.
     - It does not handle cycles in the graph, which could lead to infinite recursion if the traversal encounters a cycle.

3. **Function `func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp)`**: 
   - This function effectively identifies and labels nodes in strongly connected components.
   - **Correctness**: This function seems to work as required by the problem description.

4. **Function `func_4(n)`**: 
   - It processes the graph and identifies strongly connected components.
   - **Issues**:
     - It does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
     - If `n` is 0, the graph would not have any nodes, and the function would not be able to process any edges or queries correctly.

### Output Hints Analysis

The output hints provided for each function offer some insights but also reveal potential shortcomings:

- For **func_1**, it correctly states that the function does not return any value and fails to handle empty or invalid edges.
- For **func_2**, it rightly points out the lack of handling for cycles, leading to the potential for infinite recursion.
- For **func_4**, it mentions that it does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which would break the expected functionality.

### Conclusion

Given that the program does not account for edge cases, particularly:
- The handling of empty or invalid edges in `func_1`.
- The lack of cycle detection in `func_2`, which can lead to infinite recursion.
- The lack of handling for a graph with no nodes in `func_4`.

Since these issues could lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case. 

Therefore, the conclusion regarding the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases such as empty graphs, invalid edges, and cycles, which could lead to incorrect behavior or infinite loops.
