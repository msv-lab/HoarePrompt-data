frm is a list of tuples representing directed edges in a graph, where each tuple contains two integers (source, target) with 0 <= source, target < |V|; to is a list of tuples representing queries, where each tuple contains two integers (u, v) with 0 <= u, v < |V|. |V| is the number of nodes in the graph and is between 1 and 10,000; |E|, the number of edges, is between 0 and 30,000; and the number of queries Q is between 1 and 100,000.
