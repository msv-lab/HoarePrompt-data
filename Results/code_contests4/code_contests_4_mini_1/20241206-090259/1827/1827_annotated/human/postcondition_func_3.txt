The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the graph using two helper functions, `func_2` and `func_3`, to identify strongly connected components. It returns the total count of these components (`num_cmp`) and a modified list (`cmp`) that indicates the component each node belongs to. The function does not handle the edges or queries directly, as these are not passed as parameters nor processed within the function.
