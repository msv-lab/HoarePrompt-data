Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, followed by a list of edges defined by pairs of integers (source, target) where each integer is in the range 0 to n-1, and a sequence of queries defined by pairs of integers (u, v) where each integer is also in the range 0 to n-1. The total number of edges does not exceed 30,000 and the number of queries does not exceed 100,000.**
