The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a directed graph, an integer `num_cmp` indicating the number of strongly connected components, a list `used` to track which nodes have been visited, and a list `cmp` that assigns each node to its corresponding strongly connected component. It performs a depth-first search to mark the current node and all reachable nodes as visited and assigns them to the same strongly connected component. The function does not return a value.
