According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `used` is a list initialized with all values set to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, and `cmp` is a list initialized with all values set to `-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` must start at 0, which is the first iteration index.

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, and `v` is 0**
