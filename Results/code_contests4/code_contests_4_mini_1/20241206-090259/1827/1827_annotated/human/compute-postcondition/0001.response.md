The variable `back_track` is initialized as an empty list. The list `used` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list.

Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list**
