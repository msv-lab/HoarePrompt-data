According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and the length of the list `used`, which is `n`. If `v` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`, `v` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be incremented by 1, making `v` equal to 2. Additionally, since `n` is greater than 0, `v` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, `n` is greater than 2, and `v` is 2**
