According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and the length of `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `v` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0, and given that `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again for the next value of `v`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `v` will be 1. The list `used` remains unchanged as its length is still `n` and all values are still set to `False`. 

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `v` is 1**
