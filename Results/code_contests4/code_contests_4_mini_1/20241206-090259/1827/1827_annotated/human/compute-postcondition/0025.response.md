According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `back_track` in reverse order. The loop can execute again if there are still elements left in `back_track` to process. At the end of the last iteration, `used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True` for the processed elements. If `used[v]` is `True`, it indicates that the element at index `v` in `used` has already been processed, and no changes are made to `num_cmp`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the following:
- The loop variable `v` needs to take on the next element from the reversed `back_track`.
- For the loop to execute again, there must still be elements left in `back_track` that have not been processed.

Assuming `back_track` contained elements to process and that we have processed one of them, we can conclude:
- If `used[v]` was `True` for the last processed element, then the next element in the reverse order will be processed next.

Therefore, if `v` was the last index processed, we increment `v` to refer to the next element in the reverse order of `back_track`.

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True` for the processed elements, for the loop to execute one more time `back_track` must have additional elements to process, and `v` is the next index to be processed in reverse order from `back_track`.**
