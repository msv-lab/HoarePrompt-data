Postcondition: ***`used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `v` is 1. If `used[v]` is `False`, the function `func_2(v, used, back_track)` is called.***
