Postcondition: ***`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True` for the processed elements. If `v` is the next index to be processed in reverse order from `back_track` and `used[v]` is `False`, then `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the condition of the if statement does not hold, and no changes occur to `num_cmp`.***
