The code assigns a new list to the variable `used`, where every element is set to `False`. This means that the previous list of length `n` with all values set to `True` will be replaced by a new list of length `n` with all values set to `False`. The values of `back_track` and `cmp` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, `back_track` is modified by `func_2`, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, and `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, `back_track` is modified by `func_2`, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
