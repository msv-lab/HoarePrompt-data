Postcondition: ***`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True` for the processed element. If the element at index `v` in `used` is not processed, then `num_cmp` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, if `used[v]` is `True`, the condition does not hold, and no changes are made to `num_cmp`.***
