The value of `num_cmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_cmp` is 0, so after execution, `num_cmp` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`; `back_track` has at least 1 element; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`; `n` is greater than 0; `num_cmp` is 1; `v` is the last element of `back_track`; `used[v]` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`; `back_track` has at least 1 element; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`; `n` is greater than 0; `num_cmp` is 1; `v` is the last element of `back_track`; `used[v]` is set to `True`.**
