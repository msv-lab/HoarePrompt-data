The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: a non-negative integer `n`, a list of edges defined by pairs of integers (source, target), and a sequence of queries defined by pairs of integers (u, v). The integer `n` represents the number of nodes in a directed graph, while the edges and queries consist of integers in the range from 0 to n-1. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: the total count of processed elements `num_cmp` and a modified list `cmp` with length `n` for the processed elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a list of edges, and a sequence of queries, and to return the count of processed elements along with a modified list of those elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n, a list of edges, and a sequence of queries. It returns the total count of processed elements num_cmp and a modified list cmp with length n for the processed elements.**
