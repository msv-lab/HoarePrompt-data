The loop iterates over each index `v` from `0` to `n-1`. If `used[v]` is `False`, the function `func_2` is called, which likely modifies the `used` list and possibly the `back_track` list as well. Since the initial state of `used` is all `False`, the function `func_2` will be invoked for each index from `0` to `n-1`, assuming `n` is greater than `0`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can deduce the following:

- The `used` list will be updated such that all indices from `0` to `n-1` are set to `True` (assuming `func_2` marks them as used).
- The `back_track` list will potentially contain values modified by `func_2`, but without specific information about what `func_2` does, we cannot determine its exact content.
- The `cmp` list remains unchanged since it is initialized to `-1` for all indices and there's no indication that it gets modified within the loop.

Therefore, we can summarize the final output state as follows:

Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True`, `back_track` is modified by `func_2`, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
