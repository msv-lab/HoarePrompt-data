The variable `cmp` is assigned the value of a list that contains `-1` repeated `n` times. Since `n` determines the length of the list, `cmp` will have `n` elements, all set to `-1`. The other variables, `used` and `back_track`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`.

Output State: **`used` is a list of length `n` initialized with all values set to `False`; `back_track` is an empty list; `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`**.
