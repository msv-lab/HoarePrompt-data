According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `back_track` list. The loop iterates over `back_track` in reverse order (`back_track[::-1]`). For the loop to execute at least once, `back_track` must have at least one element. Since `n` is greater than 0, it implies that `back_track` should contain values corresponding to the length `n`. 

Assuming `back_track` is a list derived from other program states, I cannot confirm its contents without more information. However, for the loop to execute, `back_track` must not be empty.

At the start of the loop, the first value `v` will be the last element of `back_track`, and the loop counter (if applicable) would need to begin from `0` or the index of that last element. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `back_track` has at least one element, and we can initialize `v` to the last element of `back_track`.

State: **`used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `False`, `back_track` has at least 1 element, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cmp` is initialized to 0, `v` is the last element of `back_track`**
