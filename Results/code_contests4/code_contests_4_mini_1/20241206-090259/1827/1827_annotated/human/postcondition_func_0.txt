The function accepts a list of tuples `frm` representing directed edges in a graph and a list of tuples `to` representing queries. However, based on the provided code snippet, it does not return anything or indicate whether a path exists for each query from node `u` to node `v`. The implementation appears incomplete as it only adds edges to a graph structure without processing the queries or checking for paths.
