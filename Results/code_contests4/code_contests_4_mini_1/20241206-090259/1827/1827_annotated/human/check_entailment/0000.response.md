Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully implement the functionality required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to process the queries that check whether two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC). 

The annotations for each function indicate that while the functions are involved in creating a representation of the graph and identifying strongly connected components, they do not connect to the actual query processing. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` do not include any logic to handle the queries provided in the input nor the output required for each query.

For example, the problem description specifies that for each query (u, v), the program should print "1" if u and v belong to the same SCC, and "0" otherwise. However, in the provided code, there is no function that takes the queries and checks the SCCs to produce the required output. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description completely, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
