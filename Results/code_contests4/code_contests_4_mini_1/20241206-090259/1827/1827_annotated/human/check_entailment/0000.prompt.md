You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: frm is a list of tuples representing directed edges in a graph, where each tuple contains two integers (source, target) with 0 <= source, target < |V|; to is a list of tuples representing queries, where each tuple contains two integers (u, v) with 0 <= u, v < |V|. |V| is the number of nodes in the graph and is between 1 and 10,000; |E|, the number of edges, is between 0 and 30,000; and the number of queries Q is between 1 and 100,000.
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `frm` representing directed edges in a graph and a list of tuples `to` representing queries. However, based on the provided code snippet, it does not return anything or indicate whether a path exists for each query from node `u` to node `v`. The implementation appears incomplete as it only adds edges to a graph structure without processing the queries or checking for paths.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node in the directed graph, used is a set of integers representing nodes that have been visited, and back_track is a boolean indicating whether to backtrack in the search process.
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is an integer, `used` is a set of integers with `used[now]` set to True, and `g[now]` contains all neighbors of `now`, each neighbor that has not been visited is marked as used after invoking `func_2` on it.
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a directed graph, a set `used` for tracking which nodes have been visited, and a boolean `back_track` that appears to indicate whether to backtrack in the search process. The function marks the current node as visited, recursively visits all unvisited neighbors of the current node, and appends the current node to the `back_track` list. However, it does not actually use the `back_track` argument as a boolean to influence the traversal, and it does not perform any actions related to backtracking. The function primarily facilitates a depth-first traversal of the directed graph.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: now is an integer representing the current node in the directed graph, num_cmp is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, used is a list of booleans indicating whether each node has been visited, and cmp is a list of integers where each index corresponds to a node and the value at that index indicates the strongly connected component it belongs to.
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `now` is an integer representing the current node, `num_cmp` is an integer representing the number of strongly connected components, `used` is a list of booleans with `used[now]` set to True and `used[nx]` set to True for all nodes `nx` reachable from `now`, `cmp[now]` is equal to `num_cmp`, and `rg[now]` is a list of nodes that have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `now` representing the current node in a directed graph, an integer `num_cmp` indicating the number of strongly connected components, a list `used` to track which nodes have been visited, and a list `cmp` that assigns each node to its corresponding strongly connected component. It performs a depth-first search to mark the current node and all reachable nodes as visited and assigns them to the same strongly connected component. The function does not return a value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in a directed graph, followed by a list of edges defined by pairs of integers (source, target) where each integer is in the range 0 to n-1, and a sequence of queries defined by pairs of integers (u, v) where each integer is also in the range 0 to n-1. The total number of edges does not exceed 30,000 and the number of queries does not exceed 100,000.
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `True`, `back_track` is modified by `func_2`, `cmp` is a list of length `n` with all values set to `-1`, and `n` is greater than 0.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used` is a list of length `n` with `True` for all elements that were processed, `cmp` is a list of length `n` modified by `func_3` for the processed elements, `n` is greater than 0, and `num_cmp` is the total count of processed elements.
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the total count of processed elements 'num_cmp' and the modified list 'cmp' with length 'n' for the processed elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed graph. It processes the graph using two helper functions, `func_2` and `func_3`, to identify strongly connected components. It returns the total count of these components (`num_cmp`) and a modified list (`cmp`) that indicates the component each node belongs to. The function does not handle the edges or queries directly, as these are not passed as parameters nor processed within the function.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
