Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a bug that can lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the input graph will always have valid edges according to the given constraints. However, it does not handle cases where:

1. The graph is empty (i.e., `|V| = 0`).
2. The graph has nodes but no edges (i.e., `|E| = 0`).
3. Queries are made for nodes that do not exist (e.g., `u` or `v` is greater than or equal to `|V|`).

For example, consider the case:
```
Input:
0 0
1
0 0
```
In this case, there are no nodes and thus no edges. The query `0 0` should be invalid since the nodes do not exist. The program does not check for the validity of node indices in the queries, which will raise an index error or produce incorrect results.

Thus, the failure to handle these cases means the program is not robust, and it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is deemed **False**.
