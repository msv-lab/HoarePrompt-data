t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of n lines of strings, each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X', with the constraint that not all cells are empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
