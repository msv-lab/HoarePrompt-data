#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300 for each test case, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X'. The total number of rows across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value from user input, which is within the specified range of 1 to 100 for t and 1 to 300 for n, depending on the input provided
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value from user input. The returned value represents the variable `t`, which should be between 1 and 100, but the input does not validate this range. Therefore, it may return any integer input without ensuring it falls within the specified bounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300 for each test case, and the grid consists of n strings of length n where each character is either '.', or 'X'. The total number of cells across all test cases is guaranteed to be non-empty and does not exceed 300.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input, with each integer representing a value read from the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and returns a list of integers parsed from the input. It assumes that the input will always be well-formed and consist of integers separated by spaces. If the input is empty or not formatted correctly, the behavior is not defined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of n lines of strings, each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X', with the constraint that not all cells are empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of string 's' except the last character. The string 's' consists of 'n' characters that are either '.' or 'X'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and reads a string `s` from input, returning a list of all characters in `s` except the last character. This means if the input string is empty or consists of only one character, it will return an empty list. Additionally, the function does not validate the input to ensure it consists solely of characters '.' and 'X', which may lead to unexpected results if other characters are present.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, followed by n strings of length n containing either the character '.' for empty cells or 'X' for cells containing tokens. It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty and that the character 'O' does not appear in the input. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns all but the last character of the string `s`, which represents the input consisting of a size integer `n` followed by `n` strings of length `n` containing either '.' or 'X'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string input `s`, which contains a size integer `n` followed by `n` strings of length `n` representing a Tic-Tac-Toe grid with tokens 'X' and empty cells '.'. It returns all but the last character of the string `s`, effectively excluding the final newline character typically included in input. The function does not process the actual grid or validate the contents beyond returning the substring, which may lead to incomplete handling of the input data.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid; the grid consists of n strings each of length n, containing characters '.' or 'X', and it is guaranteed that not all cells are empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` indicating the size of a grid made up of `n` strings, each containing characters '.' or 'X'. It counts the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the grid and classifies the positions of 'X' based on the sum of their indices modulo 3. The function then attempts to replace certain 'X' characters with 'O's based on specific conditions and finally prints the modified grid. The output is a modified grid for each test case, but the logic may lead to cases where not all 'X' are replaced if none meet the criteria set by `use_clr`.
