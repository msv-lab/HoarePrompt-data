The function accepts a string input `s`, which contains a size integer `n` followed by `n` strings of length `n` representing a Tic-Tac-Toe grid with tokens 'X' and empty cells '.'. It returns all but the last character of the string `s`, effectively excluding the final newline character typically included in input. The function does not process the actual grid or validate the contents beyond returning the substring, which may lead to incomplete handling of the input data.
