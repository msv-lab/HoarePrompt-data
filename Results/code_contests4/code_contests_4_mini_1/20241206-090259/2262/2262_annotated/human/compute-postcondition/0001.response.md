The code initializes `M` as an empty list. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `n` is a positive integer resulting from `func_1()` (1 ≤ n ≤ 300); `M` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `n` is a positive integer resulting from `func_1()` (1 ≤ n ≤ 300); `M` is an empty list**.
