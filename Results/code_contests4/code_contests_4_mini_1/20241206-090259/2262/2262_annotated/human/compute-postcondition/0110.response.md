`chg` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2, so after execution, `chg` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `M[1][1]` is 'O', `M[1][2]` is 'O', `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `cnt[use_clr]` is 0, `clr` contains values based on the condition of `M`, `chg` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `M[1][1]` is 'O', `M[1][2]` is 'O', `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `cnt[use_clr]` is 0, `clr` contains values based on the condition of `M`, `chg` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
