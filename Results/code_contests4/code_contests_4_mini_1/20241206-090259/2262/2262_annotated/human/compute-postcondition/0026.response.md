The code `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the value at the index `(i + j) % 3` of the list or array `cnt` by 1. The values of `i` and `j` are used to compute the index, and since `j` has been incremented to the next value (current value + 1), we can determine the new value of `j` but not the current value of `i`. The value of `cnt` at index `(i + j) % 3` will be increased by 1. 

Since `t` and `n` remain unchanged and not directly affected by this operation, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and the change made to the `cnt` array.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is incremented to the next value (current value + 1), and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
