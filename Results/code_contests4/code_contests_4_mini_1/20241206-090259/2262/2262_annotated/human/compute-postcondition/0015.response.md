The variable `cnt` is assigned a list containing three zeros, which initializes it to `[0, 0, 0]`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `M`, `k`, `K`, and `clr` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `clr` is an empty dictionary {}, and `cnt` is [0, 0, 0].

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `clr` is an empty dictionary {}, `cnt` is [0, 0, 0]**
