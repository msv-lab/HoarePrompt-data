According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and `n`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**.
