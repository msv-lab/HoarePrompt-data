Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `clr` is updated with `clr[i, j] = (i + j) % 3` if `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X', and `cnt` is updated to include `cnt[(i + 0) % 3] += 1`. If `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1 while keeping other variables as previously defined.***
