According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `M[i]` is the second row of the matrix `M`, which means `i` is 1 (since indexing typically starts at 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `i+1`, which is 2. After the current iteration, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will be 2.

State: **`M[i]` is the second row of the matrix `M`, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be 2**
