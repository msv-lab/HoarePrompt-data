Postcondition: ***`use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `M[0][1]` is 'O', `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `cnt[use_clr]` is 0, `clr` contains values based on the condition of `M`, `chg` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, if `clr[i, j]` matches `use_clr`, then `M[0][2]` is updated to 'O'.***
