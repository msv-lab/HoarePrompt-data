The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1**.
