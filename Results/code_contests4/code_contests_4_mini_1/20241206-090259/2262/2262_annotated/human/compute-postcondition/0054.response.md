According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` is currently less than `n` since `n` is greater than `t + 1` and `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently `k` (where `k` is less than `n-1`), the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be `k + 1`, which is less than `n`.
- The `clr[i, j]` assignment will depend on the values of `M[k + 1][j]` for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure:
- `i` is now `k + 1` (let's denote `i` as `i + 1`).
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**
