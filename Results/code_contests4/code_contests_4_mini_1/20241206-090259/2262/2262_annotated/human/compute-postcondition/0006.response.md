According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the loop variable, which is represented by `_`, is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and the current value of `_` is equal to the number of iterations already completed, which is less than `n`. 

To execute one more time, the value of `_` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the next iteration, `_` will be equal to the number of iterations already completed plus 1. 

Since `n` is greater than the current value of `_`, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n`, which remains valid. 

Thus, after the current iteration, `_` will be increased by 1, but `n` will remain unchanged. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing the result of `func_3()`, `k` is the previous value of `k` plus the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute one more time `_` must be less than `n` and `_` will be incremented by 1.**
