According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `n` times, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once. The variable `k` is currently set to 0, and it will not affect the execution of the loop itself but may be relevant for the loop body. The variable `M` is an empty list, which also does not affect the loop execution but may be utilized within the loop body.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `_` is not used, but it will take on the values from 0 to `n-1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer resulting from `func_1()` and must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty list, `k` is 0**
