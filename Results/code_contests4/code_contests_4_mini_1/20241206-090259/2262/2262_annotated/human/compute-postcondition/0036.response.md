According to the code, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that `n` is greater than 0, which is already satisfied since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. The loop will also execute a total of `n` times. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`. Given that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), this means `n` must be greater than `t + 1` (which is at least 3 when `t` is 1). 

Thus, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute the first time are already met with `t` being a positive integer and `n` being greater than `t + 1`.

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than `t + 1`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
