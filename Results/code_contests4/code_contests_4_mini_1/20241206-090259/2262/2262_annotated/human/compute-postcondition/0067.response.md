According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, which allows for further execution. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 3 to allow for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3**
