The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`use_clr`, `t`, `n`, and `M[i][j]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 2, `M[i][j]` is 'O' for all `j` where `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, and `chg` is increased by 1.
