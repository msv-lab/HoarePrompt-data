According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented to the next value (current value + 1). Given that `j` is now set to its next value, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

Since `j` has been incremented, if it was `j` at the end of the last iteration, it is now `j + 1`. Therefore, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is the current value + 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.**
