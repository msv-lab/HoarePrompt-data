The variable `k` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `M`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `n` is a positive integer resulting from `func_1()` (1 ≤ n ≤ 300); `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `n` is a positive integer resulting from `func_1()` (1 ≤ n ≤ 300); `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0**
