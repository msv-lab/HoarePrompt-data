According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` has been incremented by 1, which means it is now equal to its previous value plus 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `_`. 

Given that `_` has been incremented by 1, we set `_` to its new value (which is the previous value plus 1). Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than this incremented `_`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing the previous results along with a new result from `func_3()`, `k` is the new value after incrementing by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, `_` is the incremented value, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `_`**
