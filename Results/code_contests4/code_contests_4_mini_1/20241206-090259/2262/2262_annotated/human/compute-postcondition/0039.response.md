The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` is not specified in the initial state, but we know `j` is 0. Therefore, `(i + j) % 3` simplifies to `i % 3`. The count in the `cnt` array at index `i % 3` is increased by 1.

Since `cnt[i % 3]` is affected based on the value of `i`, and we do not have a specific value for `i`, we can summarize the output state by stating that the count at the index corresponding to `i % 3` has increased.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than `t + 1`, `j` is 0, `clr[i, j]` is equal to `i % 3, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
