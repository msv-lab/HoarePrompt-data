The variable `cnt` at index `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` affect this assignment. Since `j` is defined as the current value + 1, it is known that it will be a positive integer greater than 1. The operation `(i + j) % 3` will yield a result that can be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the specific values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, the value of `cnt` at the computed index is increased by 1. 

The output state reflects that the count at the specific index has been updated but does not specify the exact previous value of `cnt` or the specific index.

Output State: **`cnt` at index `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 1**
