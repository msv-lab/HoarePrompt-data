According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than `k + 1`, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than `k + 1`, which implies that `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, which means `j` will become 2.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
