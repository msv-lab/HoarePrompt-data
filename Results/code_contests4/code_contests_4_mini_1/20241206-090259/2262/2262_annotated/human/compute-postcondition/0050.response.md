The variable `cnt` is an array where the index is determined by the expression `(i + j) % 3`. The value of `j` is 2, so we can rewrite the expression as `(i + 2) % 3`. The result of this expression will determine which index in the `cnt` array will be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it can take any value that would lead to a valid index for the `cnt` array (0, 1, or 2). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `j`, and `clr[i, j]`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `cnt` at index `(i + 2) % 3` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `cnt` at index `(i + 2) % 3` is incremented by 1.**
