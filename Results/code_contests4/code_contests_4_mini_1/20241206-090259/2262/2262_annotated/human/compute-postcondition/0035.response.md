According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `t + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `t + 1`**
