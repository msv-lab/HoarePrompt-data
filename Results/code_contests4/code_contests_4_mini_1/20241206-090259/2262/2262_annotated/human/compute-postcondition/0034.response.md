Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `clr` is updated for all elements `clr[i, j]` where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, being `(i + j) % 3` if `M[i][j]` is 'X', or -1 if `M[i][j]` is not 'X', and `cnt` contains the counts of 'X' based on the indices `(i + j) % 3` for all `j` in the range of `n`.**
