Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `clr` is updated with `clr[i, j] = (i + j) % 3`, `cnt` is [0, 0, 0], `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X'.**
