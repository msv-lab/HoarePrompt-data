The statement `clr[i, j] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element `clr` at the index `[i, j]`. The variable `i` is `k + 1`, and `j` is `1`. Thus, this assignment updates the specific position in the `clr` matrix without affecting the values of `t`, `n`, or `j`. The initial conditions indicate that the element `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X', but this does not directly impact the assignment to `clr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `j` is 1, and `clr[i, j]` is now -1.**
