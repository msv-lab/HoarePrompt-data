The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `i` and `j` are `k + 1` and `2`, respectively. Therefore, the expression `(i + j) % 3` becomes `((k + 1) + 2) % 3`, which simplifies to `(k + 3) % 3`. 

The value of `cnt[(k + 3) % 3]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `cnt[(k + 3) % 3]` is incremented by 1. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `cnt[(k + 3) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
