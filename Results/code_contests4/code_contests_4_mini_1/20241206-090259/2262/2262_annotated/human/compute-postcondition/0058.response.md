The variable `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is `k + 1`, and the value of `j` is 1. Therefore, the calculation for the index becomes `(i + j) % 3 = (k + 1 + 1) % 3 = (k + 2) % 3`. The previous value of `cnt[(k + 2) % 3]` is unknown, so it simply increases by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `j` is 1, element at position `M[i][j]` is 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `(k + 2) % 3`, and `cnt[(k + 2) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
