The value of `n` is assigned the result of `func_1()`. The previous state indicates that `n` is a positive integer that represents the size of the grid for the current test case. The exact value of `n` is determined by the function `func_1()`, which is not provided, but it is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the limits mentioned (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `n` without specifying its exact value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `n` is a positive integer resulting from `func_1()` (1 ≤ n ≤ 300)**
