According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and since `n` is greater than `t + 1`, it can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
