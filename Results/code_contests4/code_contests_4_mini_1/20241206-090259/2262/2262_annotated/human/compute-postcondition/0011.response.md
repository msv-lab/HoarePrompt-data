In the given code, `k` is updated by adding the count of 'X' and 'O' characters found in the last element of the list `M`. The last element of `M` is the result of the `func_3()` function that was appended, and `sum([(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])` counts how many times 'X' or 'O' are present in that last element.

Thus, if `M[-1]` contains a certain number of 'X' and 'O' characters, `k` will be incremented by that count. Other variables remain unchanged.

The output state includes the updated value of `k` along with the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, `M`, and `_`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing the previous results along with a new result from `func_3()`, `k` is the new value after incrementing by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, `_` is the incremented value.**
