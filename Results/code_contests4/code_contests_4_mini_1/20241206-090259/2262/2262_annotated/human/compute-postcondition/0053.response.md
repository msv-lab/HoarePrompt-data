Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than `t + 1`, `j` is `n-1`. If for all `j` in the range 0 to n-1, `M[i][j]` equals 'X', then `clr[i, j]` is equal to `(i + j) % 3` for each `j`, and `cnt` contains counts of how many times each remainder (0, 1, and 2) occurred based on the indices. If for any `j`, `M[i][j]` is not 'X', then `clr[i, j]` is assigned -1 for that specific `j`.**
