`chg` is assigned the value of 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `cnt[use_clr]` is 0, `clr` contains values based on the condition of `M`, and `chg` is 0.
