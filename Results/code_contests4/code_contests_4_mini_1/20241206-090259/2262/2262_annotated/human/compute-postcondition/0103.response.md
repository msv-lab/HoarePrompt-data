Postcondition: ***`use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `M[i][j]` is 'O' for all `j` where `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `cnt[use_clr]` is 0, `clr` contains values based on the condition of `M`, `chg` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and if `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, then `chg` is set to 1 and `M[1][0]` is 'O'.***
