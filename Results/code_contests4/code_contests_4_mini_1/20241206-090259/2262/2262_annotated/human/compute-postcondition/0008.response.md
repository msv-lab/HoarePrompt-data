The value of `k` is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of the list `M`. The expression `sum([(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])` counts how many times 'X' and 'O' appear in `M[-1]`, and that count is added to the previous value of `k`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `_` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `M` is a list containing the previous results along with a new result from `func_3()`, `k` is the new value after incrementing by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, `_` is incremented by 1.**
