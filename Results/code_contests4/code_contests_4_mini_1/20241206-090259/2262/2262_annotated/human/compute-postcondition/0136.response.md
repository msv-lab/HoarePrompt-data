The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, constrained between 1 and 100. For each test case, there is an integer `n`, which is also a positive integer representing the size of the grid, constrained between 1 and 300. The grid consists of `n` strings, each of length `n`, containing characters '.' or 'X', and it is guaranteed that not all cells are empty. 

Since the output details are not specified in the prompt, we will focus on the inputs.
