Postcondition: ***`use_clr` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1, `M[0][1]` is 'O', `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' across all elements of `M`, `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`, `cnt[use_clr]` is 0, `clr` contains values based on the condition of `M`, `chg` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr` when `clr[i, j]` matches `use_clr` in the first execution of the loop. If `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, then `chg` is set to 2 and `clr[i, j]` remains equal to `use_clr`.***
