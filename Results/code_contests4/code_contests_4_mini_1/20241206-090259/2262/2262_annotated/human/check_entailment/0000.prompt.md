You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type O do not appear in the input of the easy version.

Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.

In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are n rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: X and O. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.

<image> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations. The patterns in the second row are draw configurations. 

In an operation, you can change an X to an O, or an O to an X. Let k denote the total number of tokens in the grid. Your task is to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ (rounding down) operations.

You are not required to minimize the number of operations.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) — the size of the grid.

The following n lines each contain a string of n characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the i-th row and j-th column is '.' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: 'X' or 'O'.

It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.

In the easy version, the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

Output

For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.

We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

In the first test case, there are initially three 'X' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to 'O' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed 1≤ ⌊ 5/3⌋ token.

In the second test case, we change only 9≤ ⌊ 32/3⌋ tokens, and there does not exist any three 'X' or 'O' consecutive in a row or column, so it is a draw.

In the third test case, we change only 3≤ ⌊ 12/3⌋ tokens, and the resulting grid is a draw.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300 for each test case, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X'. The total number of rows across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value from user input, which is within the specified range of 1 to 100 for t and 1 to 300 for n, depending on the input provided
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value from user input. The returned value represents the variable `t`, which should be between 1 and 100, but the input does not validate this range. Therefore, it may return any integer input without ensuring it falls within the specified bounds.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300 for each test case, and the grid consists of n strings of length n where each character is either '.', or 'X'. The total number of cells across all test cases is guaranteed to be non-empty and does not exceed 300.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input, with each integer representing a value read from the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and returns a list of integers parsed from the input. It assumes that the input will always be well-formed and consist of integers separated by spaces. If the input is empty or not formatted correctly, the behavior is not defined.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of n lines of strings, each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X', with the constraint that not all cells are empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of string 's' except the last character. The string 's' consists of 'n' characters that are either '.' or 'X'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and reads a string `s` from input, returning a list of all characters in `s` except the last character. This means if the input string is empty or consists of only one character, it will return an empty list. Additionally, the function does not validate the input to ensure it consists solely of characters '.' and 'X', which may lead to unexpected results if other characters are present.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, followed by n strings of length n containing either the character '.' for empty cells or 'X' for cells containing tokens. It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty and that the character 'O' does not appear in the input. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns all but the last character of the string `s`, which represents the input consisting of a size integer `n` followed by `n` strings of length `n` containing either '.' or 'X'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string input `s`, which contains a size integer `n` followed by `n` strings of length `n` representing a Tic-Tac-Toe grid with tokens 'X' and empty cells '.'. It returns all but the last character of the string `s`, effectively excluding the final newline character typically included in input. The function does not process the actual grid or validate the contents beyond returning the substring, which may lead to incomplete handling of the input data.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid; the grid consists of n strings each of length n, containing characters '.' or 'X', and it is guaranteed that not all cells are empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` indicating the size of a grid made up of `n` strings, each containing characters '.' or 'X'. It counts the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the grid and classifies the positions of 'X' based on the sum of their indices modulo 3. The function then attempts to replace certain 'X' characters with 'O's based on specific conditions and finally prints the modified grid. The output is a modified grid for each test case, but the logic may lead to cases where not all 'X' are replaced if none meet the criteria set by `use_clr`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
