Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the requirement to ensure that there are no three consecutive tokens of the same type in any row or column after performing the allowed operations. 

One potential case where the program fails is when the input grid has a scenario like the following:

```
3
XXX
...
XX.
```

In this example, the initial grid has three 'X' tokens in the first row, which already satisfies a winning condition. The program attempts to change tokens to 'O' but does not ensure that no three consecutive 'X' or 'O' tokens exist after the replacements. 

After performing the operations, the output might still contain three 'X' tokens in the first row, making it a winning configuration instead of a draw configuration, which violates the problem requirements. 

Therefore, since there exists at least one input where the program does not achieve the desired outcome, the correctness is deemed false.
