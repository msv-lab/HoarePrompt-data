t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. The grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters where each character is either '.' or 'X'. It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty and the character 'O' does not appear in the input. The total number of characters across all test cases does not exceed 300.
