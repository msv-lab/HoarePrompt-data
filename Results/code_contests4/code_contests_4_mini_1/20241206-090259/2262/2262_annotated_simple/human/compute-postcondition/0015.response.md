`cnt` is initialized as a list containing three zeros, resulting from the expression `[0] * 3`. The other variables remain unaffected as they are not involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`; `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `K` is the integer result of `k / 3.0; clr` is an empty dictionary; `cnt` is [0, 0, 0].

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`; `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `K` is the integer result of `k / 3.0; clr` is an empty dictionary; `cnt` is [0, 0, 0]**
