Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `j` is equal to `n`, and `chg` is the count of how many times `clr[i, j]` was equal to `use_clr` during the iterations. `M[i][j]` is set to 'O' for each corresponding `j` where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`.**
