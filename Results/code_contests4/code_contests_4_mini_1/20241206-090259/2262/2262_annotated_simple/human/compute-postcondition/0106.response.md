`chg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `chg` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact new value. However, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `j` is 5, `M[4][5]` is 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.
