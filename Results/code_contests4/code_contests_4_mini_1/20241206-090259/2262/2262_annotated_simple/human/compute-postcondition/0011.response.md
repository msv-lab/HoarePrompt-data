The code snippet increments the variable `k` by the total count of 'X' and 'O' characters in the last element of the list `M`. The list comprehension `[(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO']` generates a list of 1's for each occurrence of 'X' or 'O' in `M[-1]`, and `sum()` calculates the total number of these occurrences. 

Since `k` is updated based on the previous value, we can say:
- The previous value of `k` is known (as an integer).
- The value of `M[-1]` contains the previous result that is being examined for 'X' and 'O'.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `k`, indicating it has been increased by the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `M` is a list containing the previous results, `k` is now the updated count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1] after incrementing by the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`, and the function `func_3()` is called to append a new result to `M`.**
