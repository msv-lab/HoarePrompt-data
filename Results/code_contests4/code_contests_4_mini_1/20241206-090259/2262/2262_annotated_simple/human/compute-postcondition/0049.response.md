The value of `clr[i, j]` is assigned the result of the expression `(i + j) % 3`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` and `j`, where `j` is 3. The output of the expression `(i + 3) % 3` will depend on the specific value of `i`. However, since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only state that `clr[i, j]` will hold a value determined by this expression. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, `j` is 3, `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X', and `clr[i, j]` is assigned `(i + 3) % 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, `j` is 3, `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X', and `clr[i, j]` is assigned `(i + 3) % 3`.**
