The statement `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the value at the index `(i + j) % 3` of the list or array `cnt` by 1. The previous values of `cnt` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify exact values for it. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged by this operation, as only `cnt` is modified.

Since `j` is already incremented by 1 and `i` has its own value, we can determine that the index for the increment operation is calculated based on the current values of `i` and `j`. However, without specific values for `i` and `cnt`, we can only specify that one of the elements of `cnt` is increased.

Therefore, the output state reflects that a value in `cnt` has been incremented based on the computed index.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1**.
