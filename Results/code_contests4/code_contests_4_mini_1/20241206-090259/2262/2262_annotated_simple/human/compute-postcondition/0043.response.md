According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `j` will be 2). 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, `j` is 2, and the element `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X'.**
