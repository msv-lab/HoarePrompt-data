According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `M[i]` contains joined elements that are 'O', indicating that the loop has processed the `i`-th iteration. Since `i` would be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, we can deduce that the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, we have:

State: **`M[i]` contains joined elements that are 'O', for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
