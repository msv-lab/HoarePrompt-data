According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1. Given that `n` is greater than `k + 1`, it implies that `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute once more.

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `j` as `j + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than `n`, which means that `j` must be less than `n - 1`.

Thus, if `j` is incremented by 1, the new value for `j` is `j + 1`. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n - 1**
