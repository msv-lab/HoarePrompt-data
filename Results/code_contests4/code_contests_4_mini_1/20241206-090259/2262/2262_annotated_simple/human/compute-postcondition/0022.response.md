The statement `clr[i, j] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element at the position `[i, j]` in the `clr` array. The previous values of `clr[i, j]` are not explicitly stated, but the assignment indicates that it changes that specific element to `-1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `j`, and `M[i][j]`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is at least 1; `j` is 0; `clr[i, j]` is -1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is at least 1; `j` is 0; `clr[i, j]` is -1**
