The variable `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value of `(i + j) % 3`. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified, but we know that `j` is 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `(i + 0) % 3`, which is `i % 3`. The output state reflects this calculation, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the element at position `M[i][j]` is 'X', and `clr[i, j]` is `i % 3`.**
