According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the variable `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (to allow `j` to reach 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
