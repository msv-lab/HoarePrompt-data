Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `chg` is the total count of all instances where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr` across all iterations, and `M[i][j]` is set to 'O' for each corresponding `(i, j)` where this condition holds true.**
