The statement `M[i][j] = 'O'` assigns the value 'O' to the element in the 2D list `M` at the position specified by the indices `i` and `j`. Given that `i` is 4 and `j` is 5, the value 'O' is placed at `M[4][5]`. The values of `use_clr`, `cnt`, `t`, `n`, and the conditions regarding the loop are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `j` is 5, and `M[4][5]` is 'O'**.
