The variable `chg` is incremented by 1. Since `chg` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by an additional 1, resulting in `chg` being increased by 2 in total. The other variables are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `chg` while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 4, `j` is 6, `M[4][6]` is 'O', `chg` is increased by 2.**
