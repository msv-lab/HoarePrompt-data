The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `j` is 1, `M[5][1]` is 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.
