According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, `j` will become 2. Since `n` remains at least 5, the loop will be able to execute again.

State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `j` is 2**
