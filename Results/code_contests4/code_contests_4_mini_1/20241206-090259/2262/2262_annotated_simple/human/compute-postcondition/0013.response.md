The variable `K` is assigned the value of `int(k / 3.0)`. The value of `k` is known as the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`. Since `k` is an integer, dividing `k` by `3.0` results in a floating-point number, and then applying `int()` will truncate the decimal part, effectively performing a floor division. The values of `t`, `n`, and `M` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`; `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `K` is the integer result of `k / 3.0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`; `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `K` is the integer result of `k / 3.0`.**
