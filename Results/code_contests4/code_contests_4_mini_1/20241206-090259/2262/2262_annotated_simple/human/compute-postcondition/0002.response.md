The variable `k` is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0**.
