According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2, and since `n` is at least 2, the loop can still execute as long as `n` is greater than 2. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
