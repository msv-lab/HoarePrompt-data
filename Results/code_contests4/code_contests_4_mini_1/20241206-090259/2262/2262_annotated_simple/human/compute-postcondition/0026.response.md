The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is known to be 1, but the value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, `(i + j) % 3` can result in different values depending on the unknown value of `i`. The previous values of `cnt` are not specified, but we know that the count at the index determined by `(i + 1) % 3` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
