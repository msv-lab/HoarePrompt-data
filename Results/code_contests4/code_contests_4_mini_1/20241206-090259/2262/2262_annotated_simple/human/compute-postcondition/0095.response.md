The value of `chg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `chg` is unknown. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `j` is now incremented to `j + 1`, and `chg` is increased by 1.
