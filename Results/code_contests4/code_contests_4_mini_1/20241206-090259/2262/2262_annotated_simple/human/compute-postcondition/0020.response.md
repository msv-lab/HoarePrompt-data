The expression `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the count at the index `(i + j) % 3` in the list or array `cnt`. The variables `i` and `j` are involved in the calculation, and since `j` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `cnt[i % 3] += 1`. The value of `cnt[i % 3]` is increased by 1. 

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and `n` is at least 1, these values do not affect the execution of the code in a direct manner. The values of `M[i][j]` and `clr[i, j]` are also not directly relevant to the execution of this specific line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is based on the increment of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` with no changes to the other variables. 

Output State: **`cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the element at position `M[i][j]` is 'X', and `clr[i, j]` is `i % 3`.**
