The statement `M[i][j] = 'O'` assigns the value 'O' to the element at the `i`-th row and `j`-th column of the matrix `M`. The values of `use_clr`, `cnt`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment. The previous values are `i` is 5 and `j` is 0, which means we are modifying the element at `M[5][0]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `j` is 0, and `M[5][0]` is now 'O'.
