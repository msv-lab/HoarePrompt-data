Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, `clr` is a dictionary with keys from (i + 1, j) for `j` in range(n), `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and the element `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X'.***
