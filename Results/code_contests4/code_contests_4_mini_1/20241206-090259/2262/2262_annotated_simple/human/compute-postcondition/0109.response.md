The statement `M[i][j] = 'O'` assigns the value 'O' to the position in the matrix `M` at indices `[i][j]`, where `i` is 4 and `j` is 6. The previous state indicates that `M[4][6]` was already 'O' if `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, and `chg` is increased by 1. However, since no specific value for `clr[i, j]` is given, we can't determine its equality with `use_clr`. 

Since `M[4][6]` is explicitly set to 'O' and this action does not depend on prior values of `M`, the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 4, `j` is 6, `M[4][6]` is 'O', and `chg` is increased by 1.**
