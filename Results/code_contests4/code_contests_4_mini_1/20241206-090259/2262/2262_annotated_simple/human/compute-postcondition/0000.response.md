The variable `n` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1()`. The specific value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, but it is known that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300 for each test case. Other variables in the initial state remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300**
