The code initializes `M` as an empty list. The variables `t` and `n` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the newly created list `M` while keeping the previous values of `t` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300; `M` is an empty list**.
