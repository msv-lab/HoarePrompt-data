According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n` times, and as the loop executes, the loop counter (which is represented by `_` in this case) increments from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `_` would be `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, and at the end of the last iteration `_` is `n - 1`, the next value of `_` would be `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `n`, which is not possible.

Thus, the loop cannot execute again since the termination condition has already been reached.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `M` is a list containing the previous results, `k` is now the updated count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1], for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `n`, which is not possible.**
