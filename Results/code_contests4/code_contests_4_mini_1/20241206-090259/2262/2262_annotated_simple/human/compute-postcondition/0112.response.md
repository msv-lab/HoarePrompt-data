Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `j` is less than `n`, if `clr[4, j]` equals `use_clr`, then `M[4][j]` is 'O' for each `j` where this condition holds true, and `chg` is the total count of such matches.**
