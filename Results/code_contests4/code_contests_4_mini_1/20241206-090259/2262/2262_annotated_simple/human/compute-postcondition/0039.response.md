Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in M[i + 1], `clr` is a dictionary with keys from (i + 1, j) for j in range(n), `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, the element M[i][j] is equal to 'X', and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is increased by 1.**
