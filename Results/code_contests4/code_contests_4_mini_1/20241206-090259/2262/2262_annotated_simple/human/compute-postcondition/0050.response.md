The code snippet `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` updates the `cnt` array based on the calculation `(i + j) % 3`. The previous value of `j` is 3. Therefore, the expression `(i + j) % 3` results in `(i + 3) % 3`. 

Since `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, and no specific values for `i` or the initial state of `cnt` are provided, we cannot determine exact values for `cnt`. However, `cnt` will have one of its elements (the one at the index determined by `(i + 3) % 3`) incremented by 1.

Given that `cnt` is updated but we do not know its previous state, we can conclude that `cnt` will be modified, but we cannot specify the exact values. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, `j` is 3, `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned `(i + 3) % 3`, and `cnt[(i + 3) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
