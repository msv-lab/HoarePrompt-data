The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `clr[i, j]` is `(i + j) % 3`, which determines the index for the `cnt` array that is being updated. Since `cnt` is being updated but its previous value is not specified, the output state indicates the change made to `cnt`. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value of `(i + j) % 3; `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`clr[i, j]` is assigned the value of `(i + j) % 3; `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1**
