Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[k + 1]`, `clr` has keys (k + 1, j) for j in range(n) with values computed as `(k + 1 + j) % 3` for 'X' or -1 otherwise, `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X'.***
