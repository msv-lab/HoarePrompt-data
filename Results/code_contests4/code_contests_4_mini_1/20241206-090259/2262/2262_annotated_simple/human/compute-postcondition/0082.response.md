`chg` is assigned the value 0. The other variables (`use_clr`, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, `cnt[2]`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` must all be less than or equal to K for the loop to terminate, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, and `chg` is 0.
