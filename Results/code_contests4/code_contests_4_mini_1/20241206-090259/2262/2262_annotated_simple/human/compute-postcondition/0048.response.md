According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute once more. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 3, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, `j` is 3, and the element `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X'.**
