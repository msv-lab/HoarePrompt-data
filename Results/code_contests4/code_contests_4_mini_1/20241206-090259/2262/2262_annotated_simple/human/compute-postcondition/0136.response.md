The function `func_5` does not take any parameters. It processes a grid consisting of `n` strings of length `n`, where each character is either '.' or 'X', with the constraints that `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) for each test case. The function returns a value based on the analysis of the grid. 

Since the specifics of the output based on the grid content are not provided, it is assumed that the function will perform some operations on the grid and return a result based on its analysis.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a result based on the analysis of a grid composed of n strings of length n, where each character is either '.' or 'X'.**
