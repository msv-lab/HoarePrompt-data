According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have that `_` is currently less than `n`, since the loop has executed `n` times and `_` is not initialized in a way that allows it to exceed `n` during the loop execution. 

Since the loop is structured to run from 0 to `n-1`, once the loop has executed `n` times, `_` would be equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` would need to be `n`, and `n` must remain within its bounds. 

Thus, after the last iteration, `_` must be incremented to `n`, which allows for the loop to check the condition for a subsequent execution. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `M` is a list containing the result of `func_3()`, `k` is the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1], for the loop to execute a second time `_` must be equal to `n` (which is the condition for exiting the loop)**
