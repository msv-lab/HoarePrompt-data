The variable `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `j`) are not directly affected by this assignment. The conditions provided in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `clr[i, j]` is -1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `clr[i, j]` is -1**.
