Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, and `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`. If `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X', then `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is increased by 1, and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, with `n` greater than `i + 1`. Otherwise, `clr` has the key (i, 1) with the value -1, `j` is reset to 1, and the element `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X'.***
