The code initializes an empty dictionary `clr`. This does not affect the previous values of `t`, `n`, `M`, `k`, or `K`, as it is a new variable and does not alter any existing variables. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged for all other variables. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`; `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `K` is the integer result of `k / 3.0; clr is an empty dictionary.**
