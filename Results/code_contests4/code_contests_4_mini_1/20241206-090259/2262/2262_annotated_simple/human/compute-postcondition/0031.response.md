The expression `(i + j) % 3` computes the remainder when the sum of `i` and `j` is divided by 3. The variable `j` is 2, and `i` can be any integer. The result of this calculation will determine which index of the `cnt` list is incremented by 1.

Since `j` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(i + 2) % 3`. This will yield results based on the value of `i`:

- If `i % 3` is 0, then `(0 + 2) % 3` results in 2.
- If `i % 3` is 1, then `(1 + 2) % 3` results in 0.
- If `i % 3` is 2, then `(2 + 2) % 3` results in 1.

Thus, the `cnt` list at index determined by `(i + 2) % 3` will be incremented. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2; `cnt` is updated based on the value of `(i + 2) % 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2; `cnt` is updated based on the value of `(i + 2) % 3.**
