According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is determined by the return value of `func_1()` and is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300), the loop will execute at least once. The variable `k` is initially set to 0, but it does not impact the execution of the loop itself. The underscore `_` is used as a throwaway variable in this case.

Thus, the variables `t`, `M`, and `k` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. We only need to confirm that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `M` is an empty list, `k` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
