The value of `use_clr` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `use_clr` is 0, after execution, `use_clr` will be 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `use_clr` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `use_clr` is 1**
