Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `cnt` is updated based on the count of 'X' in `M[i + 1]`, `j` is 2, and the element `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X'. If `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X', then `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `(i + j) % 3`, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `clr[i, j]` is set to -1.***
