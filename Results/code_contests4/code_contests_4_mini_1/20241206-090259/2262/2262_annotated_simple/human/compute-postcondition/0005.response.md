The expression `sum([(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])` calculates how many elements in the last element of the list `M` (i.e., `M[-1]`) are either 'X' or 'O'. Each occurrence of 'X' or 'O' contributes 1 to the sum.

- The value of `k` is incremented by the result of the sum, which counts the occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in `M[-1]`. 
- The previous value of `k` is 0, so the new value of `k` will be equal to the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `k` after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `M` is a list containing the result of `func_3()`, `k` is the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]**
