Postcondition: ***`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `j` is 0. If `clr[5, 0]` equals `use_clr`, then `M[5][0]` is 'O' and `chg` is increased by 1. There are no changes if `clr[5, 0]` does not equal `use_clr`.***
