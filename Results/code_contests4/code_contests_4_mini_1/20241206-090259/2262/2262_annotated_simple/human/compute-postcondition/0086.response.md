The value of `M[i][j]` is assigned the character 'O'. The variable `use_clr` is 3, but it does not affect the assignment of 'O' to `M[i][j]`. The previous values of the affected variable `M[i][j]` are not specified, but now it is set to 'O'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than 0, `chg` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is now 'O'.**
