The value of `chg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `chg` is 0, so after execution, `chg` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `use_clr` is 3, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are all less than or equal to K, `t` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than 0, `chg` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is now 'O'.
