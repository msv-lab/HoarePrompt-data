t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) indicating the size of the grid; each grid consists of n strings of length n, containing only the characters 'X' or '.', and at least one cell is not empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
