The function does not accept parameters and processes a grid of size n x n consisting of characters '.' and 'X'. It counts the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the grid, modifying the grid by replacing some 'X' characters with 'O' based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the modified grid. The function relies on the output of other functions (`func_1` and `func_3`) to gather input data and does not return any value.
