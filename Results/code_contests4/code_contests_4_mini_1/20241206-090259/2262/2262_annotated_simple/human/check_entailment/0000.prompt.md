You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type O do not appear in the input of the easy version.

Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.

In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are n rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: X and O. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.

<image> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations. The patterns in the second row are draw configurations. 

In an operation, you can change an X to an O, or an O to an X. Let k denote the total number of tokens in the grid. Your task is to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ (rounding down) operations.

You are not required to minimize the number of operations.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) — the size of the grid.

The following n lines each contain a string of n characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the i-th row and j-th column is '.' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: 'X' or 'O'.

It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.

In the easy version, the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

Output

For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.

We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

XX.XXO
XOXXOX
OXX.XX
XOOXXO
XX.X.X
OXXOXX
XOX.X
.X..X
XXO.O
..X..
..X..

Note

In the first test case, there are initially three 'X' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to 'O' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed 1≤ ⌊ 5/3⌋ token.

In the second test case, we change only 9≤ ⌊ 32/3⌋ tokens, and there does not exist any three 'X' or 'O' consecutive in a row or column, so it is a draw.

In the third test case, we change only 3≤ ⌊ 12/3⌋ tokens, and the resulting grid is a draw.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. The grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters where each character is either '.' or 'X'. It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty and the character 'O' does not appear in the input. The total number of characters across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user, which is within the range of 1 to 100 for 't' and 1 to 300 for 'n'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) indicating the size of the grid; each grid consists of n strings of length n, containing only the characters 'X' or '.', and at least one cell is not empty. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 300 inclusive for each test case, and the grid consists of n strings of n characters each, where each character is either '.' or 'X'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters, where each character is either '.' (empty cell) or 'X' (token), and 'O' does not appear in the input. The total number of cells across all test cases is guaranteed not to exceed 300.

    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns the string `s` with the last character removed, where `s` represents a row of the grid consisting of `n` characters, each being either '.' or 'X'

#Function 5:

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
