t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the grid. The grid consists of n strings, each containing n characters, where each character is either '.' (empty cell) or 'X' (token), and 'O' does not appear in the input. The total number of cells across all test cases is guaranteed not to exceed 300.
