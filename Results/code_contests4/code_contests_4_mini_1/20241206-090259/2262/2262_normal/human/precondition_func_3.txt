t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, n is an integer representing the size of the grid (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) followed by n strings each containing n characters that are either '.' or 'X'. The total number of characters across all test cases is guaranteed to be non-empty and does not exceed 300.
