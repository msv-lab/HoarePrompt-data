The code snippet updates the `cnt` list at the index determined by `(i + j) % 3`, where `j` is 1. Since `cnt` is updated to [1, 0, 0] based on the value of `i`, we need to calculate the specific index to update. 

Let's break it down:
1. The current value of `cnt` is [1, 0, 0].
2. The value of `j` is 1.
3. The index to update is calculated as `(i + j) % 3`, which means we need to consider the value of `i`. 
4. Depending on the value of `i`, the index will yield different results:
   - If `i % 3 == 0`, the index is `(0 + 1) % 3 = 1`.
   - If `i % 3 == 1`, the index is `(1 + 1) % 3 = 2`.
   - If `i % 3 == 2`, the index is `(2 + 1) % 3 = 0`.

Now, let's update `cnt` based on these possible index values:
- If `i % 3 == 0`, `cnt[1]` becomes 1, so `cnt` will be updated to [1, 1, 0].
- If `i % 3 == 1`, `cnt[2]` becomes 1, so `cnt` will be updated to [1, 0, 1].
- If `i % 3 == 2`, `cnt[0]` becomes 2, so `cnt` will be updated to [2, 0, 0].

Thus, the output state reflects all possible conditions for the update to `cnt`. 

Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, `cnt` is updated to [1, 1, 0] if `i % 3 == 0`, [1, 0, 1] if `i % 3 == 1`, [2, 0, 0] if `i % 3 == 2`, `j` is 1, `clr[i, j]` is (i + 1) % 3.**
