To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet step by step. 

1. The code modifies the variable `k` by adding the count of 'X' and 'O' found in the last element of the list `M`. 
2. The expression `sum([(1) for x in M[-1] if x in 'XO'])` creates a list comprehension that counts how many times 'X' or 'O' appears in `M[-1]`. Each occurrence contributes a value of 1.
3. The value of `k` is updated by adding this count to its current value.

Since the initial state of `k` before this operation is not explicitly defined, we can only state that it is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in `M[-1]`, but we cannot specify the exact new value of `k` without knowing the content of `M[-1]`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the changes made to `k` without specifying its exact value.

Output State: **`k` is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `_` is 2, and we append the result of func_3() to `M`.**
