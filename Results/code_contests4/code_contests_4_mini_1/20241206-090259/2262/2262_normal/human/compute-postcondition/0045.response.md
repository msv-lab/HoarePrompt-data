The code snippet increments a specific index of the `cnt` list based on the value of `(i + j) % 3`. The previous values of the affected variables are `j`, which is 1, and `i`, whose value is not provided but is implied to be part of a loop or context. 

The calculation for the index is `(i + j) % 3`, so we need to consider the possible values of `i`. Since `j` is 1, the resulting index will be dependent on `i` as follows:

- If `i` is 0, the index will be `(0 + 1) % 3 = 1`.
- If `i` is 1, the index will be `(1 + 1) % 3 = 2`.
- If `i` is 2, the index will be `(2 + 1) % 3 = 0`.
- For `i` greater than 2, the pattern continues with the same modulo operation.

Therefore, the value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` will be incremented by 1 at the index determined by the above calculations. However, without knowing the specific value of `i`, we cannot determine which index of `cnt` is being modified.

The other variables (`k`, `n`, `j`, and `clr[i, j]`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State will reflect the increment operation on `cnt` while acknowledging the unknown `i`.

Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1 based on `i`.**
