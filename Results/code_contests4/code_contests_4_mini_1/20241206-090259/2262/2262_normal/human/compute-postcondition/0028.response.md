Postcondition: ***`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, if `M[i][j]` is 'X', then `cnt` is updated to [1, 1, 0] if `i % 3 == 0`, [1, 0, 1] if `i % 3 == 1`, or [2, 0, 0] if `i % 3 == 2`, and `clr[i, j]` is set to (i + 1) % 3. Otherwise, if `M[i][j]` is not 'X', `cnt` remains [1, 0, 0], and `clr[i, j]` is set to -1.***
