The code increments the value of `cnt` at the index `(i + j) % 3` by 1. The variables affected are `cnt`, `i`, and `j`. Since `j` is 1, we need to evaluate `(i + j) % 3` which simplifies to `(i + 1) % 3`. The previous value of `cnt` at that index is unknown, but it will be incremented by 1. The values of `k`, `n`, and the specific state of `clr[i, j]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, `j` is 1, and `cnt[(i + 1) % 3]` is increased by 1.
