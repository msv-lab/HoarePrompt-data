Postcondition: ***`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are either greater than `K` or equal to 0, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `M[0][0]` is 'O', `M[0][1]` is 'O', and if `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, then `clr[0, 0]` is equal to `use_clr`, and the state of the program updates accordingly; if `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, `chg` becomes 2, otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged.***
