The value of `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O'. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `M[0][2]` will now be 'O'. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` must be greater than 2, `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are either greater than `K` or equal to 0, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `M[0][0]` is 'O', `M[0][1]` is 'O', and `M[0][2]` is 'O'.

Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` must be greater than 2, `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are either greater than `K` or equal to 0, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `M[0][0]` is 'O', `M[0][1]` is 'O', `M[0][2]` is 'O'**
