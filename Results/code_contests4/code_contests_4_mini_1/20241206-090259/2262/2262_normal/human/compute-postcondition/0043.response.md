According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `j` as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1, which indicates that the loop can execute at least one more time. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 1. 

State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
