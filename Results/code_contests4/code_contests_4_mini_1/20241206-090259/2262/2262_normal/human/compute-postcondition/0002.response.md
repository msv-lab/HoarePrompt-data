The variable `k` is assigned the value 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `grid`, and `M`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `grid` is represented as a list of `n` strings; `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `grid` is represented as a list of `n` strings; `M` is an empty list; `k` is 0**
