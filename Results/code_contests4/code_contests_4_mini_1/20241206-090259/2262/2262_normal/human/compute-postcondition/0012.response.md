To analyze the loop's output state after all iterations, let's summarize the effects of the loop based on the provided information.

1. The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300).
2. During each iteration, a new value is appended to the list `M` from the function `func_3()`.
3. The variable `k` is incremented by the count of characters 'X' and 'O' found in the most recently appended element of `M` during each iteration.

After `n` iterations, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- The list `M` will contain `n` elements because `func_3()` is called `n` times, and each result is appended to `M`.
- The variable `k` will be the total count of 'X' and 'O' characters found in all `n` last appended elements of `M`.

Since all the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop, we can summarize the final output state as follows:

Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `M` is a list containing `n` results from `func_3()`.**
