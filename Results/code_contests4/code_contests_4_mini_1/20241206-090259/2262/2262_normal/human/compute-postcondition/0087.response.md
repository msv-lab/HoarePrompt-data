The value of `chg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `chg` is 0, so after execution, `chg` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, `cnt[0]` is greater than `K` or `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than `K` or `cnt[1]` is 0, `cnt[2]` is greater than `K` or `cnt[2]` is 0, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `M[0][0]` is 'O', and `clr[0, 0]` is equal to `use_clr`.
