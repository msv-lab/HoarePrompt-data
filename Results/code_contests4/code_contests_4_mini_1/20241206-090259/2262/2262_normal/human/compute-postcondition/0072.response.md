Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`. For each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if `M[i][j]` is 'X', then `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` has been incremented for each occurrence of 'X'; otherwise, all `clr[i, j]` values have been set to -1.**
