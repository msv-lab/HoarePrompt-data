According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop is designed to iterate `n` times, and the variable `_` serves as a loop counter that starts from 0 and increments with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 1, and for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `_` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
