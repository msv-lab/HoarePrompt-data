According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently the value that was last used in the loop (which is `i` from the previous iteration). Given that `j` is `n - 1`, it indicates that `j` will also be adjusted based on the value of `i` in the next iteration. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be one unit larger than the last value. Therefore, `i` should become `i + 1`. 

At the start of the next iteration, `n` must still be at least `i + 1` for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i`, which will be incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `i` after the increment.

State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i`**
