The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `i` and `j` are known as incremented values from their previous states. The value of `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, `j` is the incremented value of the previous `j`, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, `j` is the incremented value of the previous `j`, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1.**
