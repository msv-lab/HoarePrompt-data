The code `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the count of the element at the index `(i + j) % 3` in the `cnt` list (or array). The values of `i` and `j` are already known (with `j` being incremented by 1), so we can compute the result based on those values. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not directly impacted by this line.

The output state will reflect the updated count in the `cnt` array.

Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `n` is at least 1; `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`; `j` is now incremented by 1; `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is increased by 1.**
