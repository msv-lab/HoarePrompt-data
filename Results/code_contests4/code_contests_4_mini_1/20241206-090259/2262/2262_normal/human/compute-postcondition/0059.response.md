Postcondition: ***`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i`, and `j` is 1. The element `M[i][j]` is not 'X' (i.e., it is 'O' or another character).***
