According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the current iteration variable `_`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`k` is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the new last element of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `_` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
