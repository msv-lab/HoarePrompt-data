The function `func_5` accepts parameters `t` and `n`, along with a grid represented as a list of `n` strings. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. The grid consists of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters that are either '.' or 'X'. 

The function processes this grid and provides output based on the characters in the grid. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a grid represented as a list of strings of characters, and to perform operations based on the contents of the grid within the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (an integer between 1 and 100), n (an integer between 1 and 300), and a grid (a list of n strings containing '.' or 'X').**
