Postcondition: ***`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `n` is at least 1; `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`; `j` is the incremented value of the previous `j`. If `M[i][j]` is 'X', then `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `clr[i, j]` is set to -1.***
