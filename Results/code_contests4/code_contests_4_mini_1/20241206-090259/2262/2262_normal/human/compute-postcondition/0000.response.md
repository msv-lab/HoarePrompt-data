The variable `n` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1()`. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it falls within the range of 1 to 300, as given in the initial state. The other variables (`t` and `grid`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the possible values for `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `grid` is represented as a list of `n` strings**.
