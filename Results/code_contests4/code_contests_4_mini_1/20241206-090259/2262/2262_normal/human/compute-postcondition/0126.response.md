Postcondition: ***`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` ≤ 300, `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, and `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are either greater than `K` or equal to 0. If `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, then `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O' and `chg` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `clr[i, j]` does not equal `use_clr`, no changes are made to `M[i][j]` or `chg`.***
