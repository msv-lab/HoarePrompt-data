Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 300), and processes a grid represented as a list of `n` strings, where each string contains characters 'X' or '.'. It counts the occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the grid, determines a threshold `K` by dividing the count of 'X' and 'O' by 3, and replaces certain 'X' characters with 'O' based on their positions in the grid. Finally, it prints the modified grid. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `O` is present, nor does it validate the input grid for unexpected characters other than 'X' or '.', which could lead to undefined behavior. **
