The operation `M.append(func_3())` calls the function `func_3()` and appends its return value to the list `M`. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly modified by this operation. However, the last element of `M` will change as a result of appending the return value of `func_3()`. 

Since `k` is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, after the function call, `k` will reflect this new count based on the updated last element of the list. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `_`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that the last element of `M` is now a new value from `func_3()`, and `k` is updated based on the counts of 'X' and 'O' in that new element.

Output State: **`k` is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the new last element of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `_` is 1**
