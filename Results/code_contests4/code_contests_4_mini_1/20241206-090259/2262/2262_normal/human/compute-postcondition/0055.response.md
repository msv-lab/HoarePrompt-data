According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute a second time, the condition `n` must be greater than `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than `i` at the start of the loop. Also, `j` should be set to the value that signifies the start of the loop for the current iteration, which is 0 for the first execution of the loop and 1 for the second execution.

State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i`, and `j` is 1**
