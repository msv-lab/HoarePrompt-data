Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `K` is `k / 3.0`; `cnt` contains counts of 'X' based on their positions modulo 3; `clr` contains calculated values for each element in `M` where 'X' is present, and -1 for elements where 'O' is present.**
