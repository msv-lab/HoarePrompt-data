According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `n`. 

If `j` is currently equal to `n - 1`, then for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to `n`, which means the loop cannot continue. However, if `j` is less than `n - 1`, then `j` can be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to its incremented value, and `n` must remain greater than `j`. 

State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`, `j` is the incremented value of the previous `j`**
