According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from 0 to `n-1`. Given the constraints that `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable, and it does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the first iteration—it will take on values from 0 up to `n-1` automatically as the loop progresses.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and since `_` will be 0 during the first iteration, it is sufficient to state that it will initialize itself accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
