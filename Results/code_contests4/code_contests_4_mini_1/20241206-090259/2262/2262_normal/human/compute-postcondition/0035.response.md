According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is currently at its last value used in the loop, to execute the loop one more time, `i` will become `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, which means that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `n` is at least 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `i` will be `i + 1`.**
