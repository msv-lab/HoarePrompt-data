According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
