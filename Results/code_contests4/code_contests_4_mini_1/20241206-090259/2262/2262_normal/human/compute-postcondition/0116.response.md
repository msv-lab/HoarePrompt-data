Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` ≤ 300, `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, and `cnt[2]` are either greater than `K` or equal to 0, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is the number of elements in `clr` where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr` for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 2, `M[2][j]` is 'O' for each `j` where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`, and `clr[2, j]` is equal to `use_clr` for the current value of `j`.**
