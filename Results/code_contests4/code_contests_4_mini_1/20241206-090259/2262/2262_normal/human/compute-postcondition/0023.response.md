Postcondition: ***`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `K` is `k / 3.0`, if `M[i][j]` is 'X', then `cnt` is updated to [1, 0, 0] (or the respective index depending on `i`), `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is 'X'. If `M[i][j]` is not 'X', then `clr` is a dictionary with key `(i, j)` assigned the value -1, `cnt` remains [0, 0, 0], `j` is 0, and `M[i][j]` is not 'X'.***
