According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. Since `j` is incremented in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented from its previous value, and `i` is already incremented. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `j` must be equal to its incremented value from the last iteration, which is now `j + 1`, and it must be less than `n`.

State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `n` is at least 1; `i` is the incremented value of the previous `i`; `j` is now incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`.**
