Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `K` is `k / 3.0`; `cnt[0]` is greater than `K` or `cnt[0]` is 0; `use_clr` is 2 and for the loop to execute again, `cnt[1]` must be greater than `K` or equal to 0.**
