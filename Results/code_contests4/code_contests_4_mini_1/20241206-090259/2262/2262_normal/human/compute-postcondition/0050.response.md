The value of `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 2, so `i + j` can be determined based on the value of `i`. The expression `(i + j) % 3` gets the remainder when `i + 2` is divided by 3. 

Since `cnt` is being updated at the index determined by `(i + 2) % 3`, the specific value of `cnt` at that index will increase by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `cnt` or `i`, so the exact outcome of the update to `cnt` cannot be determined.

Therefore, the output state reflects the increment operation and the values of other variables, but does not specify the exact value of `cnt` since `i` is unknown.

Output State: **`k` is the total count of 'X' and 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `cnt` at index `((i + 2) % 3)` is incremented by 1.**
