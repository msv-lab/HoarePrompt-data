The code snippet calculates the sum of 1 for each character in the last element of the list `M` that is either 'X' or 'O'. The value of `k` is incremented by this sum. 

Since `M` is appended with the return value of `func_3()`, we assume that `M` has at least one element, which we denote as `M[-1]`. The previous values of `k` and `M[-1]` are not specified, so we cannot provide definite values for `k` or the sum.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the computation taking place without specific values:

Output State: **`k` is incremented by the count of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of `M`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 300, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `_` is 0**
