According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cap`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `cap`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6.
- Depending on the divisibility of `n` by `i`, `ans` is either [2, 2] or [3], and `cap` is updated accordingly. 
- If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `n` is updated to `n // i`, and `cap` is updated to `sqrt(n // i)`.
- If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is either [2] if `n` is divisible by 2, or an empty list if `n` is not divisible by 2; `i` is incremented by 1, and `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is divisible by 2 or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is not divisible by 2.

For the loop to execute again:
- If `i` is incremented by 1, it needs to be ensured that the new `i` is still less than or equal to `cap`.
- If `n` is divisible by 2, `n` must be at least 8 for the loop to execute again. 
- If `n` is not divisible by 2, `n` must be at least 9.

Given that `cap` would be `sqrt(n)` or `sqrt(n // 2)`, we need to ensure that after updating `n`, `cap` remains valid for the new condition of `i`.

Thus, if `i` was incremented, we need to ensure that `cap` is adjusted accordingly to allow `i` to be less than or equal to `cap`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. If `n` is divisible by `i`, we need to set `n` to a value such that after dividing it by `i`, it remains at least 8.
2. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 9.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to either be at least 8 if divisible by 2 or at least 9 if not divisible by 2, and `i` must be less than or equal to `cap`.**
