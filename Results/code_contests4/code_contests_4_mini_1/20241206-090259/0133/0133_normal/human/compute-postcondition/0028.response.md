The code `ans.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is either a prime number or 1 and is greater than 1, it will be appended to `ans`. The rest of the variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a prime number or 1 and greater than 1; `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` plus `n`; `i` is greater than `cap`; `cap` is equal to the square root of the final value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a prime number or 1 and greater than 1; `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` plus `n`; `i` is greater than `cap`; `cap` is equal to the square root of the final value of `n`.**
