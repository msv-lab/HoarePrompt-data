The variable `c` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is undefined, the value of `c` cannot be calculated as it involves a variable that does not have a defined value. Therefore, the program execution does not change the previously defined variables `n`, `a`, or `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is math.factorial(n); `b` is math.factorial(k), where `k` is undefined; variable `c` cannot be calculated due to undefined `k`.**
