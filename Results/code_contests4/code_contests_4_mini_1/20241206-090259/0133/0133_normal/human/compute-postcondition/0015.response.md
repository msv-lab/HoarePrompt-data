The `ans` list is updated by appending the value of `i`. The value of `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `n` is divisible by 2. If `n` is divisible by 2, `ans` is initially [2], and `i` is 2. If `n` is not divisible by 2, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is 3. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will reflect the updated `ans` list based on the divisibility of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; if `n` is divisible by 2, `ans` is [2, 2], `i` is 2, `cap` is `sqrt(n // 2)`; if `n` is not divisible by 2, `ans` is [3], `i` is 3, `cap` is `sqrt(n)`**
