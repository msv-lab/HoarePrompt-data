The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division with `i`. Depending on whether `n` was previously divisible by 2 or not, `i` takes the values 2 or 3, respectively. Therefore, if `n` is divisible by 2, the new value of `n` will be `n // 2`. If `n` is not divisible by 2, the new value of `n` will be `n // 3`. The values of `ans` and `cap` remain unchanged, but `n` is impacted. 

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `ans` is either [2, 2] or [3], `i` is either 2 or 3, `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` or `sqrt(n)`**
