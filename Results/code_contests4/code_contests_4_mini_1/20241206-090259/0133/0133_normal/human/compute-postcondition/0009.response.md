The expression `div = a // (b * c)` involves the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

- `a` is defined as `math.factorial(n)`, where `n` is an integer between 3 and 1,000,000.
- `b` is defined as `math.factorial(k)`, but `k` is undefined, which means `b` cannot be calculated.
- `c` cannot be calculated because `k` is undefined.

Since `b` and `c` are both undefined, the expression `(b * c)` results in an undefined operation. Consequently, the division `a // (b * c)` cannot be performed due to the undefined value.

Therefore, the output state is that the calculation cannot be executed due to the undefined variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is math.factorial(n); `b` is undefined; `c` cannot be calculated due to undefined `k`; therefore, `div` cannot be calculated due to undefined variables.**
