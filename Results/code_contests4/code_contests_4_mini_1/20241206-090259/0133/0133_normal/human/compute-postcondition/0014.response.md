To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the given conditions based on the current state of the variables.

1. The loop checks if `i` is less than or equal to `cap`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, depending on whether `n` is divisible by 2.
3. The value of `cap` is defined based on `n`: 
   - If `n` is divisible by 2, `cap` is `sqrt(n // 2)`.
   - If `n` is not divisible by 2, `cap` is `sqrt(n}`.

Given the conditions:
- If `i` is 2 and `n` is even, `i` could continue to increment until it exceeds `cap`.
- If `i` is 3 and `n` is odd, the same logic applies.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `cap` after the last iteration. 

1. If `i` is currently 2 and `n` is even, then `cap` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Thus, `n` must be at least 8 (since `sqrt(4) = 2`).
2. If `i` is currently 3 and `n` is odd, then `cap` must be at least 3, which indicates `n` must be at least 9 (since `sqrt(9) = 3`).

In both cases, we need to ensure that `cap` is greater than or equal to `i`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- If `i` is 2, then `n` needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 8.
- If `i` is 3, then `n` needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 9.

Since we are not given specific values for `n`, we will keep the general conditions:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, if `n` is divisible by 2, then `ans` is [2], `i` is 2, `cap` is `sqrt(n // 2)` and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 8; if `n` is not divisible by 2, then `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `cap` is `sqrt(n)`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 9.**
