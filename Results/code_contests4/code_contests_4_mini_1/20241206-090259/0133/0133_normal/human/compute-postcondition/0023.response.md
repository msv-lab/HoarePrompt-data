The value of `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`, where `n` has already been updated to `n // i`. The previous values of `n` and `i` affect the calculation of `cap`. Since `n` is now the result of the integer division by `i`, we can conclude that `cap` will hold the square root of this updated value of `n`. The value of `ans` is not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to `n // i`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `cap` is the square root of the updated `n`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `ans` remains unchanged, `cap` is sqrt(n)**
