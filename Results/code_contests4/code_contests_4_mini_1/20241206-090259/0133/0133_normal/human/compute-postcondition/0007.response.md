The variable `b` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(k)`. However, the variable `k` is not defined in the initial state, and thus its value is unknown. The value of `a` has no impact on the calculation for `b`, as they are independent. Therefore, the output state must reflect the fact that `b` cannot be determined due to the undefined value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is math.factorial(n); `b` is math.factorial(k), where `k` is undefined.**
