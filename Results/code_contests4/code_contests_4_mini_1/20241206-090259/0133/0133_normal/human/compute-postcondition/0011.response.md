The function `func_7` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and `k` is an integer representing the number of distinct edges in the graph constructed from the permutation of length `n`. 

After executing the function body, the function behaves as follows:
- If the conditions for Case_1 are met, the function returns 1.
- If the conditions for Case_2 are met, the function returns 0.
- If the conditions for Case_3 are met, the function attempts to return an undefined variable 'div' due to the presence of undefined variables 'b' and 'k'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on specific conditions, it can return either 1, 0, or an undefined variable due to other undefined variables in the logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, and returns 1 or 0 based on specific conditions, or may attempt to return an undefined variable due to other undefined variables.**
