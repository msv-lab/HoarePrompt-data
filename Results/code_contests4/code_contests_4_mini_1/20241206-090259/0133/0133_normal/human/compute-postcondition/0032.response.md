Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of its prime factors. If `n` is 1, it returns an empty list. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, the function returns a list containing `n` itself as its only prime factor. If `n` has any prime factors, it returns a list of those factors. **
