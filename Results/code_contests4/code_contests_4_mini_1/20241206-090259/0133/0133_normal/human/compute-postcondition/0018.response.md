Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `ans` is either [2] if `n` is divisible by 2 or an empty list if `n` is not divisible by 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is divisible by 2 or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is not divisible by 2; for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 8 if divisible by 2 or at least 9 if not divisible by 2.**
