`a` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n)`. The value of `n` is known to be an integer within the range 3 to 10^6, and since `k` is defined to be less than or equal to `n`, it does not affect the calculation of `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is the factorial of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `a` is math.factorial(n)**
