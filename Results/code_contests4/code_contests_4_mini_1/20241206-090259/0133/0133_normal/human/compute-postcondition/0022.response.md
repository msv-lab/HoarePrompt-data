The value of `n` is updated to be the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, the new value of `n` will depend on the value of `i`. The variable `ans` remains updated to include `i` in its list, but its specific state is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to `n // i`, and `ans` is updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, and `ans` is updated to include `i`.**
