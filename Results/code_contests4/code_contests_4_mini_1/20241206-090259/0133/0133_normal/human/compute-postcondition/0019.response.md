Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `n` is updated to `n // i`, and `ans` is either [2, 2] or [3], with `i` being either 2 or 3, and `cap` is updated to `sqrt(n // i)`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is either [2] if `n` is divisible by 2, or an empty list if `n` is not divisible by 2; `i` is incremented by 1, `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` if `n` is divisible by 2 or `sqrt(n)` if `n` is not divisible by 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 8 if divisible by 2 or at least 9 if not divisible by 2.***
