Postcondition: ***If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, then `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` plus `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, and `cap` is equal to the square root of the final value of `n`. If `n` is 1, then `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n`, which is empty, while `i` remains greater than `cap`, which is equal to the square root of 1, which is 1.***
