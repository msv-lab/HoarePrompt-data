The value of `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`. The value of `n` is updated to `n // i`, and since `cap` is either `sqrt(n // 2)` or `sqrt(n)`, we will consider the updated value of `n` for calculating `cap`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is updated to `n // i`, `ans` is either [2, 2] or [3], `i` is either 2 or 3, `cap` is `sqrt(n // i)`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `ans` is either [2, 2] or [3], `i` is either 2 or 3, `cap` is `sqrt(n // i)`**
