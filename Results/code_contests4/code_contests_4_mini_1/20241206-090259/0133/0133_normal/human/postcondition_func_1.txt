The function does not accept parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input, split by spaces. However, it does not enforce the condition that the list must contain `n` integers where \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\). Instead, it simply returns whatever integers the user inputs, so the function's behavior is dependent on the user's input without any checks for the length or range of the input list.
