#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user, which must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input from the user and returns that integer. The user is expected to provide an integer that meets the condition 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, but the function does not enforce this range check and will return any integer input, including those outside this range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input, which is split by spaces. The list will contain n integers, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from user input, split by spaces. However, it does not enforce the condition that the list must contain `n` integers where \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\). Instead, it simply returns whatever integers the user inputs, so the function's behavior is dependent on the user's input without any checks for the length or range of the input list.

def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of the string 's' except for the last character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list containing all characters of the input string `s`, excluding the last character. If the input string is empty, it will return an empty list. If the input string has only one character, it will also return an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers parsed from the input, which consists of space-separated values
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from space-separated input values. It assumes that the input conforms to the specified format and does not handle any errors related to invalid input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string 's' at each space character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a single input string from the user, then returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting that input string at each space character. The function does not handle any edge cases related to input, such as leading or trailing spaces, which may result in empty strings being included in the output list.

If `n` is 1, then `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n`, which is empty, while `i` remains greater than `cap`, which is equal to the square root of 1, which is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list of prime factors of the original value of n plus n if n is a prime number greater than 1, or an empty list if n is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of its prime factors. If `n` is 1, it returns an empty list. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, the function returns a list containing `n` itself as its only prime factor. If `n` has any prime factors, it returns a list of those factors.

        div = a // (b * c)
        return div
        #The program returns an undefined variable 'div' due to the presence of undefined variables 'b' and 'k'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is constrained between 3 and 10^6. If `n` is equal to 1 or `k`, it returns 1. If `k` is greater than `n`, it returns 0. If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, it attempts to calculate and return the number of combinations of `n` items taken `k` at a time using the formula `n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`. However, there is an issue in the code because it references `math.factorial` without properly importing the `math` module, and the function also has a potential error due to the undefined variable `k` in the return statement. This results in the function potentially failing to return a valid output in some cases.
