#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user, where the value must be within the range of 3 to 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input from the user and returns that integer value. However, there are no constraints enforced within the function to ensure that the input value is within the specified range of 3 to 10^6. Therefore, the function can return any integer input, regardless of whether it meets the stated conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a single integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers generated from user input, where the input consists of space-separated integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept parameters directly; it returns a list of integers generated from user input, where the input consists of space-separated integers. It does not handle any potential errors, such as invalid input (non-integer values), and will raise a ValueError if the input cannot be converted to integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of the string 's' except the last one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of all characters from the input string `s`, excluding the last character. Note that if the input string is empty, it will return an empty list since there are no characters to include.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers obtained from the input split into a list of strings, which can be converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object that generates integers from a space-separated input string. It does not handle any edge cases related to input validation, such as non-integer values or empty input, which may lead to errors when the resulting map is consumed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string 's' at each space character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `s` at each space character. If the input string is empty, it returns a list containing a single empty string.

        ans.append(n)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer that is a prime factorization result or 1. If `n` is greater than 1, then `ans` contains all prime factors including the new value of `n`, `i` remains greater than `cap`, and `cap` is less than or equal to 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list 'ans' that contains all prime factors including the new value of 'n' if 'n' is greater than 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of all prime factors of `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns a list containing just the integer 1. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1, which is not within the specified range.

        return div
        #The program returns the integer division result of the factorial of n by the product of the factorial of k and the factorial of (n - k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `k`. It returns 1 if `n` is either 1 or equal to `k`. It returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the integer division result of the factorial of `n` divided by the product of the factorial of `k` and the factorial of (n - k). The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than `k` (invalid inputs), but for valid inputs, it correctly computes the binomial coefficient.
