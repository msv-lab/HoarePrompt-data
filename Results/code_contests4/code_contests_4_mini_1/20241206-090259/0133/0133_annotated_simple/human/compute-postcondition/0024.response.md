The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` is increased by 1**
