The value of `n` is updated to be the integer division of `n` by `i`. Since `n` is an integer within the range of 4 to 10^6, and `i` is a positive integer, `n` will be reduced but its previous exact value is unknown. The variable `ans` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` // `i` ≤ 10^6; `ans` is updated to include `i`.**
