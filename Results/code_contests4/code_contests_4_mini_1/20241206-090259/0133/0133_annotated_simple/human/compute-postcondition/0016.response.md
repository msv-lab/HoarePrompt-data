The value of `n` is updated by performing floor division with `i`, which means `n` will be reduced to `n // i`. The previous value of `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^6, and `i` is a value that has been appended to `ans`. The exact previous value of `n` and `i` is not specified, but this operation will change `n`. The value of `ans` remains unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is appended to `ans**
