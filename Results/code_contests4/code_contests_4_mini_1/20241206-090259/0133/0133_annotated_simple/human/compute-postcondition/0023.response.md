The variable `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`, which is the square root of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^6\), the value of `cap` will be a floating-point number between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `cap` is the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `cap` is the square root of `n`**
