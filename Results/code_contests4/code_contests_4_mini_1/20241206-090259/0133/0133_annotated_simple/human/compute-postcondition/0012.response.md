Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `k`. It returns 1 if `n` is either 1 or equal to `k`. It returns 0 if `k` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the integer division result of the factorial of `n` divided by the product of the factorial of `k` and the factorial of (n - k). The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than `k` (invalid inputs), but for valid inputs, it correctly computes the binomial coefficient. **
