To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i <= cap`. 

1. The current state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6. We also know that `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`, so `cap` will also be a positive number derived from `n`.

2. For the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be less than or equal to `cap`. Therefore, we need to ensure that this condition holds.

3. If during the last iteration, `i` was equal to `cap`, the loop will not execute again as the condition `i <= cap` won't hold for the next iteration. In this case, we would need to adjust `i` to be less than `cap` to allow the loop to execute again.

4. If `i` is less than `cap`, then the loop can execute one more time without any modification.

In summary, we do not know the exact values of `i` and `cap` from the provided state, but we can conclude:

- If `i` is currently equal to `cap`, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `cap` for the loop to execute again.
- If `i` is already less than `cap`, we can simply repeat the state.

Given the information, we will assume that `i` is currently equal to `cap` since no other information is provided:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `cap`**
