The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns a list `ans` that contains all prime factors including the value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_6 is to accept an integer `n` and return a list of prime factors if `n` is greater than 1 or a list containing 1 if `n` is equal to 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns a list containing the single integer 1 if n is equal to 1; otherwise, it returns a list of all prime factors of n if n is greater than 1.**
