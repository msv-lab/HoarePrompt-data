`a` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n)`, which calculates the factorial of `n`. The value of `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, so `a` will be a large integer representing the product of all positive integers up to `n`. The states of the other variable `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer, and `a` is the factorial of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`**
