The code snippet provided is `ans.append(i)`, which adds the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since there are no details provided about the current value of `i`, we can't determine its specific value. However, we know that `ans` is likely a list that can hold multiple values.

The state of `n` does not change due to this operation, nor does it affect any conditions regarding its evenness or oddness for loop execution. The only change is that `i` is added to the list `ans`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` is appended to `ans`.**
