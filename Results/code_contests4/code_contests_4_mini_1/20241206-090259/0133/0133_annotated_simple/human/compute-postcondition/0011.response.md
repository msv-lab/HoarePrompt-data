The function `func_7` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the condition \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and the parameter `k` is also an integer. 

After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on the following cases:
- Case 1: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case 2: The function returns 0.
- Case 3: The function returns the integer division result of the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorial of `k` and the factorial of (n - k).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept two integers, `n` within the specified range and `k`, and return either 1, 0, or the result of a specific factorial calculation based on the given conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (an integer), and returns 1, 0, or the integer division result of the factorial of n by the product of the factorial of k and the factorial of (n - k).**
