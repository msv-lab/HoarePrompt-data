`b` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(k)`, which calculates the factorial of `k`. The previous value of `k` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `b`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k**
