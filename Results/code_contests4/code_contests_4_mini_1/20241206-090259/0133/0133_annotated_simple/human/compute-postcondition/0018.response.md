The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6**
