The code `ans.append(n)` appends the current value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is an integer that is a prime factorization result or 1, and given that `n` is greater than 1, the value of `n` is now added to the `ans`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `cap`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `ans` now contains all prime factors including the new value of `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, and `cap` is less than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ans` now contains all prime factors including the new value of `n`, `i` is greater than `cap`, and `cap` is less than or equal to 1**
