The value of `div` is assigned the result of the integer division of `a` by the product of `b` and `c`. Given that `a` is the factorial of `n`, `b` is the factorial of `k`, and `c` is the factorial of (n - k), `div` effectively calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of (n - k); `div` is the integer division result of `a` by (b * c).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of (n - k); `div` is the integer division result of `a` by (b * c)**.
