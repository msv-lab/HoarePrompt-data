The variable `c` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n - k)`. Since `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and `k` is an integer, the value of `n - k` will also be an integer. Therefore, `c` will be the factorial of the integer result of `n - k`. The states of the other variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer; `a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of (n - k)**
