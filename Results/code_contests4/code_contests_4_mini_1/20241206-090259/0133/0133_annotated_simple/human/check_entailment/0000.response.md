Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Although it consists of various functions that perform certain operations, none of them directly compute the number of cyclic permutations of length `n` based on the graph construction and cycle detection specified in the problem.

Here are the key reasons for the conclusion:

1. **Missing Core Logic**: The problem requires calculating the number of cyclic permutations for a given integer `n`, but there is no implementation or logic in the program that performs this calculation. The functions do not have any connection to constructing a graph based on the permutation and checking for cycles.

2. **Irrelevant Functions**: The functions provided (func_1 to func_7) include operations related to input handling, prime factorization, and combinations (using factorials), which are not relevant to the problem statement about cyclic permutations. For example, `func_6` focuses on prime factorization and `func_7` computes combinations, which are unrelated to the task of counting cyclic permutations.

3. **Lack of Graph Construction**: The problem explicitly describes a method to build a graph based on the permutation and determine if it contains cycles. There are no functions in the provided program that implement this graph construction or cycle detection.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The problem states that the result should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but there is no sign of this operation being applied in the program.

In summary, the program fails to meet the problem requirements due to a lack of necessary functionality to compute cyclic permutations as described, hence it is incorrect.
