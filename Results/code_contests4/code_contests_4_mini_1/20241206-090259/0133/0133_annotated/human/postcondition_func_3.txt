The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input. The number of integers returned is determined by the user input and is not restricted by the function itself, despite the annotation stating that `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. Therefore, there is no enforcement of the range constraint in the code.
