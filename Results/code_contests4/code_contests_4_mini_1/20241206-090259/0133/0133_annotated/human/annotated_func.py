#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from user input, which is expected to be in the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input as an integer and returns this integer value. However, it does not enforce or validate that the input is within the expected range of 3 to 10^6, which means it could return any integer, including values outside this range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the input provided by the user, which can consist of n integers where n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input consisting of integers separated by spaces and returns a list of these integers. There are no checks implemented in the function to ensure that the number of integers falls within the specified range of 3 to 10^6, which means it may accept fewer or more integers than allowed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list of characters from the string 's' excluding the last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input from the user, then returns a list of characters from that string excluding the last character. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing n integers parsed from the input, where n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input. The number of integers returned is determined by the user input and is not restricted by the function itself, despite the annotation stating that `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. Therefore, there is no enforcement of the range constraint in the code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string 's' at each space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `s` at each space. It handles any string input, including empty strings, and will return a list containing a single empty string if the input is empty.

    return ans
    #The program returns the list of all prime factors of the original value of `n` that were found, which includes `n` if it is greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (with the constraint 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of all prime factors of `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns the list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns a list of all prime factors found during the factorization process, which may include `n` itself if it is prime. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or not an integer, and the input constraint of n being at least 3 means the case for n = 1 is not actually applicable for this function's normal usage.

        return div
        #The program returns the value of div, which is the result of the integer division of the factorial of n by the product of the factorials of k and (n - k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` must be between 3 and 10^6. It returns 1 if `n` equals 1 or `k`, 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, and otherwise computes and returns the value of the binomial coefficient C(n, k), which is the result of the integer division of the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorials of `k` and (n - k).
