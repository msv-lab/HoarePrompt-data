To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions related to the variables `i` and `cap`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `cap`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6
- If `n` is divisible by 2, `ans` is updated to [2], `n` is halved, and `cap` is updated to sqrt(n).
- If `n` is not divisible by 2, `ans` remains an empty list, `i` is updated to 3, and `cap` is sqrt(n).

Since the value of `cap` depends on `n`, we need to consider both cases for `n` being even or odd.

1. **If `n` is even**: 
   - Then `n` is halved, and `cap` becomes sqrt(n).
   - Given that `n` is at least 4, after halving, it will still be at least 2, meaning `cap` will also be at least sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.41. Therefore, `cap` will be greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `i` was previously equal to or less than `cap`, it means `i` can also be adjusted to allow the loop to run again. 

2. **If `n` is odd**:
   - In this scenario, `i` is updated to 3 and `cap` is sqrt(n). 
   - Since `n` is at least 4, `cap` will also be at least 2 (since sqrt(4) = 2).
   - Therefore, if `i` is already 3, then `i` will be greater than `cap` if `cap` is less than 3, which can happen if `n` is in the range of 4 to 8. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time:
- If `cap` is greater than `i`, we need to ensure that `i` can be adjusted to be less than or equal to `cap`. Since `i` is updated to 3 when `n` is odd, for the loop to execute again, `cap` needs to be at least 3.

Thus, the conditions for the loop to execute again depend on whether `cap` is greater than or equal to `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and for the loop to execute again, `i` is less than or equal to `cap`.**
