According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cap`. If `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and if `i` divides `n` evenly, `n` is updated to `n // i`, which means `cap` is the square root of the updated `n`. If `i` does not divide `n` evenly, `i` is simply increased by 1, and `cap` remains unchanged.

Since `cap` might have changed if `i` divides `n` evenly, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to the new value of `cap` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is less than or equal to `cap` at the end of the last iteration, we can simply repeat the program state without changes.

Thus, if `cap` is updated, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to the new `cap`. If `cap` remained the same after the last iteration and `i` is still less than or equal to that `cap`, we do not need to make any changes.

However, since we do not know whether `cap` was updated or not and must ensure the loop can execute, we need to check if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of the updated value of `n` (which could be `n // i` if `i` divides `n` evenly). 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `cap`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than or equal to cap**
