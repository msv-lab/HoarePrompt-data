Output State: **`n` is a prime factorization of the original value reduced by all its factors up to `cap`; `ans` contains all prime factors of the original value of `n` that were found; `i` is the first integer greater than `cap`; `cap` is 1 when the loop completes; `n` is greater than 1; `ans` now includes `n`.**
