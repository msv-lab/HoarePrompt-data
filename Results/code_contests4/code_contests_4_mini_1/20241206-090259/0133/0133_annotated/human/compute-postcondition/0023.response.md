The variable `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`. The value of `n` has been updated to `n // i`, but since we do not know the specific numeric values of `n` and `i`, we cannot calculate the exact numerical value of `cap`. However, we can express `cap` in terms of the updated `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, and `cap` is assigned the value `sqrt(n // i)`. 

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, and `cap` is assigned the value `sqrt(n // i)`**.
