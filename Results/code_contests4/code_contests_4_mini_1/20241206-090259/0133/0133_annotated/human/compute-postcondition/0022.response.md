The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division of `n` by `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and since `ans` contains the previous value of `i`, it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` will be reduced according to the division, but the exact value of `n` after the operation depends on the current value of `i`. The output will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` is unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`**
