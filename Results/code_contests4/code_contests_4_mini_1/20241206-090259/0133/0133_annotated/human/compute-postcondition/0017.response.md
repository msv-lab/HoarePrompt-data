The variable `cap` is assigned the value of `sqrt(n)`, where `n` has been updated to `n // i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`. The state of `cap` will depend on the updated value of `n` after the integer division. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` has been updated to `n // i`, `i` remains unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, and `cap` is the square root of the updated `n`.

Output State: **`n` has been updated to `n // i`, `i` remains unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, and `cap` is the square root of the updated `n`.**
