The code `ans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `ans`. The previous values of `i` and `ans` are not provided, but it is stated that the loop executing this code is conditioned on `i` being less than or equal to `cap`. Since this code is executed within a loop, `i` must have a valid value at the time of execution.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `i` has been appended to `ans`, but we cannot determine the specific values of `ans` or `i` without additional context. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` has been appended to `ans`.**
