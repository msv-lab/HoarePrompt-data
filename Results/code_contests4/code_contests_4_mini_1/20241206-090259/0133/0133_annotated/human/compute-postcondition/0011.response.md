The function `func_7` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and `k` is also an integer. The function has three possible return cases. 

In Case 1, the function returns the integer 1. In Case 2, the function returns 0. In Case 3, the function returns the value of `div`, which is the result of the integer division of the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorials of `k` and \((n - k)\). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept the integers `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, return either 1, 0, or the result of a specific mathematical computation involving factorials. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and returns 1, 0, or the result of the integer division of the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorials of `k` and (n - k).**
