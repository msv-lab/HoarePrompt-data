Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6. If `i` divides `n` evenly, `n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` remains unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, and `cap` is the square root of the updated `n`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1, and `cap` remains unchanged.***
