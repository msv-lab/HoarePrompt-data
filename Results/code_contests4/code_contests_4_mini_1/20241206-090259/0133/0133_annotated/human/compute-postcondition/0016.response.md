The value of `n` is updated to `n // i`, where `//` denotes integer division. The previous value of `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and `i` is a value that has been appended to `ans`. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `n`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` remains unchanged, and `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` remains unchanged, and `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`.**
