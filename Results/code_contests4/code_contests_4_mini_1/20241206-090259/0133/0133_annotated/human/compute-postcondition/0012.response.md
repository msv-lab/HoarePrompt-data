Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` must be between 3 and 10^6. It returns 1 if `n` equals 1 or `k`, 0 if `k` is greater than `n`, and otherwise computes and returns the value of the binomial coefficient C(n, k), which is the result of the integer division of the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorials of `k` and (n - k).**
