The code `ans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, it will now also contain the new value of `i`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the loop condition is still valid for executing again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is unchanged, `ans` now contains the previous value of `i` and the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, `i` is unchanged, `ans` now contains the previous value of `i` and the current value of `i.**
