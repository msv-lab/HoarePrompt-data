Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `n` is updated to `n // i`, `i` remains unchanged, `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`, and `cap` is assigned the value `sqrt(n // i)`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`.***
