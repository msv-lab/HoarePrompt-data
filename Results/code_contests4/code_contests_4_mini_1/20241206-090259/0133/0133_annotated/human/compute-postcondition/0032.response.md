Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (with the constraint 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and returns a list of all prime factors of `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, it returns the list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns a list of all prime factors found during the factorization process, which may include `n` itself if it is prime. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or not an integer, and the input constraint of n being at least 3 means the case for n = 1 is not actually applicable for this function's normal usage.**
