The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^6\). If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns the list containing the single integer 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns a list of all prime factors of the original value of `n`, which includes `n` itself if it is greater than 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `n` and return a list of its prime factors or the integer 1 based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns a list containing the integer 1 if n is equal to 1. If n is greater than 1, it returns a list of all prime factors of n, including n itself if it is greater than 1.**
