The variable `div` is assigned the value of `a // (b * c)`. Given that `a` is the factorial of `n`, `b` is the factorial of `k`, and `c` is the factorial of `n - k`, the computation for `div` will yield the number of combinations of `n` items taken `k` at a time, which is denoted as "n choose k".

Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 3 and 10^6, and `k` is also valid under the conditions provided, we know the variables maintain their factorial relationships. The output state reflects these relationships.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer, `n` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `n; a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of `n - k`; `div` is a non-negative integer representing the value of a // (b * c).**
