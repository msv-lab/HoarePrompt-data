The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unchanged, but since the condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `cap`, we assume that `i` was within that limit before the increment. Therefore, after execution, `i` is now one greater than its previous value. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` still contains the previous value of `i`.**
