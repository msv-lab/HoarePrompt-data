The variable `c` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(n - k)`. Given that `n` is an integer within the range 3 to 10^6 and `k` is also an integer that is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `n - k` will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, `c` will be the factorial of this non-negative integer. The values of `a` and `b` (the factorials of `n` and `k`, respectively) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer, `n` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `n; a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`; `c` is the factorial of `n - k`.**
