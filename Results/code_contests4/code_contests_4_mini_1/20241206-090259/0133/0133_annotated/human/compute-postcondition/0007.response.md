The variable `b` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(k)`, where `k` is an integer that is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and `k` is neither equal to `n` nor equal to 1, the value of `b` will be the factorial of `k`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer, `n` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `n; a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6; `k` is an integer, `n` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `n; a` is the factorial of `n`; `b` is the factorial of `k`.**
