To determine the correctness of the provided Python program with respect to the problem description of counting cyclic permutations, we need to analyze the functions and their annotations.

1. **Functionality Overview**: The problem requires us to find the number of cyclic permutations of length `n`. The provided program contains several functions, but none of them seem to implement the logic for counting cyclic permutations directly. They mainly handle input processing, factorial calculation, and prime factorization, which are not relevant to the core problem.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5` all deal with input in some way, but none of them validate that the input is strictly a single integer `n` as described (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). This means that any erroneous input could lead to undefined behavior.
   - The annotations for these functions highlight a lack of checks for input constraints, which could lead to cases where the input does not meet the requirements, thus violating the problem statement.

3. **Cyclic Permutations Calculation**:
   - The crucial function to calculate cyclic permutations based on the graph and edge definitions is missing. Functions `func_6` and `func_7` deal with prime factors and binomial coefficients, but they do not relate to counting cyclic permutations as defined in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Given the input constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), if any input outside this range is accepted due to the lack of validation, it could lead to incorrect results or errors. 
   - The functions do not compute the expected number of cyclic permutations, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem description.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the program does not contain the necessary logic to compute the number of cyclic permutations and lacks input validation, it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to count cyclic permutations of length `n` and does not enforce input constraints, leading to potential incorrect behavior for out-of-range inputs.
