The function accepts two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, which represent the number of horizontal rows (H) and vertical columns (W) in a grid, respectively. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using a recursive approach. Specifically, if `x` is divisible by `y`, it returns `y`; if `y` is divisible by `x`, it returns `x`. If neither is the case, it continues the recursion with the parameters modified to reflect the remainder of the division until a base case is met. The function correctly handles all cases as per the Euclidean algorithm for GCD, but does not explicitly mention that it computes the GCD.
