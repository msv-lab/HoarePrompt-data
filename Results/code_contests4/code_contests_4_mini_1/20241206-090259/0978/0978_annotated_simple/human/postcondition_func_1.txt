The function accepts a 2D list of integers `x4`, where each integer is between 0 and 9. It processes the list based on its length: if it has more than two rows, it recursively combines the result of applying `func_1` to the first two rows with the remaining rows; if it has exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows; if it has only one row, it returns that row.
