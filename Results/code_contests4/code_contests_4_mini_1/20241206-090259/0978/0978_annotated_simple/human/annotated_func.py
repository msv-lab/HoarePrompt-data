#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, y is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid, and the grid contains integers a_{ij} such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for all 1 <= i <= H and 1 <= j <= W. Additionally, 1 <= H, W <= 500.
def func_1(x, y):
    if (x >= y) :
        if (x % y == 0) :
            return y
            #The program returns the non-negative integer y representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid
        else :
            return func_1(y, x % y)
            #The program returns the result of calling func_1 with the values of y (the number of vertical columns) and x % y (the remainder of x when divided by y), where x is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to y and not divisible by y.
    else :
        if (y % x == 0) :
            return x
            #The program returns the non-negative integer x representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, which is less than the number of vertical columns (W)
        else :
            return func_1(x, y % x)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with parameters x and y % x, where x is a non-negative integer representing the number of horizontal rows in the grid, and y % x is the remainder when the number of vertical columns is divided by the number of horizontal rows, which is a value between 0 and x-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, which represent the number of horizontal rows (H) and vertical columns (W) in a grid, respectively. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using a recursive approach. Specifically, if `x` is divisible by `y`, it returns `y`; if `y` is divisible by `x`, it returns `x`. If neither is the case, it continues the recursion with the parameters modified to reflect the remainder of the division until a base case is met. The function correctly handles all cases as per the Euclidean algorithm for GCD, but does not explicitly mention that it computes the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x4 is a 2D list of integers where 1 <= len(x4) <= 500 and 1 <= len(x4[0]) <= 500, and each integer a_{ij} in x4 satisfies 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9.
def func_2(x4):
    if (len(x4) > 2) :
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
        #The program returns the result of func_2, which takes a list combining the output of func_1 applied to the first two rows of the 2D list x4 and the remaining rows from the third row onward.
    else :
        if (len(x4) == 2) :
            return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
            #The program returns the result of the function func_1 applied to the two lists x4[0] and x4[1], which are the first and second rows of the 2D list x4, respectively.
        else :
            return x4[0]
            #The program returns the first (and only) row of the 2D list `x4`, which contains integers between 0 and 9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers `x4`, where each integer is between 0 and 9. It processes the list based on its length: if it has more than two rows, it recursively combines the result of applying `func_1` to the first two rows with the remaining rows; if it has exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows; if it has only one row, it returns that row.
