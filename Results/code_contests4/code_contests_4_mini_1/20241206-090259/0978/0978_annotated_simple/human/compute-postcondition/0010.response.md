The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, where `x` represents the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, and `y` represents the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid. 

- In Case 1, if the function is called, it returns the non-negative integer `y`, which represents the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid.
- In Case 2, if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and not divisible by `y`, the function will return the result of calling `func_1` with `y` and `x % y`.
- In Case 3, if `x` is less than `y`, the function returns the non-negative integer `x`, which represents the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid.
- In Case 4, the function returns the result of calling `func_1` with `x` and `y % x`, where `y % x` is a value between 0 and x-1.

Thus, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, representing the dimensions of a grid, and return specific values based on the relationships and conditions between these two parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, representing the number of horizontal rows (H) and vertical columns (W) in the grid, respectively. It returns y if called directly, or performs additional calculations based on the conditions of x and y, returning either the number of rows, the number of columns, or the result of recursive calls with modified parameters.**
