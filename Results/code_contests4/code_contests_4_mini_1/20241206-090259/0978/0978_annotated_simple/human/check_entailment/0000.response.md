Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The main issues are as follows:

1. **Function Purpose Mismatch**: 
   - The problem description requires an algorithm to maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins by moving coins between adjacent cells in a grid. However, the provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not deal with the movement of coins or the grid structure at all. Instead, they involve calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and returning that value, which is unrelated to the task of maximizing even coin counts in a grid.

2. **No Output for Operations**:
   - The problem description requires the program to output a sequence of operations to move coins, including the count of operations and the specific movements between cells. The program provided does not generate any operations or output in the required format.

3. **Invalid Handling of Input**:
   - The functions are not designed to handle the grid input as specified in the problem description. They only accept two integer parameters or a 2D list without any logic to process the grid's coin distribution.

In conclusion, the provided program does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. It fails to manipulate the grid of coins or produce the required output format for the sequence of operations. Thus, it is incorrect.
