x is a non-negative integer representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, y is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid, and the grid contains integers a_{ij} such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for all 1 <= i <= H and 1 <= j <= W. Additionally, 1 <= H, W <= 500.
