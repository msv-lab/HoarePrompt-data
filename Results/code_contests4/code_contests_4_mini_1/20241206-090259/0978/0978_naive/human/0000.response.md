To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down what the program is attempting to do and what the problem is asking for.

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to maximize the number of cells in a grid that contain an even number of coins. We can move coins from one cell to an adjacent cell (horizontally or vertically) any number of times. The output format specifies that we should print the number of operations and the details of each operation.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1(x, y)`: This function seems to implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
   - `func_2(x4)`: This function recursively reduces a list of integers by applying `func_1` to the first two elements until only one element remains.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads dimensions of the grid and the subsequent coin counts in the cells.

3. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The logic of the program does not seem to relate to moving coins in a grid to maximize even counts. Instead, it is calculating the GCD of differences between elements in the input list. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize even counts of coins in the grid.

4. **Expected Output**:
   - The program outputs the result of `func_2(x3)`, which is a single integer rather than the specific movement operations as required by the problem.

### Potential Cases Where the Program Fails
- The program does not implement any logic to actually perform operations to move coins between cells.
- The output does not conform to the required format of showing the number of operations and the details of each operation.
- For any grid configuration, the program will not provide the expected output, as it does not perform any moves, nor does it track the coin distributions.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the required output format, it is clear that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not execute any coin-moving operations as specified, and it provides an output that does not satisfy the problem requirements.
