The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, where `x` represents the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid and `y` represents the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid, with constraints that 1 <= H, W <= 500 and 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for each cell (i, j) in the grid.

The function can return different values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If `x` is less than `y`, the function returns the non-negative integer `y`, representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid.
- Case_2: If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of `func_1` with parameters `y` and `(x % y)`.
- Case_3: If `x` is less than `y`, the function returns the non-negative integer `x`, representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid.
- Case_4: If `y` is greater than `x`, the function returns the result of `func_1` with parameters `x` and `(y % x)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and return different results based on their values, either returning `y`, computing a recursive call with modified parameters, or returning `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, and returns y if x < y; if x >= y and not divisible by y, it calls itself with parameters y and (x % y); if x < y, it returns x; if y > x, it calls itself with parameters x and (y % x).**
