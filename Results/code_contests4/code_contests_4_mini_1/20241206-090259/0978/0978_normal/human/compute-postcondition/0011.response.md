Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, which represent the number of rows and columns in a grid, respectively. It is designed to return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` and returns `y` if true. If not, it recursively calls itself with `y` and `x % y`. If `y` is greater than `x`, it checks if `y` is divisible by `x` and returns `x` if true. If not, it recursively calls itself with `x` and `y % x`. The function does not handle cases where either `x` or `y` is zero and does not explicitly return a result for such cases, even though the initial conditions state that both should be non-negative integers.**
