The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`. `x4` is a 2D list of integers representing a grid with H rows and W columns, with constraints that 1 <= H, W <= 500 and 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for each cell a_{ij}. The function has multiple return cases: 

- In Case 1, the function returns the result of applying `func_2` to a list that starts with the output of `func_1` applied to the first two rows of `x4`, followed by the remaining rows of `x4` from the third row onward.
- In Case 2, the function returns the result of applying `func_1` to the first and second rows of the 2D list `x4`.
- In Case 3, the function returns the first row of the 2D list `x4`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a 2D list `x4` of integers and return different results based on the number of rows in the list and the application of `func_1` on specific rows. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list x4 of integers representing a grid and returns different results depending on whether it applies func_1 to specific rows or returns the first row.**
