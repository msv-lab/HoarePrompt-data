The function accepts a 2D list `x4` representing a grid of integers and returns different results based on the number of rows in the grid. If there are more than two rows, it recursively applies `func_2` to a new list starting with the output of `func_1` applied to the first two rows of `x4`, followed by the remaining rows. If there are exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows. If there is only one row, it simply returns that row. The function does not handle the case where the input is an empty list, which could lead to an index error when accessing elements.
