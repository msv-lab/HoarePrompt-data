#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, y is a non-negative integer representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid, where 1 <= H, W <= 500. The grid contains integers a_{ij} such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for each cell (i, j) in the grid.
def func_1(x, y):
    if (x >= y) :
        if (x % y == 0) :
            return y
            #The program returns the non-negative integer representing the number of vertical columns (W) in the grid
        else :
            return func_1(y, x % y)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with parameters y and (x % y), where x is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to y and not divisible by y
    else :
        if (y % x == 0) :
            return x
            #The program returns the non-negative integer x representing the number of horizontal rows (H) in the grid, which is less than y
        else :
            return func_1(x, y % x)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with parameters x and (y % x), where y % x is the remainder of y divided by x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, which represent the number of rows and columns in a grid, respectively. It is designed to return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` and returns `y` if true. If not, it recursively calls itself with `y` and `x % y`. If `y` is greater than `x`, it checks if `y` is divisible by `x` and returns `x` if true. If not, it recursively calls itself with `x` and `y % x`. The function does not handle cases where either `x` or `y` is zero and does not explicitly return a result for such cases, even though the initial conditions state that both should be non-negative integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x4 is a 2D list of integers representing a grid with H rows and W columns, where 1 <= H, W <= 500 and 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for each cell a_{ij}.
def func_2(x4):
    if (len(x4) > 2) :
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
        #The program returns the result of applying func_2 to a list that starts with the output of func_1 applied to the first two rows of the grid x4, followed by the remaining rows of the grid x4 from the third row onward.
    else :
        if (len(x4) == 2) :
            return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
            #The program returns the result of applying func_1 to the first and second rows of the 2D list x4, where each row contains integers between 0 and 9.
        else :
            return x4[0]
            #The program returns the first row of the 2D list `x4`, which contains integers between 0 and 9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `x4` representing a grid of integers and returns different results based on the number of rows in the grid. If there are more than two rows, it recursively applies `func_2` to a new list starting with the output of `func_1` applied to the first two rows of `x4`, followed by the remaining rows. If there are exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows. If there is only one row, it simply returns that row. The function does not handle the case where the input is an empty list, which could lead to an index error when accessing elements.
