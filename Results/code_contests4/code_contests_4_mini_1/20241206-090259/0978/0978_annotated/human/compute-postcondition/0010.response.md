The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is a 2D list of integers representing a grid, where the dimensions of the grid are constrained to have between 1 and 500 rows and between 1 and 500 columns, and each element in the grid is an integer between 0 and 9. The parameter `y` is an integer representing the number of operations to perform, constrained to be between 0 and the total number of elements in the grid (H * W).

The function has several return cases:

- Case 1: If the value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and divisible by `y`, the function returns the integer `y`.
- Case 2: If the above condition is not met, the function returns the result of calling `func_1` with `y` and the remainder of the total sum of elements in grid `x` when divided by `y`.
- Case 3: If neither of the above conditions applies, the function returns the 2D list of integers representing the grid `x`.
- Case 4: Finally, if all previous cases are not fulfilled, the function returns the result of `func_1` with the grid `x` and the value `y` modulo the 2D list `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list `x` representing a grid of integers and an integer `y` representing the number of operations, and based on certain conditions, it returns either the integer `y`, a modified value based on the sum of the grid elements, the grid itself, or a modified result of calling `func_1` again with specific parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `x` and an integer `y`. It returns `y` if certain divisibility conditions are met; otherwise, it returns results based on the sum of grid elements, the grid itself, or a modified recursive call.**
