You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: x is a 2D list of integers representing the grid where 1 <= len(x) <= 500 (the number of rows H) and 1 <= len(x[0]) <= 500 (the number of columns W), and each element a_{ij} in the grid is an integer such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9. y is an integer representing the number of operations to perform, where 0 <= y <= H * W.
```
def func_1(x, y):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns the integer y, which represents the number of operations to perform, where 0 <= y <= H * W and the value of x is greater than or equal to y and divisible by y.

Case_2: The program returns the result of calling func_1 with y and the remainder of the total sum of elements in grid 'x' when divided by y

Case_3: The program returns the 2D list of integers representing the grid `x`, where 1 <= len(x) <= 500 (number of rows) and 1 <= len(x[0]) <= 500 (number of columns), with each element being an integer such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9.

Case_4: The program returns the result of func_1 with the grid 'x' and the value 'y' modulo the 2D list 'x'

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
