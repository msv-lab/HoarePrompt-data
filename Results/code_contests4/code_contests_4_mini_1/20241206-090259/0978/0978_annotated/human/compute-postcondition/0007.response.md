The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`. `x4` is a 2D list of integers representing a grid with `H` rows and `W` columns, where `1 <= H, W <= 500` and `0 <= a_{ij} <= 9` for each cell (i, j). 

After executing the function body, the return value depends on the cases:

- **Case 1**: The function returns the result of `func_2` applied to a list that includes the result of `func_1` applied to the first two rows of the grid `x4`, followed by the remaining rows from `x4` starting from the third row.
  
- **Case 2**: The function returns the result of the function `func_1` applied to the first row and the second row of the 2D list `x4`.

- **Case 3**: The function returns the first row of the 2D list `x4`, which is a list of integers representing the grid.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a 2D list of integers `x4` and return different values based on the specified cases involving the first two rows and the entire grid. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of integers `x4` and returns results based on the first two rows of the grid or just the first row, depending on the defined cases.**
