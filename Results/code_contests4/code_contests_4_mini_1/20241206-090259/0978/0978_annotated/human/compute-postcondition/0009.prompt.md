You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string, 'str' has 3 or more characters
```
eturn str
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns string 'str' that has 3 or more characters **


Example2:
Initial State: A is a matrix n x m
```
return A
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns the n x m sized matrix A**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
return n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the program returns either 4 or 6.
Output State: **The program returns 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is  greater than 3 , `z` is 0
```
retrun y+x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y' is 0 and 'x' is one so the program returns  0+1=1.
Output State: **`The program returns y that is greater than 3 plus 1**

xample4:
Initial State: `count' contains the number of numbers greater than 1 in the list `numbers`, 'numbers' is a list of integers, 'total' is 0
```
retrun count
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
Output State: **`The program returns the number of integers greater than 1 in list 'numbers' **


Your Task:
Initial State: *`x` is a 2D list of integers representing the grid where 1 <= len(x) <= 500 (the number of rows H) and 1 <= len(x[0]) <= 500 (the number of columns W), and each element a_{ij} in the grid is an integer such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9; `y` is an integer representing the number of operations to perform, where 0 <= y <= H * W; the value of `x` is less than `y`, and `y` is not a multiple of the sum of all elements in `x`.
```
return func_1(x, y % x)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
