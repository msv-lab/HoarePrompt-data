#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a 2D list of integers representing the grid where 1 <= len(x) <= 500 (the number of rows H) and 1 <= len(x[0]) <= 500 (the number of columns W), and each element a_{ij} in the grid is an integer such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9. y is an integer representing the number of operations to perform, where 0 <= y <= H * W.
def func_1(x, y):
    if (x >= y) :
        if (x % y == 0) :
            return y
            #The program returns the integer y, which represents the number of operations to perform, where 0 <= y <= H * W and the value of x is greater than or equal to y and divisible by y.
        else :
            return func_1(y, x % y)
            #The program returns the result of calling func_1 with y and the remainder of the total sum of elements in grid 'x' when divided by y
    else :
        if (y % x == 0) :
            return x
            #The program returns the 2D list of integers representing the grid `x`, where 1 <= len(x) <= 500 (number of rows) and 1 <= len(x[0]) <= 500 (number of columns), with each element being an integer such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9.
        else :
            return func_1(x, y % x)
            #The program returns the result of func_1 with the grid 'x' and the value 'y' modulo the 2D list 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `x` of integers and an integer `y`. It returns `y` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and divisible by `y`. If not, it recursively calls itself with `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. If `y` is greater than `x`, it returns `x` if `y` is divisible by `x`, otherwise it recursively calls itself with `x` and the remainder of `y` divided by `x`. This function essentially implements a variant of the Euclidean algorithm but is incorrectly described in the annotations regarding the return values based on grid operations. The code does not utilize the grid's elements at all, which is a significant omission in the functionality description.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x4 is a 2D list of integers representing a grid with H rows and W columns, where 1 <= H, W <= 500 and 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9 for each cell (i, j).
def func_2(x4):
    if (len(x4) > 2) :
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
        #The program returns the result of func_2 applied to a list that includes the result of func_1 applied to the first two rows of the grid x4, followed by the remaining rows from x4 starting from the third row
    else :
        if (len(x4) == 2) :
            return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
            #The program returns the result of the function func_1 applied to the first row and the second row of the 2D list x4, which contains integers between 0 and 9.
        else :
            return x4[0]
            #The program returns the first row of the 2D list `x4`, which is a list of integers representing the grid.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers `x4`. If `x4` has more than two rows, it applies `func_1` to the first two rows and recursively calls itself with the result and the remaining rows. If `x4` has exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows. If `x4` has only one row, it returns that row directly. The function effectively reduces the grid row by row until it processes all elements or returns the first row.
