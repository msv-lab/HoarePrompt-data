The function accepts a 2D list of integers `x4`. If `x4` has more than two rows, it applies `func_1` to the first two rows and recursively calls itself with the result and the remaining rows. If `x4` has exactly two rows, it returns the result of `func_1` applied to those two rows. If `x4` has only one row, it returns that row directly. The function effectively reduces the grid row by row until it processes all elements or returns the first row.
