x is a 2D list of integers representing the grid where 1 <= len(x) <= 500 (the number of rows H) and 1 <= len(x[0]) <= 500 (the number of columns W), and each element a_{ij} in the grid is an integer such that 0 <= a_{ij} <= 9. y is an integer representing the number of operations to perform, where 0 <= y <= H * W.
