Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the functionality required by the problem description. Specifically, the task is to maximize the number of cells with an even number of coins by moving coins between adjacent cells. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform any operations related to the grid's elements or the movement of coins. Instead, they seem to implement a variant of the Euclidean algorithm, which is unrelated to the problem at hand.

In particular, `func_1` and `func_2` do not utilize the grid to compute the necessary operations, nor do they generate the required output format of moving coins between cells. The annotations indicate a misunderstanding of the operations needed, as they describe returning integers or rows rather than the operations to move coins as specified in the problem.

For example, the task requires outputting a sequence of operations that maximizes cells with an even number of coins, but the functions do not provide any such operations or logic to achieve this. Hence, the program fails to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description for any input case. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
