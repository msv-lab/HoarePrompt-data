According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `p`. If the list has more words, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `p`, and `num` contains the integer value of `i` appended to it. 

Since `i` is the first word of the list, for the loop to execute one more time, `p` must have at least 2 words, and `i` will take the second word in the list during the next iteration. The loop will continue until all words in the list have been processed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration, `p` is a list containing at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `p`, and `num` now contains the integer value of `i` appended to it.**
