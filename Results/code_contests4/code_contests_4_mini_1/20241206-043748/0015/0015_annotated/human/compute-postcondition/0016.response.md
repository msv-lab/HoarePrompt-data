The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on predefined constraints where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of citizens in the city, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the number of wizards (with the constraint that 0 <= x <= n), and `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration (with the constraint that 1 <= y <= 10^4). 

The function returns different outputs based on the relationships between these values. 

1. Case_1: If the number of wizards `x` is less than the percentage required `y` of the total citizens `n`, the function returns a message indicating that there are not enough wizards for the demonstration.
2. Case_2: If the number of wizards `x` meets or exceeds the percentage required `y` of the total citizens `n`, the function returns a message indicating that there are enough wizards for the demonstration.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to assess whether the number of wizards in relation to the total number of citizens meets the required percentage for a demonstration and return an appropriate message based on that assessment.

Functionality: **The function evaluates the number of wizards against the required percentage of citizens and returns a message indicating if there are enough wizards for the demonstration.**
