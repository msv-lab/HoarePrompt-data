The variable `i` is assigned the value of the first word in the list `p`. The code appends the integer value of `i` to the list `num`. The initial state indicates that `i` is the first word in `p`, and the code converts `i` to an integer before appending it. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of the integer value of `i` to the list `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer (0 <= x <= n), `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration (1 <= y <= 10^4), `p` is a list containing at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `p`, and `num` now contains the integer value of `i` appended to it.**
