According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. For the loop to execute at least once, `p` must contain at least one word. The current states of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `num` do not directly influence the execution of the loop. However, since `num` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop's ability to execute. 

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `p` is a list that contains at least one element. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `p` must have at least one word, and the loop variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `p`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer (0 <= x <= n), `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration (1 <= y <= 10^4), for the loop to execute the first time `p` is a list containing at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list `p`.**
