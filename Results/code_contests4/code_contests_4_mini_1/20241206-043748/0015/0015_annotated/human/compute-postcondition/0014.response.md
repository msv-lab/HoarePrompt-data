The code prints the value of `int(y) + 1`. The value of `y` is derived from the expression `(num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]`, and since it is given that `y` is not an integer, `int(y)` will truncate the decimal part of `y`. Thus, the output will be one more than the integer part of `y`.

Since `y` is not an integer, `int(y)` will be less than `y`, leading to the final output being `int(y) + 1`, which is the next integer greater than the integer part of `y`.

Output State: **`num` contains the integer values of all words in `p`; `p` is a list of words; `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial states; `y` is assigned the value of (num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]; `y` is not an integer (y % 1 â‰  0); print(int(y) + 1 results in an integer greater than int(y).**
