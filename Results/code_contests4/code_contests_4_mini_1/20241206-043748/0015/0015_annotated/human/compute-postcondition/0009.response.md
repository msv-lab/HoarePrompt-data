The loop iterates over each word in the list `p`, converting each word to an integer and appending it to the list `num`. After the loop has executed for all the iterations, `num` will contain the integer values of all the words present in `p`. If `p` is empty, the loop will not execute and `num` will remain an empty list.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `num` contains all the integer values converted from the words in the list `p`, and `p` is a list of words that were processed.

Output State: **`num` contains the integer values of all words in `p`, `p` is a list of words, and `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial states.**
