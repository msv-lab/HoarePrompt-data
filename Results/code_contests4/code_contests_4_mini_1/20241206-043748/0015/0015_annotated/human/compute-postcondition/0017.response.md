Functionality: ** The function accepts input for the number of citizens, the number of wizards, and the required percentage for a demonstration. It calculates the number of additional wizards needed based on the formula (n * y / 100) - x, where n is the number of citizens, x is the number of wizards, and y is the required percentage. If the result is an integer, it prints that value; if it is not, it prints the next higher integer. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. It does not handle any edge cases for invalid input or negative values for the parameters, assuming all inputs are valid as per the initial conditions stated.**
