`num` is a list that will have the integer value of `i` appended to it. The previous value of `i` is the second word in the list `p`, which is a string. The `int(i)` converts this string to an integer, and this integer is added to the `num` list. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration, `p` is a list containing at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `p`, and `num` now contains the integer value of `i` appended to it.
