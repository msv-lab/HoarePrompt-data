Postcondition: ***`num` contains the integer values of all words in `p`; `p` is a list of words; `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial states; `y` is assigned the value of (num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]. If `y` is an integer, the output is the integer value of `y` printed. If `y` is not an integer (y % 1 â‰  0), the program prints the result of int(y) + 1, which is an integer greater than int(y).***
