The variable `p` is assigned the value of `c.split()`, which splits the input string `c` into a list of words based on whitespace. The values of the other variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of citizens in the city, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the number of wizards (0 <= x <= n), `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration (1 <= y <= 10^4), and `p` is a list of words obtained from the string `c`.
