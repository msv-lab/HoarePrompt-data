According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. If `p` contains more words, the loop can execute again for the next word in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second word in the list `p`. Since `p` contains at least 2 words, the current index of `i` is 1, corresponding to the second word. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the third word in the list `p`, and `num` must be updated with the integer value of this new `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration, `p` is a list containing at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `p`, `num` now contains the integer value of `i` appended to it.**
