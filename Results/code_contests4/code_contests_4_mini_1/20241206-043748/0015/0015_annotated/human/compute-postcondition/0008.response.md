The value of `i` is the third word in the list `p`, and `num` is a list that now receives an integer value which is the integer conversion of `i`. The list `num` is appended with this new integer value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration, `p` is a list containing at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `p`, and `num` now contains the integer value of `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer representing the percentage required for the demonstration, `p` is a list containing at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `p`, `num` now contains the integer value of `i` appended to it.**
