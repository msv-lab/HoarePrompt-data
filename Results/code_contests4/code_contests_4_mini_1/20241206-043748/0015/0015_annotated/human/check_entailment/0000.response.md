The provided program attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of clones needed for a demonstration based on the number of citizens (`n`), the number of wizards (`x`), and the required percentage (`y`). 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single line of input, splits it into components, and converts them into integers. This part is appropriate for the problem requirements.

2. **Calculation**: The core calculation is done with the formula:
   \[
   \text{additional\_clones} = \frac{n \cdot y}{100} - x
   \]
   This formula correctly identifies how many more participants (clones) are necessary to meet the required percentage of the total population.

3. **Rounding Logic**: The program checks if the result of the calculation is an integer. If it is, it prints that value directly. If it is not, it adds 1 to the integer part of the result. This rounding up is necessary because even a fraction of a person in terms of percentage requires a full clone, which aligns with the requirement that the demonstration must meet or exceed the necessary number of participants.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the number of additional clones needed, which is required by the problem description.

### Validation Against Problem Description:
- The program correctly interprets the input values according to the problem description.
- The calculation performed matches the expected formula to determine the number of clones needed.
- The logic for rounding up ensures that even slight deficiencies in meeting the percentage requirement are covered.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle cases where `y` is more than 100% properly in terms of logic since the calculation itself would still work mathematically. However, the problem description states that the administration can ask for more than 100%, which is correctly handled by the formula as well.
- All inputs are assumed to be valid based on the constraints defined in the problem description, so the lack of input validation is acceptable given the problem scope.

Overall, the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
