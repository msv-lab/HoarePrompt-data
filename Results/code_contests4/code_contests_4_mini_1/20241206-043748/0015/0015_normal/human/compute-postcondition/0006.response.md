The code attempts to append the integer value of `i` into `num`. However, `num` is described as an integer variable, which cannot have the method `append` applied to it, as `append` is a method used for lists. Therefore, the operation cannot be completed, and there is no change in the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second substring in `p`; `num` is an integer and cannot append `int(i)` as it is not a list.**
