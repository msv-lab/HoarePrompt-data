To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider how the loop processes the list `p`. The loop iterates over each substring in `p`, converting each substring into an integer and appending it to the list `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `x`, `y` ≤ 10,000, and `x` ≤ `n`
- `p` is a list of substrings derived from the input string `c`
- `num` is an empty list

The loop processes each element of `p` and appends the integer representations of those elements to `num`. 

After the loop:
- If `p` contains `k` substrings, then `num` will contain `k` integer values corresponding to those substrings.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The list `p` retains the original substrings that were derived from `c`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` contains the integer values of all substrings in `p`.**
