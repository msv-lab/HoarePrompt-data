According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `p`. If the list has at least 2 substrings, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first substring in `p`, and since `p` has at least 1 element, we can deduce that `i` corresponds to this element. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be updated to the second substring in `p`. Therefore, for it to execute one more time, `p` must contain at least 2 substrings.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second substring in `p`; `num` now contains the integer value of `i`.**
