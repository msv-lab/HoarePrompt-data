Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is updated based on the calculation involving `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]`; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` contains the integer values of all substrings in `p`; `y` is not an integer, and `int(y) + 1` is printed, indicating that the output will be the integer value of `y` plus 1.**
