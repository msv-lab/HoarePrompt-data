The variable `i` is assigned the value of the first substring in the list `p`. The code appends the integer value of `i` (converted from a substring) to the list `num`. Since `i` is the first substring in `p`, the contents of `num` will now include this integer value. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 1 element; `i` is the first substring in `p`; `num` now contains the integer value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 1 element; `i` is the first substring in `p`; `num` now contains the integer value of `i`.**
