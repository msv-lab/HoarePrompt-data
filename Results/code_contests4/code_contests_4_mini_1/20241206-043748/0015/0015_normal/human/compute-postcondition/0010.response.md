To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the operation step by step:

1. The variable `num` contains integer values derived from the list `p`. The specific values of `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]` are crucial to the calculation, but they are not specified in the initial state.
2. The formula calculates a new value for `y` as follows:
   - It multiplies `num[0]` by `num[2]`.
   - It then divides the result by `100.0` (which ensures the division is in floating-point).
   - Finally, it subtracts `num[1]` from the result of the division.

Since `num` contains integer values and the operations involve straightforward arithmetic, we can express the output state in terms of the variables involved.

However, without specific values for `num`, we can only represent the output state in a general form. Thus, the output state reflects the operation but not the concrete values due to lack of specification.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is updated based on the calculation involving `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]`; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` contains the integer values of all substrings in `p`.**
