The code `num.append(int(i))` appends the integer value of `i` to the list `num`. The variable `i` is the third substring in the list `p`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation, and the state of `num` is updated by adding the integer representation of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third substring in `p`; `num` is updated by appending the integer value of `i`.**
