The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it operates based on the constraints provided for the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 10,000, and x ≤ n. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return value or behavior of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates based on the constraints of integers n, x, and y, and the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
