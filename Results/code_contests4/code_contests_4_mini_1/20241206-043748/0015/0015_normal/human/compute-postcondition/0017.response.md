Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to consist of three space-separated integers. It calculates a value `y` based on the formula `(num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]`. The function prints `y` as an integer if it is a whole number; otherwise, it prints the integer value of `y` incremented by 1. The function does not return any value, and the potential edge cases include handling of input that does not conform to the expected format or values outside the specified range. **
