According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. For the loop to execute, the list `p` must contain at least one substring (i.e., it must not be empty). Given that `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers within the specified range, they do not directly affect the execution of the loop in this context. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed for the first time, the `num` list remains empty, and `i` will be the first element of the list `p` if it exists. Thus, we need to ensure that `p` is not empty, and if it has at least one element, `i` should be initialized to the first substring in `p`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000, `p` is a list of substrings with at least 1 element, `i` is the first substring in `p`, `num` is an empty list**
