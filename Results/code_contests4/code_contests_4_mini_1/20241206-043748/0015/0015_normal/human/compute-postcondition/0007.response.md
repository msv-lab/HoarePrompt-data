According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. If the list `p` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second substring in `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must have at least 3 elements, `i` must now be the third substring in `p`, and the index would be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10,000; `p` is a list of substrings with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third substring in `p`.**
