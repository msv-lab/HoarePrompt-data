Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000; `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`; `y` is updated based on the calculation involving `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]`; `p` is a list of substrings; `num` contains the integer values of all substrings in `p`. If `y` is an integer, it is printed as is. Otherwise, the output will be `int(y) + 1`, which indicates that the integer value of `y` will be incremented by 1 before printing.***
