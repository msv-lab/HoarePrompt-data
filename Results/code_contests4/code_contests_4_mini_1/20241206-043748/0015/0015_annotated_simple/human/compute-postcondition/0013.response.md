Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is the result of the calculation, `p` is a list of substrings, `num` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `p`, `i` is the last element in `p` if `p` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined. The value of `y` is not an integer (i.e., `y` is not equal to any integer value).***
