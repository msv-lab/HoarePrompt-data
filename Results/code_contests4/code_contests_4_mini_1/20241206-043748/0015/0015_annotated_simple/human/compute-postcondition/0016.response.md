The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on the constraints that `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers with the following conditions: 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 10^4, and x ≤ n. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the given constraints alone. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates with integers n, x, and y under the constraints that 1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 10^4 and x ≤ n. The return value is unspecified.**
