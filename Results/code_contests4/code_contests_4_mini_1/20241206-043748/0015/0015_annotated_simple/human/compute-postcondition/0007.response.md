According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. If `p` has at least 3 substrings, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has at least 2 substrings, and `i` is the second element in `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must have at least 3 substrings, and `i` will take the value of the third element in `p`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `p` is a list of substrings with at least 3 substrings, `num` is a list containing the integer value of the first element in `p` and the integer value of `i`, `i` is the third element in `p`**
