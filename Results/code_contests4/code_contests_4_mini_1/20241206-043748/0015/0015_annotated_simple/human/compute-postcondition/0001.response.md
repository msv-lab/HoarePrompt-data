The variable `p` is assigned the result of `c.split()`, which splits the string `c` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, as the operation affects only the variable `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `x`, `y` ≤ 10^4, `x` ≤ `n`; `p` is a list of substrings from the string `c`.

Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `x`, `y` ≤ 10^4, `x` ≤ `n`; `p` is a list of substrings from the string `c`.**
