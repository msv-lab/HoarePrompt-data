The value of `i` is converted to an integer and then appended to the list `num`. Since `num` is a list that initially contains the integer value of the first element in `p`, after executing the code, it will contain this integer value plus the integer value of `i`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `p`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `p` is a list of substrings with at least 2 substrings, `num` is a list containing the integer value of the first element in `p` and the integer value of `i`, `i` is the second element in `p`**
