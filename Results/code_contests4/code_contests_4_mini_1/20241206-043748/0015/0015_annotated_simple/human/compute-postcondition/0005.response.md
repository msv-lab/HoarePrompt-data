According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `p`. Since `p` contains at least 1 substring, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must have at least 2 substrings. The variable `i` will be updated to the next element in `p`. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `p` is a list of substrings with at least 2 substrings, `num` is a list containing the integer value of the first element in `p`, `i` is the second element in `p`**
