The variable `num` is assigned an empty list. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `p` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `x`, `y` ≤ 10^4, `x` ≤ `n`; `p` is a list of substrings from the string `c`; `num` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `x`, `y` ≤ 10^4, `x` ≤ `n`; `p` is a list of substrings from the string `c`; `num` is an empty list.**
