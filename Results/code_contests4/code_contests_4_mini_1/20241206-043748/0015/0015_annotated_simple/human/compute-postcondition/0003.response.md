According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `p`. For the loop to execute, the list must contain at least one substring. Given that `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers and `p` is a list of substrings, we need to ensure that `p` is not empty. 

At the beginning of the loop:
- The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in the list `p` during each iteration.
- Since `num` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution but can be used within the loop's body.

For the loop to execute at least once, `p` must contain at least one substring. Therefore, we need to specify that `p` is a list with at least one substring.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `p` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `num` is an empty list, and `i` is the first element in `p`**.
