The code attempts to convert `y` to an integer using `int(y)` and then adds 1 to that value. However, it is provided that `y` is not an integer, which will result in an error during execution. Therefore, the output state will indicate that the operation could not be completed due to the type of `y`.

Output State: **Error: Cannot convert `y` to an integer as it is not an integer.**
