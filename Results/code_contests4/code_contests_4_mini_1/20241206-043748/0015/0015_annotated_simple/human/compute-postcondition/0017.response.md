Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user, which consists of three integers (n, x, y) separated by spaces. It calculates a value `y` based on the formula `(num[0] * num[2]) / 100 - num[1]`, where `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]` correspond to the integers n, x, and y respectively. If the calculated value `y` is an integer, it prints that integer; otherwise, it prints the next higher integer. The function does not return any value, and it lacks parameter acceptance as it relies on user input directly. It also assumes that the input will always be valid integers within the specified constraints.**
