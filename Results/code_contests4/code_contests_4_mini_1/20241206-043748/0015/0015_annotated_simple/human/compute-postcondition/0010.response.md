The value of `y` is calculated using the expression `float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]`. This means that `y` will take the product of the first and third elements of the list `num`, convert that product to a float, divide it by 100, and then subtract the second element of `num`. The value of `n`, `x`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculated value of `y` based on the provided values in `num`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is the result of the calculation, `p` is a list of substrings, `num` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `p`, `i` is the last element in `p` if `p` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined.**
