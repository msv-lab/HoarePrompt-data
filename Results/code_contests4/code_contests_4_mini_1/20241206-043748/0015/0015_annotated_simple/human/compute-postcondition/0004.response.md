`num` is updated by appending the integer conversion of `i`, which is the first element in the list `p`. The previous state of `num` is an empty list, so after execution, `num` will contain one element, which is the integer value of `i`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `p` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `num` is a list containing the integer value of the first element in `p`, and `i` is the first element in `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `p` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `num` is a list containing the integer value of the first element in `p`, `i` is the first element in `p`**
