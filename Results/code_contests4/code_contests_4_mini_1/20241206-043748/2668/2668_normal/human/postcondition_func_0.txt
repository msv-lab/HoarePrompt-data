The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of lists `lis1`, a positive integer `low`, and a positive integer `high`. It performs a binary search on `lis1` to find a sublist where the first element matches `num`. If found, it returns `True` along with the second element of the found sublist; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1. The function assumes that `lis1` is structured such that it contains sublists where the first element is an integer, and the list is indexed properly for the binary search to work correctly. Edge cases include situations where `low` exceeds `high` without finding a match, leading to a return value of `False` and -1. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `low` or `high` are out of bounds of the list `lis1`, which could result in index errors.
