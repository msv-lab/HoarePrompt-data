The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
