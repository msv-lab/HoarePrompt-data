Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of `func_1` for the last element of `uniques`. If `back[0]` is truthy, then `res` is True if at least one call to `func_1` returned a truthy first element in `back`. The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last successful condition if it was met; otherwise, it holds the value from the last iteration. The list `templis` remains unchanged and contains tuples of (subs[y], y + 1). The list `subs` contains at least 0 elements, `uniques` contains at least 1 element, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1` if the loop executed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
