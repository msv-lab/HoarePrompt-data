The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the initial state doesn't provide any information about being inside a loop, the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the output state reflects that we remain in the same context without any modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `init` and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
