Postcondition: ***`res` is False initially, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, and `i` is 0. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is updated to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `back[0]` is not True, the values of `res`, `uniques`, `i`, and `back` remain unchanged.***
