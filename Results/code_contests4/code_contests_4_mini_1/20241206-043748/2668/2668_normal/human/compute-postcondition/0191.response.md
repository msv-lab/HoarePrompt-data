Postcondition: ***`res` is True if `back[0]` is True, indicating that the condition is met, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. If `back[0]` is False, then `res` remains False, `uniques` still contains at least 1 element, and `i` remains 1, with no change to `anss`.***
