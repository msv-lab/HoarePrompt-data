Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`, `subs` has at least `len(subs)` elements.**
