The code appends a tuple to the list `templis`. The tuple consists of the element at index `y` of the list `subs` and the value `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 2, the code will access the third element of `subs` (since indexing starts at 0) and append it with the value 3 to `templis`. The value of `back`, `res`, and `anss` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`back` is a list with the first element being truthy, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `subs` is a list with at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, and a tuple of (subs[2], 3) is appended to `templis`.**
