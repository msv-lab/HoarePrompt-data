According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `uniques` list. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `uniques`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `uniques` contains at least 1 element, it must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute a second time. Therefore, in this case, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`res` is True if `back[0]` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`**
