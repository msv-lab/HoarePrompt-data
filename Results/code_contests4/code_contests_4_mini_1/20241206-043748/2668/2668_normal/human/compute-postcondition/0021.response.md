The code appends a tuple to the `counts` list. The first element of the tuple is calculated as `counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1`, which is the first element of the last tuple in `counts` incremented by 1. The second element of the tuple is `init[i]`, where `i` is 1, so it refers to the second element of the `init` list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed except for the addition to the `counts` list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `init`, and a new tuple is appended to `counts` with the first element being incremented from the last tuple in `counts` and the second element being `init[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `init`, and a new tuple is appended to `counts` with the first element being incremented from the last tuple in `counts` and the second element being `init[i]`.**
