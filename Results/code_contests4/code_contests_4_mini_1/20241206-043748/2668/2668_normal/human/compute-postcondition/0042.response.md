Output State: **`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `uniques` now contains three instances of the first tuple from `counts` and one instance of the second tuple from `counts`, `i` is 1, `x` is the second tuple in `counts` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
