The code initializes an empty list `templis`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged as no other variable is modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the initial state and the new initialization of `templis`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is an empty list.**
