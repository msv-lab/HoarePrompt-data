Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains all pairs (subs[y], y + 1) for which audio[y][0] is equal to uniques[i][1], `subs` has at least 0 elements, `y` is less than len(subs), `z` is 0. If the first element of `back` is True, then `res` remains True, `anss` is now equal to `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `res` or `anss`.***
