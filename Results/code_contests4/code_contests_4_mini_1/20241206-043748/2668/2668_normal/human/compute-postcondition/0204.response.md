Postcondition: ***`res` is a boolean indicating whether a truthy value was found; if `res` is True, `anss` remains unchanged or contains the result from the last successful call to `func_1`, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, and `i` is equal to the length of `uniques`. If `res` is False, `anss` remains unchanged, `uniques` is still a list with at least 1 element, `i` equals the length of `uniques`, and `output` is set to 1.***
