The code appends a tuple consisting of the value of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` to the list `templis`. The initial state indicates that `y` is 0, so `y + 1` is 1. The value `subs[y]` refers to the first element of `subs`, as `y` is 0. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `templis` is updated to include the tuple `(subs[0], 1)`, and the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is updated to include (subs[0], 1), `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]**
