According to the code, the loop execution is dependent on the `subs` list. If `subs` has at least 2 elements at the end of the last iteration, it can execute again for the next value of `y`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `y` must be incremented to 2, and `subs` should have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `subs` has at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, and `templis` now includes the tuple `(subs[2], 2)` if `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
