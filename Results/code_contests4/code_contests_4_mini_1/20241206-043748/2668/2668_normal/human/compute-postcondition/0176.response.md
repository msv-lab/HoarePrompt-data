Postcondition: ***`res` is False, `anss` contains the result from the last successful call to `func_1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` is equal to the last `uniques[i][1]` processed, `subs` has at least 0 elements, `uniques` is a sorted list of unique tuples, and the loop executed at least once if `uniques` contains at least 1 element.***
