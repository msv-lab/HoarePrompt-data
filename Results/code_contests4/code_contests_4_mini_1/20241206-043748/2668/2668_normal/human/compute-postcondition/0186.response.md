According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `uniques` list. If `i` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `uniques` has at least 1 element, meaning the length of `uniques` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The loop will execute again if the length of `uniques` is greater than 1.

State: **`res` is False initially, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `uniques` must have at least 2 elements.**
