According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the length of the `uniques` list. If `z` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` was assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, and `z` must be updated for the next iteration. 

Since `z` is incremented by 1 with each iteration, if it was `1` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `2` at the start of this iteration. For the loop to execute once more, `z` must be less than the length of `uniques`, and thus the loop will execute while `z` is 2, provided the length of `uniques` is greater than 2.

State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, for the loop to execute a second time `uniques` must have at least 3 elements, and `z` is 2.**
