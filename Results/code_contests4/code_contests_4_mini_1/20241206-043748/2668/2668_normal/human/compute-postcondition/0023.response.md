Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `init`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, a new tuple is appended to `counts` with the first element being incremented from the last tuple in `counts` and the second element being `init[i]`. Otherwise, `counts` now includes the tuple (1, init[1]).***
