Postcondition: ***`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[0][1]`; `subs` has at least `len(subs)` elements; `uniques` has at least 1 element; `z` is 0; and the first element of `back` is True.***
