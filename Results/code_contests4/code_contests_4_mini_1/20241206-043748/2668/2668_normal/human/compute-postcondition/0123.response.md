The variable `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The previous value of `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 1, len(templis) - 1)` but is now overwritten. The value of `res` remains True, and `anss` will be updated to the new value of `back`. 

If the first element of `back` is True, then `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, the specific return value of `func_1` is not known.

Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and if the first element of `back` is True, then `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and if the first element of `back` is True, then `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
