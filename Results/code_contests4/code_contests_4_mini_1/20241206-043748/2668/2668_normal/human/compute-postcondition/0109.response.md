The code appends a tuple consisting of the value of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` to the list `templis`. Given the initial state where `y` is 1, this means `subs[1]` is accessed. The value of `subs` must be checked to ensure it has at least 2 elements, which is stated in the setup for the loop to execute a second time. The value of `y + 1` will be 2.

The other variables (`back`, `res`, and `anss`) are not affected by this operation, so their previous values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, and `templis` now includes the tuple `(subs[1], 2)`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, and `templis` now includes the tuple `(subs[1], 2)`.**
