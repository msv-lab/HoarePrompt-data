The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains all pairs (subs[y], y + 1) for which audio[y][0] is equal to uniques[i][1]; `subs` has at least 0 elements; `y` is less than len(subs); `z` is 1; `uniques` has at least 2 elements and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
