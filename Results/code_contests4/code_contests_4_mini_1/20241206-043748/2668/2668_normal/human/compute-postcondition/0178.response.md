The variable `subs` is assigned the value of `sorted(subs)`, which means that the tuples within `subs` will be sorted based on the first element of each tuple (the original subs value). The other variables `res`, `anss`, and `templis` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorting of `subs` while keeping the other variables the same.

Output State: **`res` is False, `anss` contains the result from the last successful call to `func_1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)`, and `subs` is sorted.**
