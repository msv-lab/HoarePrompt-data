The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `anss` is equal to `back`, where `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`.
