Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` now contains the first tuple from `counts`, `i` is 0, `x` is the first tuple in `counts`, and `i + 1` is equal to the length of `counts`. The second element of the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is not equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `counts`.***
