The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
