The variable `res` is assigned the value `True`, which changes its previous value from `False` to `True`. The other variables, `uniques`, `i`, and `back`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is `True`, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `back` is assigned the value from `func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)` with the first element of `back` being `True`.

Output State: **`res` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `back` is assigned the value from func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1), and the first element of `back` is True.**
