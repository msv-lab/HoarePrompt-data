The value of `output` is set to 1 if `res` is False, as stated in the initial conditions. The code then writes the string representation of `output` to standard output. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a boolean indicating whether a truthy value was found; `anss` remains unchanged; `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` equals the length of `uniques`; `output` is 1, and the file 'output.txt' does not exist.
