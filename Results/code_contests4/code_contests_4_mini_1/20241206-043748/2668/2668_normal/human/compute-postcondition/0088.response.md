The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `res` remains True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
