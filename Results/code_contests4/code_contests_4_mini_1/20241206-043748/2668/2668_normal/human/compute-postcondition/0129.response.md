The value of `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. Since `z` is 2, we are accessing `uniques[2][1]`. The values of `templis` and the result of `func_1` are not specified, so `back` will hold the value returned by `func_1` using `uniques[2][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1` as arguments. The previous values of `res` and `anss` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`**.
