Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `init`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, the last tuple in `counts` has its first element incremented by 1 and `init[i]` is appended to `counts`. Otherwise, the tuple (1, init[2]) is appended to `counts`.***
