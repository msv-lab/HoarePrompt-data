The variable `templis` is initialized as an empty list. This code does not affect any previously defined variables. The values of `back`, `res`, and `anss` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is an empty list.
