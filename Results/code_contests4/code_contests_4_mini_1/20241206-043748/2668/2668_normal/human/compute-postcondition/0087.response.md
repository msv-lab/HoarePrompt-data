The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which was previously assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The value of `back` is retained, and the other variables (`res` and `anss`) are affected accordingly. Since `res` remains True, it does not change. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1); `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `res` remains True.**
