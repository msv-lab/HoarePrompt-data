The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[0][1]`, `subs` has at least `len(subs)` elements, `uniques` has at least 1 element, `z` is 0, the first element of `back` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
