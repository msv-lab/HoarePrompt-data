The value of `back` is assigned the result of the function `func_1` with parameters `uniques[1][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. The values of `templis`, `subs`, and `uniques` were already defined, but their specific values are not provided. The variable `res` remains True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Thus, the output state reflects the assignment to `back` and `anss`, along with the unchanged values of `res`. 

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1); `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
