The variable `uniques` is modified by appending the value of `counts[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the third tuple in `counts` will be added to `uniques`. The previous state of `uniques` will now include one additional tuple from `counts`, specifically `counts[2]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `uniques` now contains an additional instance of `counts[2]`, `i` is 2, `x` is the third tuple in `counts`.**
