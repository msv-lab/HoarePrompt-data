The value of `init` is reassigned to be the sorted version of itself in reverse order. The previous state of `init` is a list of integers based on the input line, but the specific integers are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `init` has been sorted in descending order, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input.readline())`; `init` is sorted in reverse order.**
