The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, `a`, which is a list of `n` positive integers, `m`, which is a positive integer, `b`, which is a list of `m` positive integers, and `c`, which is a list of `m` positive integers. The constraints specify that for each movie `j`, the values in list `b` and list `c` must not be equal (i.e., `b[j] â‰  c[j]`). The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the given conditions.

However, the specific output of the function is not provided. Therefore, based on the parameters alone, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), a (a list of n positive integers), m (a positive integer), b (a list of m positive integers), and c (a list of m positive integers). It ensures that for each movie j, the elements in b and c are not equal.**
