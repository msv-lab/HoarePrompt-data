According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `uniques`. If `i` is less than `len(uniques)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`, which indicates that it has executed for the last element of `uniques`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it equal to `len(uniques)`. However, since `i` cannot be less than `len(uniques)` for the loop to run again, it will not execute. 

State: **`back` is the result of `func_1` for the last element of `uniques`, `i` is equal to `len(uniques)`, for the loop to execute again `len(uniques)` must be greater than `len(uniques)` which is not possible.**
