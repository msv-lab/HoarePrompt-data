Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element of `init`. If `i` is equal to 0, the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, the program does not specify any further action.***
