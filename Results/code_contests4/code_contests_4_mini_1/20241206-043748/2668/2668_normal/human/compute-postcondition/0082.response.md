The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of func_1 with parameters (uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1); `res` is True; `anss` is now the same as `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples of (subs[y], y + 1); `subs` is a list with at least 0 elements; `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element; `z` is 0; the first element of `back` is True; `res` remains True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
