According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the `init` list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is the second element of `init`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `init`.

Since `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, the length of `init` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Thus, after the current iteration where `i` is 1, `i` will become 2, and `x` will be the third element of `init`. The loop will execute a third time as long as `i` is less than the length of `init` (which is at least 2). 

State: **`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `init`.**
