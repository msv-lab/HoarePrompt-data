Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, and `counts` is a list of at least 3 tuples. If `i + 1` equals the length of `counts`, then `uniques` contains an additional instance of `counts[2]`, and `i` remains 2 with `x` being the third tuple in `counts`, after which the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
