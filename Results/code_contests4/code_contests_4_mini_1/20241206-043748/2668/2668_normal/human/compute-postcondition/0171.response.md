Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains all pairs (subs[y], y + 1) for which audio[y][0] is equal to uniques[i][1], `subs` has at least 0 elements, `y` is less than len(subs), `z` is 2, and `uniques` has at least 3 elements. If `back[0]` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
