Postcondition: ***`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, and `templis` now includes the tuple `(subs[1], 2)` if `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.***
