Output State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)` for the last index `z` where `back[0]` is True; `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the iterations, otherwise it remains unchanged; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` at the last iteration where `back[0]` was True; `templis` contains all pairs (subs[y], y + 1) for which audio[y][0] is equal to uniques[i][1]; `subs` has at least 0 elements; `y` is less than len(subs); `uniques` has at least `len(uniques)` elements.**
