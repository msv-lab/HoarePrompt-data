According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `subs` list. If `subs` has at least 1 element, the loop is set to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop will only execute again if `subs` has at least 2 elements since the range of the loop is determined by the length of `subs`.

State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is updated to include (subs[0], 1), `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
