Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `init`. If `i` is equal to 0, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the program continues without any change in state as there is no else part.***
