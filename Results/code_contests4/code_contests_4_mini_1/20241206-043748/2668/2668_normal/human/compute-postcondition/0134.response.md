Output State: **`back` is the result of `func_1` called with the last element of `uniques` processed, `res` is True if at least one of the calls to `func_1` returned a truthy first element, `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last successful call if `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)` for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` is equal to the last `uniques[z][1]` processed, `subs` has at least `len(subs)` elements, `uniques` has at least `len(uniques)` elements, and `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`.**
