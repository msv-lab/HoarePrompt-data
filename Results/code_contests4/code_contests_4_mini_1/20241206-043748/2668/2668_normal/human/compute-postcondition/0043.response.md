Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `uniques` now contains three instances of the first tuple from `counts` and one instance of the second tuple from `counts`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second tuple in `counts`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `counts`.***
