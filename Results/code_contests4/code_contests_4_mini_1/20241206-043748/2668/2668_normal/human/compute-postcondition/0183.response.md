The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Since the first element of `back` is True and the assignment does not change any other variables, the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `back` is a value where the first element is True, and `anss` is assigned the same value as `back`.

Output State: **`res` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `back` has first element True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`**.
