The variable `audio2` is assigned the value of `sorted(audio)`, which means it will contain the elements of the list `audio` sorted in ascending order. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new variable created.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples, `uniques` is the sorted list of unique tuples in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `audio` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (value from original audio, index + 1), `subs` is a list of integers converted from input; `res` is False, `anss` is 0, `audio2` is the sorted version of `audio`.**
