According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `subs` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `subs` must have at least one element. The variable `y` will start at 0 during the first iteration. 

Given the current state:
- `back` is assigned from the function call, which does not affect the loop execution.
- `res` is True, which does not influence the loop's ability to execute.
- `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which again does not influence the loop execution.
- `templis` being an empty list also does not affect the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments are necessary:
1. `subs` must have at least 1 element.
2. `y` should start at 0.

State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element and `y` is 0**
