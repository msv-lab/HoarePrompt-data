According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. The loop will execute as long as `z` is less than the length of `uniques`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0, and `uniques` has at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and the length of `uniques` must be at least 2.

State: **`back` is the result of func_1 with parameters (uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1); `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples of (subs[y], y + 1); `subs` is a list with at least 0 elements; `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements; `z` is 1**
