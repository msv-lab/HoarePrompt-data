The `templis` list is updated to include the tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)`. Given that `y` is 1, the value of `subs[y]` corresponds to `subs[1]`, and `y + 1` evaluates to `2`. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged, but the `templis` list will now include the new tuple based on the existing elements of `subs`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` now includes (subs[0], 1) and (subs[1], 2), `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.

Output State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` now includes (subs[0], 1) and (subs[1], 2), `subs` has at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, and `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
