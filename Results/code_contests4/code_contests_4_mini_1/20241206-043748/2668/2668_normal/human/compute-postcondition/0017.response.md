Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `init`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, then `counts` includes a new tuple: (counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1, init[i]). Otherwise, `counts` has a new element (1, init[0]) appended.***
