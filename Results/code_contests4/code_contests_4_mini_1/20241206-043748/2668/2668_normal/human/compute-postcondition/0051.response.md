Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, and `counts` is a list of at least 3 tuples. If `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, then `uniques` contains the instance of `counts[i]`, `i` remains 2, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.***
