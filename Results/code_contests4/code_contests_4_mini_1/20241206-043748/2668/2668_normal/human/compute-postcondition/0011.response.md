The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the initial state does not provide any information about being inside a loop, we cannot determine any changes to the variables based on the provided context. As such, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input.readline())`, `init` is sorted in reverse order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `init`, and we continue to the next iteration of a loop (if applicable).**
