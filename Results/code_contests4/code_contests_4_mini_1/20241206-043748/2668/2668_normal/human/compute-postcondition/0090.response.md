According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. If `z` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is currently the last index used in the loop, which implies it is equal to `len(uniques) - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1, making it equal to `len(uniques)`. This means that `len(uniques)` must be greater than the current value of `z` (which was `len(uniques) - 1`) for the loop to run again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `len(uniques)` must be greater than the current value of `z`, which is `len(uniques) - 1`, and `z` will be incremented to `len(uniques)`.

State: **`back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(uniques)` must be greater than the current value of `z`, and `z` is now `len(uniques)`**
