In the given code, `templis.append((subs[y], y + 1))` is executed. The variable `y` is currently 0, which means `subs[y]` refers to `subs[0]`. The expression `y + 1` evaluates to `1`. Therefore, a tuple containing `subs[0]` and `1` is appended to the list `templis`. 

The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` now contains a new element `(subs[0], 1)`, `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]**.
