`res` is assigned the value `True`. This directly changes the value of `res` from `False` to `True`. The values of the other variables (`uniques`, `i`, and `back`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, and `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`.

Output State: **`res` is True, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)**
