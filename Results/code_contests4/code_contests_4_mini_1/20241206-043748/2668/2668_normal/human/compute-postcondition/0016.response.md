In the provided code snippet, `counts.append((1, init[i]))` is executed. Here, `counts` is presumably a list that exists in the initial state. The operation appends a tuple consisting of the integer `1` and the element at index `i` of the list `init`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is assigned a value from input, but it does not affect the output directly.
- `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least one element.
- `i` is `0`, and `x` is the first element of `init`.
- The condition states that the element at index `i` of `init` is not equal to the element at index `i - 1` of `init`, which indicates that `i` must be `0`, allowing the reference to index `i - 1` to be valid.

Since `init` has at least one element and `i` is `0`, the first element of `init` is referenced. Therefore, we can conclude that a tuple `(1, init[0])` is appended to the list `counts`.

The output state reflects that a new tuple has been added to the `counts` list. 

Output State: **`counts` has a new element (1, init[0]) appended.**
