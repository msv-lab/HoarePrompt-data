Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, if `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, then `uniques` contains four instances of the first tuple from `counts` and two instances of the second tuple from `counts`, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second tuple in `counts`.***
