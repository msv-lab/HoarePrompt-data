The code snippet creates a new list `subs` using a list comprehension that iterates over the range of the original `subs` list. Each element of the new `subs` list is a tuple where the first element is taken from the original `subs` list at index `i`, and the second element is `i + 1`. The previous value of `subs` is not specified, but it is mentioned that it contains at least 0 elements. Therefore, the new `subs` list will contain tuples of the form `(original subs value, index + 1)` for each index in the original `subs`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is False, `anss` contains the result from the last successful call to `func_1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form `(subs[y], y + 1)`, and `subs` is transformed to contain tuples of the form `(original subs value, index + 1)` for each index in the original `subs`.**
