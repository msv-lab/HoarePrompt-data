According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. If `z` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1 and `uniques` has at least 2 elements, so for the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `z` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `uniques` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains all pairs (subs[y], y + 1) for which audio[y][0] is equal to uniques[i][1]; `subs` has at least 0 elements; `y` is less than len(subs); `z` is 2; `uniques` has at least 3 elements.**
