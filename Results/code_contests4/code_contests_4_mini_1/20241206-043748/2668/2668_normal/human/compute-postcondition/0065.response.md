The variable `templis` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables `back`, `res`, and `anss` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is a list with the first element being truthy; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is an empty list.

Output State: **`back` is a list with the first element being truthy; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is an empty list.**
