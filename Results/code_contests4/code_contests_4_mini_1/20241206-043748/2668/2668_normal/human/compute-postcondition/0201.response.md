The variable `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]`. The state of `anss` is unchanged or contains the result from the last successful call to `func_1`. Since `anss` is assumed to have at least two elements (as implied by accessing index 1), the value of `output` will be the second element of `anss`. The other variables (`res`, `uniques`, and `i`) remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is True; `anss` remains unchanged or contains the result from the last successful call to `func_1`; `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is equal to the length of `uniques`.

Output State: **`res` is True; `anss` remains unchanged or contains the result from the last successful call to `func_1`; `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element; `i` is equal to the length of `uniques`**
