The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of `func_1` for the last element of `uniques`, `res` is True if at least one call to `func_1` returned a truthy first element in `back`, otherwise it is not guaranteed to be True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last successful condition if it was met, otherwise it holds the value from the last iteration; `templis` remains a list containing tuples of (subs[y], y + 1); `subs` is a list with at least 0 elements; `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element; `z` is equal to `len(uniques) - 1` if the loop executed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
