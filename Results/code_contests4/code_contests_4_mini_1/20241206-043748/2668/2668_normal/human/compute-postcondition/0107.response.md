Postcondition: ***`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. If the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`, then `templis` contains a new element `(subs[0], 1)`, `subs` has at least 1 element, and `y` is 0.***
