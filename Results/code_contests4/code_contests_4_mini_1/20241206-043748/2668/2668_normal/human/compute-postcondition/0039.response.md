Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order, `counts` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `uniques` now contains two instances of the first tuple from `counts`, `i` is 0, `x` is the first tuple in `counts`, and `i + 1` is equal to the length of `counts` if `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`.***
