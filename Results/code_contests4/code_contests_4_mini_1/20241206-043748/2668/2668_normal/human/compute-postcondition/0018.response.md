According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `init` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `init`. Since `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. 

Now, for the loop to execute again, `init` must have at least 2 elements, so `x` will be the second element of `init`.

State: **`n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `init`.**
