The variable `init` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input.readline().split()))`, which processes a line of input read by `input.readline()`. This line is split into separate elements, each of which is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then collected into a list. The previous value of `n` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new state of `init` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input.readline())`; `init` is a list of integers based on the input line.**
