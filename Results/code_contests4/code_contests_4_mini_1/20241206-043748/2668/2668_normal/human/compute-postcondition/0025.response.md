The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, continuing with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer assigned from `int(input.readline())`, `init` is a sorted list in reverse order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `init`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
