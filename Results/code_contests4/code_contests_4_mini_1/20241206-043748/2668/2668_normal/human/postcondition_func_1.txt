The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` positive integers, a positive integer `m`, and two lists `b` and `c`, each containing `m` positive integers. It reads inputs from a file or standard input and processes the list `a` to determine unique elements and their counts. It checks whether certain conditions are met using a helper function `func_1`, and based on the results, it outputs either the index of a valid element or defaults to outputting `1`. If a file named 'output.txt' exists, the result is written to that file; otherwise, it is printed to standard output. The function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from file operations or input mismatches.
