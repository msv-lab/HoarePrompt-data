The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of positive integers `lis1`, and two positive integers `low` and `high`. It performs a binary search to determine if `num` is present in `lis1` and returns a tuple containing `True` and the corresponding value from `lis1` if found, or `False` and `-1` if not found. However, the implementation contains a potential type error due to using float division for the index calculation, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
