#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer representing the number of scientists, lis1 is a list of positive integers representing the languages known by each scientist, low is a positive integer representing the number of movies, and high is a list of pairs of positive integers representing the audio and subtitle languages of each movie, where the audio and subtitle languages are guaranteed to be different for each movie.

    return False, -1
    #The program returns False indicating that 'num' is not found in 'lis1', and -1 signifies the absence of a matching index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of positive integers `lis1`, and two positive integers `low` and `high`. It performs a binary search to determine if `num` is present in `lis1` and returns a tuple containing `True` and the corresponding value from `lis1` if found, or `False` and `-1` if not found. However, the implementation contains a potential type error due to using float division for the index calculation, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the languages known by the scientists, a positive integer `m`, and two lists of `m` positive integers representing the audio and subtitle languages of the movies. It returns the index of the first movie that can be understood by at least one scientist, based on the matching audio or subtitle languages. If no movie can be understood, it returns 1. The function considers both audio and subtitle languages but may have missing logic if no matches at all are found. Additionally, if the input files are not present, the function reads from standard input and writes to standard output instead of writing to a file.
