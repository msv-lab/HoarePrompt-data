Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is `init[1]`. If `i` equals 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `i` is not equal to 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the variables.***
