The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is `init[1]`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
