Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains at least three tuples, `i` is 2, `x` is the third tuple in `counts`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `counts`, then `uniques` now includes the third tuple from `counts`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
