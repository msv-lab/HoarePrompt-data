According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i` and the length of the `uniques` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `uniques`. Since `i` is currently 0, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `uniques` must have at least 2 elements (length greater than 1).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `res` is set to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `uniques` must have at least 2 elements.**
