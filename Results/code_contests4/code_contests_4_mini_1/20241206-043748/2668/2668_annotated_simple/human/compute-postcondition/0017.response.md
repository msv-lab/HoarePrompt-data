Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is `init[0]`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, `counts` is updated with a new tuple based on the last element of `counts` and `init[i]`. Otherwise, `counts` now includes the tuple (1, init[i]).***
