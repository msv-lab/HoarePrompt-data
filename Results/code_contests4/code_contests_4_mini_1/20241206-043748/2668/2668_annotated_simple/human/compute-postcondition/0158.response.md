The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is equal to `len(subs) - 1`, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `res` is True, `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1), templis` includes all tuples of the form `(subs[j], j + 1)` for each `j` where `audio[j][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, `z` is 0, `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1), back[0] is True, and `res` remains True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
