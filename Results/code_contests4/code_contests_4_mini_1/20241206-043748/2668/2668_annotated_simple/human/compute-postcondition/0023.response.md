Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is `init[1]`. If `init[i]` equals `init[i - 1]`, a new tuple has been appended to `counts` consisting of the incremented first element of the last tuple in `counts` and `init[1]`. Otherwise, a tuple (1, `init[1]`) has been appended to `counts`.***
