According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `uniques` list. The loop will execute for each index `z` in the range of `len(uniques)`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1, since it was initialized to 1 and increments with each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, `z` must be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `uniques` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is equal to the length of `subs`, `templis` is defined as specified, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, and `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. For the loop to execute a third time, `uniques` must have at least 3 elements.**
