Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is `init[2]`. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, a new tuple is appended to `counts` with the first element being the last count incremented by 1 and the second element being `init[i]`. Otherwise, a tuple `(1, init[2])` is appended to `counts`.***
