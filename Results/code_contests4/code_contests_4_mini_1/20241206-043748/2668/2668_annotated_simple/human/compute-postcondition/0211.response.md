Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the languages known by the scientists, a positive integer `m`, and two lists of `m` positive integers representing the audio and subtitle languages of the movies. It returns the index of the first movie that can be understood by at least one scientist, based on the matching audio or subtitle languages. If no movie can be understood, it returns 1. The function considers both audio and subtitle languages but may have missing logic if no matches at all are found. Additionally, if the input files are not present, the function reads from standard input and writes to standard output instead of writing to a file.**
