Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is `len(subs) - 1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`), and `len(uniques)` is greater than 0. If `back[0]` is True, `res` is True indicating that at least one `back[0]` was True during the loop executions, `anss` is assigned the value of the last `back` where `back[0]` was True, `i` is incremented by the number of iterations where `back[0]` was True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
