The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. The initial state indicates that `back` is a variable, and its first element is True. The specific value of `anss` will now reflect the value of `back`, which is not specified but is influenced by the execution of `func_1`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 0, and `back` is assigned the value obtained from `func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 0, and `back` is assigned the value obtained from `func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`**.
