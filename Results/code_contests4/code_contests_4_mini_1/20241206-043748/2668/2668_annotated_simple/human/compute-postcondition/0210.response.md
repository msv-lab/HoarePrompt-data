The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of scientists; `a`, which is a list of `n` positive integers indicating the languages known by the scientists; `m`, which is a positive integer representing the number of movies; `b`, which is a list of `m` positive integers indicating the audio languages of the movies; and `c`, which is a list of `m` positive integers indicating the subtitle languages of the movies. The function processes these inputs to determine how many movies can be understood by at least one scientist. 

The functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list of `n` positive integers `a`, a positive integer `m`, and two lists of `m` positive integers `b` and `c`, then return the count of movies that can be understood by at least one scientist based on the audio and subtitle languages they speak. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list of n positive integers a, a positive integer m, and two lists of m positive integers b and c, and returns the count of movies that can be understood by at least one scientist based on the audio and subtitle languages.**
