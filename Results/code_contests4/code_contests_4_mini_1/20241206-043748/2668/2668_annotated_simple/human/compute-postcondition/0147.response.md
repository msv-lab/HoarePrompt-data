The code appends a tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)` to the list `templis`. The value of `y` is 1, so `subs[y]` accesses the second element of the `subs` list. The value of `y + 1` is 2. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `subs` is a list with at least 2 elements, so `subs[1]` exists. The state of `templis` before this operation is not provided, but it will now include the new tuple after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `res` is True, `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, and `templis` now includes the tuple `(subs[1], 2)`**
