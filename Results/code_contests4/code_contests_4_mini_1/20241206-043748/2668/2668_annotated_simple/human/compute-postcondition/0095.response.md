Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is equal to the length of `subs`, `templis` is defined as specified, and `len(uniques)` is greater than 0. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
