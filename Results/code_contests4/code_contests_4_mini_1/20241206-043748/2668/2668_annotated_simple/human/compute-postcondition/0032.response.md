According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `counts` variable. Since `counts` contains tuples representing the count of occurrences of each unique integer in `init`, the loop will execute if `counts` contains at least one tuple. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it is implied that there are unique integers in `init`, which should result in at least one tuple in `counts`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `uniques` remains an empty list, and `i` and `x` will be adjusted during the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `counts` must have at least one tuple, and the index `i` will start at 0 with `x` being the first tuple from `counts`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains at least one tuple, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `x` is the first tuple in `counts`**
