The value of `subs[y]` is accessed, where `y` is 2. Since `subs` has at least `n` elements, and `n` is a positive integer, `subs[y]` is valid. The value at index 2 of `subs` is appended to `templis` along with the value `y + 1`, which is 3. The other variables (`n`, `subs`, and `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is 2, and the new entry (value of `subs[2]`, 3) is appended to `templis`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is 2, and the new entry (value of `subs[2]`, 3) is appended to `templis`.**
