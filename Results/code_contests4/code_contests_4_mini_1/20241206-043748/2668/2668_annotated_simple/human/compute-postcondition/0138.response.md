Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements; `y` is `len(subs) - 1`; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `len(uniques)` is greater than 0; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of the last `back` where `back[0]` was True; `i` is incremented by the number of iterations where `back[0]` was True; and `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`.**
