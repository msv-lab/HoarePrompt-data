The code appends a tuple to the list `templis`, where the first element of the tuple is `subs[y]` and the second element is `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 2, `subs[y]` refers to the third element of `subs`, and `y + 1` equals 3. The values of `n` and `subs` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, and a tuple `(subs[2], 3)` has been appended to `templis`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, and a tuple `(subs[2], 3)` has been appended to `templis`.**
