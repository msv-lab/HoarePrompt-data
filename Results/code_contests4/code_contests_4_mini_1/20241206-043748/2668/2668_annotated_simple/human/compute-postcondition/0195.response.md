`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`. The previous value of `anss` is not specified, but it now holds the value of `back`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 2, `back` is assigned the return value of func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 2, `back` is assigned the return value of func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)**
