Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `b` is a list of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ bj ≤ 1,000,000,000), and `c` is a list of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ cj ≤ 1,000,000,000). If the file 'input.txt' exists, it is opened for reading. Otherwise, if 'input.txt' does not exist, the input is set to sys.stdin.***
