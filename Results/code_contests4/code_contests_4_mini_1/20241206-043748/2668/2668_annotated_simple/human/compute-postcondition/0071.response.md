The variable `templis` is appended with the tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)`. Given that `y` is 1, the value `subs[y]` corresponds to `subs[1]`, and `y + 1` equals `2`. Therefore, the tuple being appended is `(subs[1], 2)`. The previous values of `subs` are not affected, and we assume `templis` already exists as a list. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, and `templis` now contains the tuple (`subs[1]`, 2)**
