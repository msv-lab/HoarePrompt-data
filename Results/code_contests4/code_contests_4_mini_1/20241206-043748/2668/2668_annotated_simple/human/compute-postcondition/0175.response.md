Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the iterations, otherwise `res` remains False; `anss` is the value of `back` from the first successful iteration or retains its last assigned value if no successful iteration occurred; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`) for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` equals the last processed `uniques[i][1]`; `len(uniques)` is greater than 0.**
