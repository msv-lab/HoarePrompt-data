According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `uniques`. If `i` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Additionally, the length of `uniques` must be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `res` remains True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time the length of `uniques` must be greater than 2**
