Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains at least one tuple, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first tuple in `counts`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `counts`, then `uniques` now contains the first tuple from `counts` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
