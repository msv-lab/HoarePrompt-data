The `init` list is sorted in descending order (reverse=True). The value of `n` is not affected by this operation, and its initial value remains unchanged. The output state reflects the new state of the `init` list after sorting. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value from the first line of input, which is a positive integer; `init` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value from the first line of input, which is a positive integer; `init` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.**
