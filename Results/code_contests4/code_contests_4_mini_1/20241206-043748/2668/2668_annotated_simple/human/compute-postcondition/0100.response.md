Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is equal to the length of `subs`, `templis` is defined as specified, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is equal to `len(uniques)`, `res` is either True if any `back[0]` was True during the iterations or remains False if none were found, `anss` is either the last value of `back` where `back[0]` was True or remains undefined if none were found; `i` is incremented by 1 and `len(uniques)` must be greater than `i + 1`, `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`.**
