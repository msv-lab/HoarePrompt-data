Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements; `y` is `len(subs) - 1`; `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`); `len(uniques)` is greater than 0; `z` is equal to `i + 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1); res` is True.**
