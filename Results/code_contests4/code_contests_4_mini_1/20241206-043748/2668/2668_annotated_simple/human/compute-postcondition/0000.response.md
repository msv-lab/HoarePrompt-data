Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000) representing the languages known by the scientists, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `b` is a list of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ bj ≤ 1,000,000,000) representing the audio languages of the movies, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ cj ≤ 1,000,000,000) representing the subtitles languages of the movies, with the condition that bj ≠ cj for each movie j, and the file 'input.txt' exists.***
