The operation `templis.append((subs[y], y + 1))` appends a tuple containing the value of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` to the list `templis`. 

- `subs[y]` retrieves the `y`-th element from the list `subs`, which has at least `n` elements, ensuring that the index `y` is valid.
- The value of `y` is currently 0, so `y + 1` will evaluate to 1.

Since `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements and `y` is 0, the output state will reflect the addition of the first element of `subs` and the value `1` to `templis`.

Output State: **`templis` now includes the tuple (subs[0], 1)**
