The code appends a tuple to the list `templis`. The first element of the tuple is `subs[y]`, and since `y` is 2, this corresponds to the third element of the list `subs`. The second element of the tuple is `y + 1`, which equals 3. The list `templis` will now have an additional entry.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `res` is True, `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, and `templis` has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `res` is True, `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, and `templis` has been updated to include the tuple `(subs[2], 3)`**.
