Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the iterations, and `anss` is assigned the value of the last `back` where `back[0]` was True. `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1) for each `y`, and `i` is equal to the length of `uniques` if the loop executes fully. If the loop does not execute, then `res` remains False, `anss` retains its last assigned value, and `i` is 0.***
