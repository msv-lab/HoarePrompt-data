According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. The loop will execute again if `z` is less than `len(uniques) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, and if `back[0]` is true, then `res` is set to `True`, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Assuming that the last value of `z` was such that the loop was able to run, we can infer that `z` is currently equal to the index of the last processed element of `uniques` (which is `len(uniques) - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, for the loop to execute one more time `uniques` must have at least `len(uniques) + 1` elements, and `z` is `len(uniques)`**
