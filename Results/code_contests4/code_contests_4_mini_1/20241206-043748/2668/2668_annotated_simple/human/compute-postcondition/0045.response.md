Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains at least two tuples, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second tuple in `counts`. If the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is not equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1`, then `uniques` now contains the second tuple from `counts`.***
