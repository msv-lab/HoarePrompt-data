The variable `templis` is assigned an empty list `[]`. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new state of `templis` while maintaining the values of all other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements; `y` is `len(subs) - 1`; `templis` is []; `len(uniques)` is greater than 0; `res` is True; `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1); `i` is incremented by the number of iterations where `back[0]` was True; `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)**
