The variable `uniques` is initialized as an empty list. Since it is being assigned a new value and there are no other changes to the existing variables, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains tuples where each tuple represents the count of occurrences of each unique integer in `init`, and `uniques` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains tuples where each tuple represents the count of occurrences of each unique integer in `init`, and `uniques` is an empty list.**
