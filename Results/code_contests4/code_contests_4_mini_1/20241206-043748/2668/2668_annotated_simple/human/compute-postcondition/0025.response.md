The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop is defined in the given context, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

The values of the variables are:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is `init[2]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is `init[2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop (if any).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is `init[2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop (if any).**
