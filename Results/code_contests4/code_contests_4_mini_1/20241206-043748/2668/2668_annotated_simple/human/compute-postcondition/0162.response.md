The variable `res` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `back` is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is `True`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is `True`**.
