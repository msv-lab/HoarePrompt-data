The code appends a tuple to the `templis` list. The tuple consists of the element at index `y` of the `subs` list and the value of `y + 1`. Since `y` is 0, this means the first element of `subs` is being appended along with the value 1. The previous values of the affected variables are: `subs` is a list with at least 1 element, and `y` is 0. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `templis`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 1 element, `y` is 0, the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i`, and `templis` now contains the tuple (`subs[0]`, 1)**
