Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 2 elements, `y` is 1, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `res` is True, and `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`. If `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`, then `templis` now includes the tuple `(subs[1], 2)`.***
