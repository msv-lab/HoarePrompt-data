Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is 0 (the first value of the loop), `templis` is an empty list, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is equal to `len(uniques)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, where `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `len(uniques)` is greater than `i + 1`, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`***
