The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 2, `back` is assigned the return value of func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
