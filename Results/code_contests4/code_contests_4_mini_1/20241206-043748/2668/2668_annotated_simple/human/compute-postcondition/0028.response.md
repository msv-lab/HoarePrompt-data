The code `counts.append((1, init[i]))` appends a tuple `(1, init[i])` to the list `counts`. Since `i` is 2, `init[i]` corresponds to the third element of the sorted list `init`. The value of `init[2]` is assigned to `x`, but it is used in the append operation directly from `init`. The other variables (`n`, `init`, and `x`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `x` is `init[2]`; and a tuple `(1, init[2])` has been appended to `counts`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `x` is `init[2]`; and a tuple `(1, init[2])` has been appended to `counts`.**
