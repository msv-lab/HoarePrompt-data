Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is `len(subs) - 1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`), `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is `len(uniques)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is incremented by 1, `z` is equal to `i`, and `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`.**
