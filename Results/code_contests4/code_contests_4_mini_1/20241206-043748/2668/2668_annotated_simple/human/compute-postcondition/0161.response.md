The code assigns the result of the function `func_1` to the variable `back`. The input to this function is `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. The previous state of the variables indicates that `z` is 1, which means `uniques[z][1]` is the second element of the `uniques` list. The state of `templis` is a list of tuples corresponding to the elements of `subs` that match with `uniques[i][1]`. The value of `back` will depend on the outcome of `func_1`, which is not specified but will be assigned to `back`.

Since `back` is assigned the result of the function call, the output state is affected by this assignment. However, without knowing the specific implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `back`. Therefore, we can only describe the impact in general terms.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`**
