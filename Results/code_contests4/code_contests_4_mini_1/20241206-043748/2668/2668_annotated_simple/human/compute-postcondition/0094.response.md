The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is equal to the length of `subs`, `templis` is defined as specified, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
