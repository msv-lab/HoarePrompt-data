Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains at least three tuples, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third tuple in `counts`. If `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, then `uniques` now includes the third tuple from `counts`.***
