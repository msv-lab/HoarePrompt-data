The code appends a tuple to the `counts` list. The first element of the tuple is the result of `counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1`, which means we take the first element of the last tuple in `counts` and add 1 to it. The second element of the tuple is `init[i]`, which is defined in the initial state. 

The affected variables are:
- `counts`, which will have a new tuple added to it.
- The last element of `counts` is affected as we use its first element.

Since `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, the value of `init[i]` will be the same as the previous value in the sorted list.

The output state will reflect the updated `counts` list with the new appended tuple.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is `init[0]`, and `counts` is updated with a new tuple based on the last element of `counts` and `init[i]`.**
