The code appends a tuple `(1, init[i])` to the list `counts`. Here, `init[i]` is the integer at the current index `i` of the sorted list `init`. Since `counts` is being modified, its state will change by adding the new tuple. The values of `n`, `init`, and `i` remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is `init[0]`, and `counts` now includes the tuple (1, init[i])**.
