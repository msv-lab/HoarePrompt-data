Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is `len(subs) - 1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`), `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is equal to `i + 1`, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. If `back[0]` is True, then `anss` retains the value of `back` and `res` remains True, allowing for a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
