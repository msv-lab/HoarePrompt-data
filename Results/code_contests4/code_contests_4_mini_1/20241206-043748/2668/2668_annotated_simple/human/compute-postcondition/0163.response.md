The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the result of the function `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The value of `back` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unknown. The other variable `res` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is `True`; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `res` is `True`; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`**.
