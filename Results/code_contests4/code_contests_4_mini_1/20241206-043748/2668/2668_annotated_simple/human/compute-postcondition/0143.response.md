Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements; `y` is now 0 (the first iteration); `len(uniques)` is greater than 0; `res` is True; `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1); `i` is incremented by the number of iterations where `back[0]` was True; `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1); the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`***
