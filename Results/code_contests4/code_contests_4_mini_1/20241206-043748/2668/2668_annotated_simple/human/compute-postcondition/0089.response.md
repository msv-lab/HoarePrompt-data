Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is equal to the length of `subs`, `templis` is defined as specified, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, and `back` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. If `back[0]` is true, then `res` is set to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
