`init` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the integers from a line of input split by whitespace. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, but does not provide its specific value. Therefore, the output state reflects that `init` is now a list of integers derived from the input, while `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value from the first line of input, which is a positive integer; `init` is a list of integers from the input.**
