The variable `res` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `res` was `False`, so now it is changed to `True`. Other variables (`n`, `anss`, `templis`, `i`, and `back`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` retains its last assigned value, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 0, `back` is assigned the value of func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1), and the first element of `back` is True.
