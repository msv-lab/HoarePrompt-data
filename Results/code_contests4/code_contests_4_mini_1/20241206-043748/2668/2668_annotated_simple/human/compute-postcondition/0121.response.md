Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is `len(subs) - 1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`) for each index where the condition was met, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is equal to `len(uniques)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is incremented by 1, `len(uniques)` is greater than `i + 1`, and `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[0][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is assigned the value True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
