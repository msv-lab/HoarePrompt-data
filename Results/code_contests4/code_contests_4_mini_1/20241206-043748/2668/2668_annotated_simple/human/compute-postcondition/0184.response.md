The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 0, and `back` is assigned the value obtained from `func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1); and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
