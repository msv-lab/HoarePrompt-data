Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If the file 'output.txt' exists, then `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]`, and the contents of 'output.txt' contain the string representation of `output`. If the file does not exist, `output` is assigned the value 1, and this value is written to 'stdout'. In both cases, `anss` retains its last assigned value, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1) for each `y`, and `i` is either equal to the length of `uniques` or 0, depending on the existence of the file.***
