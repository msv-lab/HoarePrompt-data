Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `res` is True, then `anss` contains the last `back` where `back[0]` was True, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1) for each `y`, `i` is equal to the length of `uniques`, `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]`, and the file 'output.txt' exists. Otherwise, if `res` is False, `anss` retains its last assigned value, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1) for each `y`, `i` is 0, `output` is assigned the value 1, and the file 'output.txt' exists.***
