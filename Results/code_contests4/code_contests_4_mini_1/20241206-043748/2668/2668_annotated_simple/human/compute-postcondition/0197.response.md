Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 2, and `back` is the return value of func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1). If `back[0]` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
