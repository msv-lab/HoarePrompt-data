Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `res` is True, and `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`. If `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, then `templis` is updated to include the tuple `(subs[2], 3)`.***
