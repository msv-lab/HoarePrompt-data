The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `x` is the first tuple in `counts`, `uniques` now contains the first tuple from `counts` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
