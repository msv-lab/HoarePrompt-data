According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `init`. The loop will iterate over the elements of `init`, and the variable `i` will represent the current index while `x` will represent the current element from the list. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `init` must contain at least one element since it is sorted in descending order. The variable `n` does not directly affect the execution of the loop but may indicate the size of `init`. 

At the start of the loop, since `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the first element (`x`) will be `init[0]`, and the initial index (`i`) will be 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `init` must contain at least one integer, and the state of the variables will be: 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is init[0]**
