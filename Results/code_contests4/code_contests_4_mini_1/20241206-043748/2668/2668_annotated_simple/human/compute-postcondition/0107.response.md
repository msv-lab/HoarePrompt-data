Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is 0, `templis` contains the tuple (`subs[0]`, 1), `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is equal to `len(uniques)`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `len(uniques)` is greater than `i + 1`. Additionally, if the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`, then all these conditions hold true.***
