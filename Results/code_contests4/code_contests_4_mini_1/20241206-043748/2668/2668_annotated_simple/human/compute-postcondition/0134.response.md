Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is `len(subs) - 1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`), `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is equal to `i` (which is less than or equal to `len(uniques)`), `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the loop executions, `anss` is assigned the value of the last `back` where `back[0]` was True, `i` is incremented by the number of iterations where `back[0]` was True, and if no `back[0]` was True, `res` remains True and `anss` retains its last value.**
