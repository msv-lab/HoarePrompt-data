According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `uniques` list. If the list has more elements than the current value of `z`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is equal to `i`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `z` must be equal to `i` and it should be less than the length of `uniques`. Since `z` is equal to `i`, we expect `z` to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements, `y` is `len(subs) - 1`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (`subs[y]`, `y + 1`), `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `z` is equal to `i + 1`, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `back[0]` is true.**
