The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. The previous value of `back` is the result returned by the function `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`. Since `anss` takes on the value of `back`, it affects only the `anss` variable, and no other variables are changed. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `back` to `anss`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 1, and `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)**
