Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the iterations, `anss` is assigned the value of the last `back` where `back[0]` was True, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is equal to the length of `uniques` if the loop executes fully, and `back` is the last value obtained from `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)` during the last iteration. If the loop does not execute, `res` remains False, `anss` retains its last assigned value, and `i` is 0.**
