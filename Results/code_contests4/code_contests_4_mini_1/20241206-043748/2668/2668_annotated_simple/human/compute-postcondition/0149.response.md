According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the length of the `subs` list. If `y` is less than the length of `subs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and the length of `subs` is at least 2, which means the loop can run again. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the length of `subs` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `subs` is a list with at least 3 elements, `y` is 2, `len(uniques)` is greater than 0, `res` is True, and `anss` is the result of `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`.**
