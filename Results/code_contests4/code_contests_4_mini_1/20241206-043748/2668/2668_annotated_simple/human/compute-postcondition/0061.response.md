Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `counts` contains tuples representing the counts of occurrences of unique integers in `init`, `uniques` is now sorted in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `audio` is now a list of tuples where each tuple is (original_value, index + 1), `subs` is a list of integers from input, `res` is False, `anss` is 0, `audio2` is the sorted list of `audio`, `i` is 0, and a value is returned from `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1)`.**
