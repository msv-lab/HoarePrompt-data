Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `res` is set to True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples of the form (subs[y], y + 1), `i` is 0, and `back` is assigned the value obtained from `func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1) if back[0] is true. If `back[0]` is false, the state remains unchanged.***
