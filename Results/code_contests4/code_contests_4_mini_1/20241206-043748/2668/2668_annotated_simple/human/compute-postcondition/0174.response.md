Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `subs` is a list with at least `n` elements; `y` is equal to `len(subs) - 1`; `len(uniques)` is greater than 0; `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the iterations, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `anss` is the value of `back` from the first successful iteration or retains its last assigned value if no successful iteration occurred; `templis` includes all tuples of the form `(subs[j], j + 1)` for each `j` where `audio[j][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
