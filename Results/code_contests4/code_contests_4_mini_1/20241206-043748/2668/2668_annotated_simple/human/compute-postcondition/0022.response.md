The code appends a tuple `(1, init[i])` to the list `counts`. The variable `i` is 1, so `init[i]` corresponds to `init[1]`, which is the second element of the sorted list `init`. The initial values of `n`, `init`, and `x` are not directly affected by this operation, but `counts` will now contain a new tuple based on the current state of `init`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is `init[1]`, and a tuple (1, init[1]) has been appended to `counts`.**
