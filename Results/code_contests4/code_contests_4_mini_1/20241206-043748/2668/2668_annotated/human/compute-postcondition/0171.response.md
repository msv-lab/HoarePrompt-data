Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of the call to `func_1` with the arguments `uniques[2][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided; `z` is 2; and for the loop to execute a third time, `len(uniques)` must be greater than 2. If `back[0]` is True, then `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no action taken, and the execution continues without breaking.***
