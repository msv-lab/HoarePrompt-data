The code appends a new tuple to the list `templis`. The new tuple consists of the value of `subs[y]` and `y + 1`. Given that `y` is 2, the value of `subs[y]` refers to `subs[2]`. Therefore, the tuple that gets appended is `(subs[2], 3)`. 

The previous state of `templis` is `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)]`, and after the execution of the code, `templis` will now include the new tuple. 

The states of the other variables (`back`, `res`, `anss`, `y`, and `subs`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is now `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2), (subs[2], 3)]`, `y` is 2, and `subs` contains at least 3 elements if `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
