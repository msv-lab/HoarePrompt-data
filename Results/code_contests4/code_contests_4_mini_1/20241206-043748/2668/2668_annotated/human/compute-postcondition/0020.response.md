Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `init`. If `i` is 0, the state of the program remains unchanged since there is no else part defined.***
