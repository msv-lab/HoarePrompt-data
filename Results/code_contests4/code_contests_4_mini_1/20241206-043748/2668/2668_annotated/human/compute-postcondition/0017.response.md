Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, and `i` remains 0. If the element at index `i` of `init` is equal to the element at index `i - 1`, then `counts` now includes the tuple (2, init[0]). Otherwise, `counts` contains one more tuple (1, init[0]) and `i` remains 0.***
