The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop in which it resides. Therefore, the states of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `init`.**
