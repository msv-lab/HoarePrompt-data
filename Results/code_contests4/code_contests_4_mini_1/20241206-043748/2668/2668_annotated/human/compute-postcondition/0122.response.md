According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the length of the `uniques` list. If `uniques` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0, and `uniques` has at least 1 element, allowing the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` will be incremented by 1, making `z` equal to 1, and `uniques` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to run again.

State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(...)`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, `uniques` is a list with at least 2 elements, `z` is 1**
