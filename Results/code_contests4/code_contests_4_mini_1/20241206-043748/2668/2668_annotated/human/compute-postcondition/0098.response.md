Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least one element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least one element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is a list of integers with at least one element. If `back[0]` is True, then `res` is set to True, `anss` contains the value of `back` from the last successful invocation of `func_1` where `back[0]` was True, and `z` equals the length of `uniques` if the loop executes to completion. If `back[0]` was True in an earlier iteration and the loop was exited early, `z` is less than the length of `uniques`. Otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
