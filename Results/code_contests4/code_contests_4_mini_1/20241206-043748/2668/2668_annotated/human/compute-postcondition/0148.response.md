Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of the last successful `func_1` call, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `y` is 1, and `subs` has at least 2 elements. If `audio[1][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, then `templis` is updated to include the tuple (subs[0], 1) and an additional tuple (subs[1], 2). If `audio[1][0]` does not equal `uniques[i][1]`, `templis` remains unchanged.***
