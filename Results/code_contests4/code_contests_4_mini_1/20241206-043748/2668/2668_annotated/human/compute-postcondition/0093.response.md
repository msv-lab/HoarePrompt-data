The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. The value of `back` was previously assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, but the exact value of `back` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `anss` now holds the value of `back`. Other variables remain unchanged, with `z` having been incremented and `res` being True.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`; `z` is incremented to `z + 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
