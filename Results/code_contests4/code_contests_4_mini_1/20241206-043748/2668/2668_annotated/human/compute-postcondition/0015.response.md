Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing the tuple (1, init[0]), `i` remains 0, and the element at position `i` in `init` is not equal to the element at position `i - 1` in `init`. The loop continues.***
