Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is now sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is True, `anss` is True, the first element of `back` is True, `templis` contains the tuple (subs[0], 1), `y` is 0, if the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i`, then `templis` is updated to contain the tuple (subs[0], 1).***
