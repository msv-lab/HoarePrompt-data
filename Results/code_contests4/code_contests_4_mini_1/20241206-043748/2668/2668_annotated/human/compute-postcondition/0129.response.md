Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, where `z` is `current_z + 1`; `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `uniques` must have at least `current_z + 2` elements.**
