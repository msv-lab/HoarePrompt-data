The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the current context we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of the call to `func_1` with the arguments `uniques[0][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided; `z` is 0; the first element of `back` is True; and `res` remains True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
