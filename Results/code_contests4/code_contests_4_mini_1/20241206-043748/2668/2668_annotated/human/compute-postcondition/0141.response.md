The code initializes `templis` as an empty list. This does not affect any other variables that were previously defined. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new definition of `templis`.

Output State: **`back` is the result of the last successful `func_1` call; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is an empty list; `uniques` is a list with at least one element; `i` is incremented to `i + 1; `back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[i][1], audio2, 0, len(audio2) - 1); `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
