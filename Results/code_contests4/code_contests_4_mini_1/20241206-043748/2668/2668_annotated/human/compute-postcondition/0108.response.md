According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the length of `subs`. The loop will execute as long as `y` is less than `len(subs)`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, and `subs` must contain at least 2 elements for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, after the first iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1, so `y` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `subs` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is now `[(subs[0], 1)]`, `y` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `subs` must contain at least 2 elements.**
