Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is True, `anss` is True, the first element of `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `templis` contains tuples of (subs[y], y + 1) for each `y` where `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, or is empty if no matches are found, `y` equals the length of `subs`, and `z` is 0.**
