The value of `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Since `back` has already been assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`, the value of `anss` now reflects whatever `back` holds. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers; `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least one element; `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`; `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `audio` is a list of integers; `subs` is now sorted; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for matches found; `i` is 2; `back` is assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[i][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1); `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
