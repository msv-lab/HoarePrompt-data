The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `n`: a positive integer representing the number of scientists (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).
2. `a`: a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `ai` represents the language index known by the i-th scientist (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).
3. `m`: a positive integer representing the number of movies (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000).
4. `b`: a list of `m` positive integers where each integer `bj` represents the audio language index of the j-th movie (1 ≤ bj ≤ 10^9).
5. `c`: a list of `m` positive integers where each integer `cj` represents the subtitles language index of the j-th movie (1 ≤ cj ≤ 10^9), with the condition that bj ≠ cj for each movie.

The function does not directly specify its output, but based on the context of the parameters, it likely processes these inputs to determine which scientists can understand the audio or subtitles of the movies.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, m, b, and c, and processes the relationship between scientists' language knowledge and the languages used in movies.**
