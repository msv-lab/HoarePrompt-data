According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. If `z` is less than `len(uniques) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` has been assigned a value from the function call, and we need to determine the next value of `z`. Since the loop is defined with `range(len(uniques))`, `z` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

Therefore, if `z` is currently at a value that allows the loop to execute, it will increment to `z + 1` for the next iteration. To execute one more time, `z` must be less than `len(uniques)`. 

State: **`back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, for the loop to execute a second time `z` is incremented to `z + 1`, and `uniques` must have at least `z + 2` elements.**
