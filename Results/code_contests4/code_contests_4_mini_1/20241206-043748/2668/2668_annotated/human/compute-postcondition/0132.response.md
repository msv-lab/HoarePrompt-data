The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the value of `back`; `back[0]` is True; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
