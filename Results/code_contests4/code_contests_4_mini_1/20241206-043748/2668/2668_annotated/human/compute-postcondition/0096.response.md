Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` was True during the loop execution, `anss` contains the value of `back` from the last successful invocation of `func_1` where `back[0]` was True or remains True if no successful invocation occurs, `back` is the last value returned by `func_1` for the last iteration of the loop, `z` is equal to the length of `uniques` if the loop executes to completion, or less if `back[0]` was True in an earlier iteration and the loop was exited early.**
