The code appends a tuple `(1, init[i])` to the list `counts`. The value of `i` is 1, and `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, meaning `init[1]` is a valid index. Therefore, `init[i]` evaluates to the second element of `init`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `init`, and a tuple `(1, init[1])` is appended to `counts`.**
