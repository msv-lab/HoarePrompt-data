Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in `init`. If `i` equals 0, the current iteration of the most internal loop is skipped. Otherwise, there are no changes to the program state.***
