The code initializes an empty list `templis`. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables, such as `back`, `res`, or `anss`. Consequently, the output state remains unchanged for these variables.

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and `templis` is an empty list.**
