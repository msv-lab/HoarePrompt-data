The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Since `back` is already assigned the result of `func_1(uniques[1][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, the value of `anss` will be the same as `back`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`**.
