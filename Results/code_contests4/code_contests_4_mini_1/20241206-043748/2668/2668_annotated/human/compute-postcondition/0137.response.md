According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `uniques` list. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(uniques)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, and `uniques` has at least one element, which means `len(uniques)` is at least 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be less than `len(uniques)`. If `i` was the last valid index in the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be updated to the next index.

State: **`back` is the result of the last successful `func_1` call, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, and `uniques` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the next index in the range of `uniques`, which is `i + 1`.**
