The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of the last successful `func_1` call, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, `uniques` is a list with at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
