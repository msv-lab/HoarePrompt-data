The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. The value of `back` is derived from the call to `func_1` with the arguments `uniques[2][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. Since `back` is already defined and holds a specific value based on that function call, the assignment doesn't change any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the assignment of `anss`.

Output State: **`anss` is assigned the value of `back`**
