Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `init`. If `init[i]` equals `init[i - 1]`, a new tuple has been appended to `counts` with values (`counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1`, `init[2]`). Otherwise, a tuple (1, `init[2]`) has been appended to `counts`.***
