According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. If `z` is less than `len(uniques)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `len(uniques)` must be greater than 1. After this iteration, `z` will be incremented by 1, so `z` will be 2 when the loop is evaluated again.

State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1` with the arguments `uniques[1][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided; `z` is 2; for the loop to execute a third time, `len(uniques)` must be greater than 2.**
