Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of the last successful call to `func_1`, `res` is True indicating that at least one call to `func_1` returned a result where the first element is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, and `z` is the index of the last executed iteration, which reflects the state of iteration through `uniques`.***
