The code `counts.append((1, init[i]))` appends a tuple `(1, init[i])` to the list `counts`. The variable `i` is currently 0, and `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element. Therefore, `init[i]` refers to the first element of `init`. Since `counts` initially contains the tuple `(1, init[0])`, after execution, `counts` will now have one additional tuple appended to it.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` now contains one more tuple `(1, init[0])`, and `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` now contains one more tuple `(1, init[0])`, and `i` remains 0.**
