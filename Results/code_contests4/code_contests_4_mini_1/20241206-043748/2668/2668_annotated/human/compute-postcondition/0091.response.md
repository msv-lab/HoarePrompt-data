The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. The value returned by this function is assigned to `back`. The variable `z` is incremented by `1`, allowing the loop to execute a second time. Additionally, the condition states that `uniques` must have at least `z + 2` elements for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `back` from the function call, the incremented value of `z`, and the requirement for `uniques`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`, `z` is incremented to `z + 1`, and `uniques` has at least `z + 2` elements.**
