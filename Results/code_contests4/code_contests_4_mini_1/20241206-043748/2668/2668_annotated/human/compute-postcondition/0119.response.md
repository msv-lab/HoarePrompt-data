In this code snippet, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Since `back` has already been assigned a value from the result of `func_1(...)`, `anss` will now reference the same value as `back`. The previous values of the affected variables are `back` and `anss`. The other variables (`templis`, `uniques`, `z`, and `res`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(...)`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is 0, and `back[0]` is True.

Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of `func_1(...)`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is 0, and `back[0]` is True.**
