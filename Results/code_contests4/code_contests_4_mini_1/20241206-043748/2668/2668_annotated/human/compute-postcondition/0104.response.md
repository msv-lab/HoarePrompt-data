According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `subs`. The loop will execute if `subs` has at least one element, which means that its length must be greater than 0. 

Before the loop starts, `back` is assigned a value from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and `templis` is an empty list. None of these conditions directly influence the execution of the loop except for the length of `subs`.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the state of `subs` must be such that it contains at least one element, and the variable `y` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start iterating from the first index.

State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element, and `y` is 0**
