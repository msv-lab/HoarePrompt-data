The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of the last successful call to `func_1`, `res` is True if at least one call to `func_1` returned a result with its first element as True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided, and `z` is the index of the last executed iteration, which is one less than the length of `uniques` if the loop executed completely, or less if it broke early.
