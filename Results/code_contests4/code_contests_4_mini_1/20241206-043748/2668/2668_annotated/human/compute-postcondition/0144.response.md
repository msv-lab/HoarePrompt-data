The code appends a tuple to the `templis` list. The first element of the tuple is `subs[y]` and the second element is `y + 1`. Since `y` is 0, `y + 1` becomes 1. The value of `subs` is not specified, but it has at least one element. Therefore, `subs[0]` is used for the first element of the tuple. The values of `back`, `res`, `anss`, `uniques`, and the elements of `audio` are not affected by this operation. 

The Output State is: `templis` now contains one tuple with the first element being `subs[0]` and the second element being `1`, `y` is still 0.

Output State: **`templis` is a list containing one tuple: (subs[0], 1), `y` is 0**
