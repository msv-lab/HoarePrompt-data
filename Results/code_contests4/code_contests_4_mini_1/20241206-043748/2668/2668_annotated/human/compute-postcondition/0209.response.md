Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers; `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least one element; `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`; `uniques` is sorted in descending order; `audio` is a list of integers; `subs` is now sorted. If the file 'output.txt' exists, then `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the last successful result from `func_1` if a match is found, otherwise it retains its initial state, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for matches found, and `output` is 1. If the file does not exist, the variable `output` is converted to a string and written to standard output while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.***
