Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least one element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is now sorted, `res` is False, `anss` contains the last successful result from `func_1`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for matches found, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time; `back` is the result of `func_1(uniques[0][1], subs, 0, len(subs) - 1)`, and the first element of `back` is True.***
