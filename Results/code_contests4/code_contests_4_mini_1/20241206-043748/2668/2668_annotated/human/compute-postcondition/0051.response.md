Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains at least 2 tuples, `uniques` now contains the first and second tuples from `counts`. If `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, `uniques` is updated to include `counts[i]`.***
