The `templis` list is being updated by appending a new tuple. The tuple consists of `subs[y]` and `y + 1`. The current value of `y` is 1, so `y + 1` will be 2. The code tries to access `subs[1]` (the second element of `subs`) for the first part of the tuple. Since the task specifies that `subs` must contain at least 2 elements for the loop to execute a second time, we can assume `subs[1]` is valid.

After executing the code, `templis` will now include the new tuple `(subs[1], 2)`, while the state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is now `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)]`, `y` is 1; `subs` contains at least 2 elements.**
