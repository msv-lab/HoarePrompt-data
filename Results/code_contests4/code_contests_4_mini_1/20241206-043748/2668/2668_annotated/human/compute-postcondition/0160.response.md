According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the length of `uniques`. If `z` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be incremented by 1, so `z` will be 1. The loop will execute again as long as the length of `uniques` is greater than 1. 

State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1` with the arguments `uniques[0][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided; `z` is 1; for the loop to execute again, the length of `uniques` must be greater than 1.**
