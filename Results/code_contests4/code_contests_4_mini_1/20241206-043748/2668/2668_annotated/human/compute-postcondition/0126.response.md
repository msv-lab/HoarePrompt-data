The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
