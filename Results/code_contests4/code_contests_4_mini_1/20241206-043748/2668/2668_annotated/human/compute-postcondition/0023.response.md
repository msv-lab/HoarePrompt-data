Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `init`. If `init[i]` equals `init[i - 1]`, then `counts` is modified to include a tuple of (previous count + 1, `init[1]`). Otherwise, a tuple `(1, init[1])` is appended to `counts`.***
