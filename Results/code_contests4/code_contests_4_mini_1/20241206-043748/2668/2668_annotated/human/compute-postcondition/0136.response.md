Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of the last successful `func_1` call, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, and `uniques` is a list with at least one element. If `back[0]` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
