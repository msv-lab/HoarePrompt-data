Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least one element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is now sorted, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for matches found, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time; if the first element of `back` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating a successful match was found.***
