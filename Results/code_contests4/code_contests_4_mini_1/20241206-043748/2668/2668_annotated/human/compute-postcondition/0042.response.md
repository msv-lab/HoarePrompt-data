Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains at least 1 tuple, `uniques` now contains the first tuple from `counts` and the tuple at index `i`, `i` is 1, and the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is not equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `counts`; the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is appended to `uniques`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
