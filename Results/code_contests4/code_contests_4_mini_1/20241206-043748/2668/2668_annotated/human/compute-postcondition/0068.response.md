The code snippet `templis.append((subs[y], y + 1))` will append a tuple to the list `templis`. 

1. The variable `y` is currently 0, so `subs[y]` refers to `subs[0]`.
2. The value of `y + 1` is 1.
3. The tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)` becomes `(subs[0], 1)`.

Since `subs` has at least one element, `subs[0]` is defined. The `templis` list, which was initially empty, will now contain this new tuple.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `templis` list with the new tuple added. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is now sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is True, `anss` is True, the first element of `back` is True, `templis` now contains the tuple (subs[0], 1), `y` is 0, and the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i`.**
