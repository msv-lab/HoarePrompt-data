Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of the last successful `func_1` call; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing one tuple: (subs[0], 1) if `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]` and `y` is 0; otherwise, `templis` remains unchanged. `uniques` is a list with at least one element, and for the loop to execute the first time, `subs` is a list with at least 1 element.***
