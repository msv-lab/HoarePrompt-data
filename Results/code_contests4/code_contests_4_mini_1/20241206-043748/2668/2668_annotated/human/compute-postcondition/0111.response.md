According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the length of `subs`. The loop will execute again if `y` is less than the length of `subs`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `subs` contains at least 2 elements. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `subs` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is now `[(subs[0], 1), (subs[1], 2)]`, `y` is 2, and `subs` contains at least 3 elements if `audio[y][0]` is equal to `uniques[i][1]`.**
