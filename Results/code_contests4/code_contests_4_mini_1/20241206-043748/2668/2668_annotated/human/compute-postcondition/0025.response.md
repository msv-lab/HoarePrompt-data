The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged for the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `init` and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop.**
