The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of `func_1(...)`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)`, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is 0, and `back[0]` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
