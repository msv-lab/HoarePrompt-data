Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`, `uniques` is now sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `audio` is a list of integers, `subs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is True, `anss` is True, the first element of `back` is True, `templis` contains the tuples (subs[0], 1) and (subs[1], 2), `y` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time the length of `subs` is greater than 1. If `audio[y][0]` equals `uniques[i][1]`, then the conditions and values described above remain unchanged, confirming the correspondence between the elements of `audio` and `uniques`.***
