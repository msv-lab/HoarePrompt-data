Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers; `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least one element; `counts` contains tuples of (count, integer) representing unique counts from `init`; `uniques` is sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements; `audio` is a list of integers; `subs` is now sorted; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` contains pairs `(subs[y], y + 1)` for matches found; `i` is 1; if the first element of `back` is True, then `res` remains True, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
