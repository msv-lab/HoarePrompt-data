Output State: **`back` is the result of the last successful call to `func_1` where `res` is True if at least one call to `func_1` returned a result with its first element as True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from that successful call; `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided; `z` is the index of the last executed iteration, which is one less than the length of `uniques` if the loop executed completely, or less if it broke early. If the loop did not execute at all because `uniques` is empty, then `back` remains as the result of the last successful `func_1` call, `res` remains True, `anss` remains as `back`, and `z` is -1.**
