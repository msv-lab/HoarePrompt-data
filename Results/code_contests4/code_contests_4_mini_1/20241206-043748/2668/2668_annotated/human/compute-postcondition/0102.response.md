The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the value returned by the previous invocation of `func_1`. The other variables (`back`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.

Output State: **`back` is assigned from `func_1`, `back[0]` is True, `res` is True, and `anss` is assigned the value of `back`.**
