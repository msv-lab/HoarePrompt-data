The line of code appends a tuple to the list `counts`. The first element of the tuple is derived from the last element of `counts`, specifically the first element of that tuple (which is an integer) increased by 1. The second element of the tuple is the value of `init[i]`, where `i` is 1, meaning it refers to the second element of the `init` list.

Since `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least one element, the second element `init[1]` is well-defined. The impact of this line of code does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `m`, `b`, or `c`. However, it modifies `counts` by appending a new tuple.

Therefore, the output state should reflect the change in `counts` while noting the previous values of the elements involved in constructing the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `init`; `counts` is modified to include a tuple of (previous count + 1, init[1])**.
