Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of movies, `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, `c` is a list of `m` positive integers, `init` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` contains at least 1 tuple, `uniques` contains the first tuple from `counts` and the tuple at index `i`, where `i` is 1. If `i + 1` equals the length of `counts`, the tuple at index `i` in `counts` is appended to `uniques`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
