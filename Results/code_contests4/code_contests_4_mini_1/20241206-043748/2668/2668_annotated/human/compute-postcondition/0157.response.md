The variable `anss` is assigned the value of `back`. Since `back` is already defined as the result of the call to `func_1`, `anss` will take on whatever value `back` has. The initial state indicates that `back` is the result of a function call, and its first element is True. Therefore, `anss` will reflect the same value as `back`.

Other variables (`res`, `templis`, `z`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `back` is the result of the call to `func_1` with the specified arguments; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided; `z` is 0; the first element of `back` is True; and `res` remains True.

Output State: **`back` is the result of the call to `func_1` with the arguments `uniques[0][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`; `res` is True; `anss` is assigned the value of `back`; `templis` is a list containing tuples based on the conditions provided; `z` is 0; the first element of `back` is True; and `res` remains True.**
