#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer representing the number of scientists, lis1 is a list of positive integers representing the languages known by each scientist, low is a positive integer representing the number of movies, and high is a list of pairs of positive integers where each pair represents the audio and subtitle languages of each movie.

    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1, indicating that 'num' is not present in 'lis1' and the search space has been exhausted.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of pairs `lis1` representing known languages for scientists, a positive integer `low`, and a positive integer `high`. It performs a binary search on `lis1` to determine if `num` is present as the first element of any pair in `lis1`. If found, it returns `True` along with the second element of the corresponding pair; if not found, it returns `False` and -1. Note that the function does not handle cases where `num` could potentially be outside the bounds of the `lis1` list, nor does it ensure that `low` and `high` are valid indices for `lis1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the languages known by scientists, a positive integer `m`, and two lists of `m` positive integers representing the audio and subtitle languages of movies. It processes the relationship between the languages known by scientists and the languages used in movies, attempting to find matches between them. If a match is found, it returns the index of the matching language from the last successful check; otherwise, it defaults to returning 1. The function also handles input and output through files, writing the result to 'output.txt' if it exists, or printing to standard output if it does not.
