The function accepts a positive integer `num`, a list of pairs `lis1` representing known languages for scientists, a positive integer `low`, and a positive integer `high`. It performs a binary search on `lis1` to determine if `num` is present as the first element of any pair in `lis1`. If found, it returns `True` along with the second element of the corresponding pair; if not found, it returns `False` and -1. Note that the function does not handle cases where `num` could potentially be outside the bounds of the `lis1` list, nor does it ensure that `low` and `high` are valid indices for `lis1`.
