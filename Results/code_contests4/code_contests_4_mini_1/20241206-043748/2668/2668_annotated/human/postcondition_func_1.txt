The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the languages known by scientists, a positive integer `m`, and two lists of `m` positive integers representing the audio and subtitle languages of movies. It processes the relationship between the languages known by scientists and the languages used in movies, attempting to find matches between them. If a match is found, it returns the index of the matching language from the last successful check; otherwise, it defaults to returning 1. The function also handles input and output through files, writing the result to 'output.txt' if it exists, or printing to standard output if it does not.
