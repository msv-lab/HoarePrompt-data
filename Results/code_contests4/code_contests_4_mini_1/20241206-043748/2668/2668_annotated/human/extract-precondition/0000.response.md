Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of scientists (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), a is a list of n positive integers where each integer ai represents the language index known by the i-th scientist (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9), m is a positive integer representing the number of movies (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), b is a list of m positive integers where each integer bj represents the audio language index of the j-th movie (1 ≤ bj ≤ 10^9), and c is a list of m positive integers where each integer cj represents the subtitles language index of the j-th movie (1 ≤ cj ≤ 10^9), with the condition that bj ≠ cj for each movie.**
