#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple datasets, starting with a positive integer N indicating the number of datasets, followed by N rows of 10 integers each, where each integer is between 1 and 10, representing the order of balls to be dropped.
def func():
    n = input()
    data = []
    for i in range(n):
        tmp = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        data.append(tmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `data` contains `n` map objects where each object represents a list of integers from the input, and `i` is equal to `n` after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer N from input, which indicates the number of datasets. It then collects N rows of integers, each containing 10 integers between 1 and 10, and stores these inputs in a list. However, the function does not return any results or perform any processing on the collected datasets, rendering it incomplete in terms of functionality. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid inputs or cases where N is not a positive integer.
