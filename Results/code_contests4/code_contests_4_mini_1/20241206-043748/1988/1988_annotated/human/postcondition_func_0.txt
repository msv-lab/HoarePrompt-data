The function reads an integer N from input, which indicates the number of datasets. It then collects N rows of integers, each containing 10 integers between 1 and 10, and stores these inputs in a list. However, the function does not return any results or perform any processing on the collected datasets, rendering it incomplete in terms of functionality. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid inputs or cases where N is not a positive integer.
