The function `func` accepts multiple datasets, starting with a positive integer `N` that indicates the number of datasets. Each dataset consists of 10 integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10, representing the order of balls to be dropped. After processing these datasets, the function returns the results based on the order of balls. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `N` indicating the number of datasets, followed by `N` rows of 10 integers each (ranging from 1 to 10), and return the results based on the processing of these datasets. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N followed by N rows of 10 integers each (between 1 and 10), and returns results based on the processing of these datasets.**
