The `data` list is modified by appending the `tmp` map object to it. Since `tmp` contains integers from the input split by spaces, the `data` list will now contain this map object as a single element. The other variables `n`, `i`, and the contents of `data` before the operation are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `data` now contains the `tmp` map object, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `data` now contains the `tmp` map object, `i` is 0**
