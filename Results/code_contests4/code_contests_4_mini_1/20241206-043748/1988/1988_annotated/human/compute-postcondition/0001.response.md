The variable `data` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` is an input representing the number of datasets, but it is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the `data` variable is now an empty list, and the state of `n` remains the same as the input value. 

Output State: **`n` is an input representing the number of datasets; `data` is an empty list**
