The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by its definition. Instead, it processes multiple datasets, where the first line contains a positive integer N, representing the number of datasets. Each of the following N lines contains exactly 10 integers, all of which are positive numbers. The function processes these datasets accordingly. 

Since the specific output behavior is not described in the provided information, we cannot specify the return values. However, we can summarize that the function is designed to handle these datasets based on the input format.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets where the first line indicates the number of datasets, followed by lines containing exactly 10 positive integers each.**
