The `data` list is modified by appending `tmp`, which is a map object created from the integers converted from the input string `n`. The initial state indicates that `data` is empty, so after the execution, `data` will contain the mapped integers. The values of `n`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing a number, `data` is now a list containing the mapped integers from `n`, `i` is 0, and `tmp` is a map object of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a number; `data` is now a list containing the mapped integers from `n`; `i` is 0; `tmp` is a map object of integers.**
