#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple datasets where the first line contains an integer N (the number of datasets), followed by N lines each containing exactly 10 integers that represent the sequence of balls to drop, with each integer in the range from 1 to 10.
def func():
    n = input()
    data = []
    for i in range(n):
        tmp = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        data.append(tmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representing a non-negative integer, `data` is a list containing `n` iterables of integers converted from the input strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer N from input representing the number of datasets, and then reads N lines, each containing a sequence of 10 integers (ranging from 1 to 10). It stores these sequences in a list called `data`. However, it does not return any results or perform any operations on the sequences of integers.
