The variable `data` is initialized as an empty list. The previous value of `n` does not affect this operation, as it is not being used in the code snippet provided. The state of `n` remains the same while the new variable `data` is created. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing the number of datasets entered by the user; `data` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing the number of datasets entered by the user; `data` is an empty list**
