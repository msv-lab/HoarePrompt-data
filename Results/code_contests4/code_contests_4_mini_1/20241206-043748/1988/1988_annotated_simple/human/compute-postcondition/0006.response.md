The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input string to create an iterable of integers. The previous state of `n`, `data`, and `i` remains unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the creation of the iterable `tmp`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing a number greater than 1, `data` is a list containing `tmp`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is an iterable of integers converted from the input string.**
