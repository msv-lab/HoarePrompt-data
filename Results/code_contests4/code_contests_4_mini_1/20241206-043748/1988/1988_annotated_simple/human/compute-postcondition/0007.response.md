The code `data.append(tmp)` adds the iterable `tmp` to the list `data`. The previous values indicate that `data` is already a list containing `tmp`, and `tmp` consists of integers converted from the input string. Therefore, after executing the code, `data` will now contain `tmp` as an additional element.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing a number greater than 1, `data` contains `tmp` and now includes an additional `tmp`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is an iterable of integers converted from the input string.**
