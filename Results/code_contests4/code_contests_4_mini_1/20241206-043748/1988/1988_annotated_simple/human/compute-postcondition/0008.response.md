According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the string `n` which represents a number greater than 1. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a string representing a number greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it can allow for `i` to be 2. Therefore, the state must reflect that `i` is now 2.

State: **`n` is a string representing a number greater than 2, `data` contains `tmp` and now includes an additional `tmp`, `i` is 2, `tmp` is an iterable of integers converted from the input string.**
