`data` is a list that already contains `tmp`, and the code appends `tmp` to `data`. Since `tmp` is an iterable of integers converted from the input string, `data` will now contain two instances of `tmp`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing a number greater than 2, `data` now contains two instances of `tmp`, `i` is 2, `tmp` is an iterable of integers converted from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing a number greater than 2, `data` now contains two instances of `tmp`, `i` is 2, `tmp` is an iterable of integers converted from the input string.**
