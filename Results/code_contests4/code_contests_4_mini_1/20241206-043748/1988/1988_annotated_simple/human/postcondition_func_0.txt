The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer N from input representing the number of datasets, and then reads N lines, each containing a sequence of 10 integers (ranging from 1 to 10). It stores these sequences in a list called `data`. However, it does not return any results or perform any operations on the sequences of integers.
