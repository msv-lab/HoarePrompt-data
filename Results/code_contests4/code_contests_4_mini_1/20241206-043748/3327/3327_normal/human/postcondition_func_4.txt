The function accepts no parameters and returns an iterable of integers parsed from standard input. These integers represent the edges of a graph as pairs of distinct integers (u_i, v_i), but the function does not handle the case where the input format is incorrect or where there are any constraints violations; it assumes the input is well-formed according to the specified limits (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000).
