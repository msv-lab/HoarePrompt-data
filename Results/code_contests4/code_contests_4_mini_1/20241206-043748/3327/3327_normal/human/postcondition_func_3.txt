The function accepts a list of integers that represents a graph structure, where the first element indicates the number of nodes, the second element indicates the number of edges, and the subsequent pairs represent the edges between nodes. It processes this information by printing the entire list as a space-separated string followed by a newline. The function does not perform any further processing or validation of the graph structure.
