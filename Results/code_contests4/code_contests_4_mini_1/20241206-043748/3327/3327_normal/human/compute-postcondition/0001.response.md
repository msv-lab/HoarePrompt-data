The function `func_5` accepts no parameters. It processes input from the standard input, where `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges. Each edge is represented by a pair of distinct integers (u_i, v_i) within the specified range. After executing the function body, it returns a list of integers parsed from the standard input, representing the edges of the graph as pairs of distinct integers (u_i, v_i). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_5 is to read graph data from standard input and return the edges as a list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers representing the edges of a graph as pairs of distinct integers parsed from standard input.**
