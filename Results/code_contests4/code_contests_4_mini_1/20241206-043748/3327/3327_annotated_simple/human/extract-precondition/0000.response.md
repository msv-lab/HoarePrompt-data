Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), and each edge is represented by two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) indicating a connection between nodes u_i and v_i.**
