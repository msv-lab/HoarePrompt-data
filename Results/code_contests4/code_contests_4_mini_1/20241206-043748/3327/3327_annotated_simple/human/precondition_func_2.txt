n is an integer between 3 and 200,000, and m is an integer between 1 and 200,000, representing the number of edges in an undirected graph with nodes numbered from 1 to n. Each of the next m lines contains two distinct integers u_i and v_i (1 â‰¤ u_i, v_i â‰¤ n) representing an edge between nodes u and v.
