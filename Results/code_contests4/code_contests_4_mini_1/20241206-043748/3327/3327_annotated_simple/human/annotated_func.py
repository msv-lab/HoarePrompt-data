#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), and each edge is represented by two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) indicating a connection between nodes u and v.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer input taken from the user via raw_input()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input taken from the user via raw_input(). It does not handle cases where the input may not be convertible to an integer, which could lead to a ValueError if the user enters non-integer input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 3 to 200,000, m is an integer in the range 1 to 200,000, and each edge (u_i, v_i) consists of integers u_i and v_i in the range 1 to n, where u_i is not equal to v_i.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the user input, where the input consists of space-separated integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts user input consisting of space-separated integers, converts them into a list of integers, and returns this list. There are no checks for the validity of the input, so if the input does not consist solely of integers, it may raise an exception.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 3 and 200,000, and m is an integer between 1 and 200,000, representing the number of edges in an undirected graph with nodes numbered from 1 to n. Each of the next m lines contains two distinct integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n) representing an edge between nodes u and v.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of nodes in an undirected graph, and it outputs the value of `n` to the standard output. However, it does not process any edges or provide any return value, and therefore does not fulfill the expectations implied by the annotations regarding graph edges.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first two integers represent n (the number of nodes) and m (the number of edges), followed by m pairs of integers representing the edges between nodes, with each edge defined by two distinct integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, where the first two integers represent the number of nodes and edges in a graph, followed by pairs of integers representing the edges between those nodes. It then prints the entire list of integers as a space-separated string, followed by a newline. The function does not perform any further processing or validation of the graph structure or its edges.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), and each edge is represented by two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) indicating a connection between nodes u_i and v_i.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers read from standard input, representing the connections between the nodes in the graph.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads integers from standard input, which should represent the connections between nodes in a graph, and returns an iterable of these integers. It does not perform any validation or processing on the input data, so the integrity and correctness of the input depend entirely on the caller.
