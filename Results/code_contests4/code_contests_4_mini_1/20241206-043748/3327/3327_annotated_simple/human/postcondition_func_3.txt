The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, where the first two integers represent the number of nodes and edges in a graph, followed by pairs of integers representing the edges between those nodes. It then prints the entire list of integers as a space-separated string, followed by a newline. The function does not perform any further processing or validation of the graph structure or its edges.
