arr is a list of integers where the first two integers represent n (the number of nodes) and m (the number of edges), followed by m pairs of integers representing the edges between nodes, with each edge defined by two distinct integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i) such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000.
