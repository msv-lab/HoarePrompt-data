arr is a list of integers where the first two integers represent n (the number of nodes) and m (the number of edges), followed by m pairs of integers representing edges between nodes, with 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i. The values of n must be in the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the number of edges m must be in the range 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000.
