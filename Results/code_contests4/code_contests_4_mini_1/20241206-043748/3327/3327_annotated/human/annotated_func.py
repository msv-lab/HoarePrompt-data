#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), and each edge is represented by a pair of integers (u_i, v_i) such that 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user via raw_input()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input from the user via `raw_input()`. It does not handle any exceptions that may arise from invalid input, such as entering non-integer values, which could lead to a ValueError.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. The graph is defined by m edges, each represented by a pair of integers (u_i, v_i) where 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, which represents the edges of the graph defined by integers between 1 and n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, processes a string representing the edges of a graph, and returns a list of integers obtained from splitting that string. It does not validate the input to ensure it adheres to the specified constraints of n and m, nor does it handle potential input errors, such as non-integer values or empty input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. Each edge is represented by two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), indicating that there is an edge between nodes u_i and v_i, and the graph is guaranteed to be simple.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (within the range of 3 to 200,000) and writes the value of `n` to standard output. It does not process any graph edges or return any other values as implied by the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first two integers represent n (the number of nodes) and m (the number of edges), followed by m pairs of integers representing edges between nodes, with 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i. The values of n must be in the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the number of edges m must be in the range 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, which represents a graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges. It prints the contents of the list as a space-separated string followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and for each edge (u_i, v_i), u_i and v_i are integers such that 1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n and u_i ≠ v_i.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers parsed from the input read from standard input, where the input consists of space-separated values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads space-separated integer values from standard input and returns them as a map object of integers, which can be iterated over. It does not return a list directly, as mentioned in the annotations, and thus the output is not a list but rather a map object that can be converted to a list if needed.
