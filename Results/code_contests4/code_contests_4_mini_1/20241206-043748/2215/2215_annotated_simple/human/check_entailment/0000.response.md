Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the program must determine and print the subject of a document based on its content, with the subject being an integer from 1 to 3. However, the program simply prints '3' unconditionally without analyzing any input data, which means it does not assess the subject of the document as required.

In detail:
1. The program lacks functionality to read the document identifier, document name, and document text.
2. It does not implement any logic to ascertain which subject (1, 2, or 3) the document corresponds to, as it only outputs '3' regardless of the input.
3. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of printing the correct subject based on the content of the document.

In conclusion, the program does not correctly identify the subject of the document as specified in the problem description.
