#State of the program right berfore the function call: The document identifier (id) is an integer such that 0 ≤ id ≤ 10^6, the document name is a string, and the document text consists of lines that do not exceed a total size of 10 kilobytes. The subject of the document corresponds to one of the integers 1, 2, or 3.
def func():
    print('3')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and simply prints the string '3' to the output. It does not utilize or validate any of the parameters described in the annotations (id, name, text, or subject).
