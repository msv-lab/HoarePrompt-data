Correctness: **False**.

The program simply prints '3' without any logic to determine the subject of the document based on its content or identifier. This means that it will always output '3' regardless of the input provided. 

For example, if the input is:
```
0
Document Name
This is a sample text.
```
The expected output is supposed to be an integer from 1 to 3 depending on the subject of the document, but the program will always output '3', which does not satisfy the problem requirements. 

Thus, there are multiple potential cases where the program fails to work as expected, making the correctness **False**.
