#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes a document that consists of a document identifier (an integer id where 0 ≤ id ≤ 10^6), a document name (a string), and document text (a string with a maximum size of 10 kilobytes). The subject of the document is guaranteed to be an integer from 1 to 3.
def func():
    print('3')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and simply prints '3' to the console. It does not process any documents or handle any identifiers, names, or text as described in the annotations. Therefore, the functionality described in the annotations is incorrect and incomplete.
