You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: This problem differs from the previous one only in the absence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.

Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers f(a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - 1} b_q), where a_1 ... a_p and b_1 ... b_q are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.

In other words, the function f(x, y) alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers x and y by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number y. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.

For example: $$$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212 f(7777, 888) = 7787878 f(33, 44444) = 4443434 f(555, 6) = 5556 f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$$

Formally,

  * if p ≥ q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q; 
  * if p < q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q. 



Mishanya gives you an array consisting of n integers a_i, your task is to help students to calculate ∑_{i = 1}^{n}∑_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j) modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353.
