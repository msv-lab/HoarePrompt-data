The function accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is the base, `y` is the exponent (a positive integer), and `p` is the modulus (a positive integer). It computes `(x raised to the power of y) modulo p`. The function efficiently handles large values of `y` using exponentiation by squaring, ensuring that the result `res` is calculated correctly even for large inputs, as it continuously reduces `x` and `res` modulo `p` during the computation.
