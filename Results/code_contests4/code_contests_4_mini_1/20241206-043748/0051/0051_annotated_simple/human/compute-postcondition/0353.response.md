The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the loop is set to execute a fourth time and `i` is currently 3, the execution will skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and move to the next iteration, where `i` will be incremented. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 3 and will be incremented; `res` is 0; `x` is the length of `item`.
