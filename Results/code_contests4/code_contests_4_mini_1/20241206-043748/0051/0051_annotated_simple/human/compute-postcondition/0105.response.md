According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the program state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]`; `x` remains unchanged or becomes more negative; `x` is assigned the value `zs[-1] + 1**
