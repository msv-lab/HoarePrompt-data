The value of `x` is updated by performing the operation `x -= x & -x`. The value of `x` is currently `zs[i] + 1`. The operation `x & -x` computes the lowest set bit of `x`, and when subtracted from `x`, it effectively reduces `x` by that lowest set bit. The exact new value of `x` cannot be calculated without knowing the specific value of `zs[i]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `x` without specifying a definitive numeric value.

Output State: **`us[i]` is increased by `ts[zs[i]]`, `x` is updated by subtracting the lowest set bit from `zs[i] + 1`**.
