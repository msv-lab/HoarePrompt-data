According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the program state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states as the loop can proceed without any changes.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
