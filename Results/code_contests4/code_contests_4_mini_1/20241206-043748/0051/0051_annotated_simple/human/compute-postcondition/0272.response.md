The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 10, so after execution, `i` becomes 9. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is now at least 10; `i` is 9; `res` is 0.
