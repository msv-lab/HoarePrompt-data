According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need for any adjustments to the program state.

State: **`x` is updated to a new value greater than its previous value; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]` for the last time before breaking; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement.**
