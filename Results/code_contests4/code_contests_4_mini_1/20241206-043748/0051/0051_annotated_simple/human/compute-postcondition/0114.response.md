The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `zs[-1] + 1`, `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]`, and `us[i]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]`; `x` is updated to `x - (x & -x)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
