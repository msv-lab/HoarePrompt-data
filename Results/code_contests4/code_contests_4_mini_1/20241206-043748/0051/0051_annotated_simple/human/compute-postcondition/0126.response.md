The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to a new value greater than its previous value; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]` for the last time before breaking; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
