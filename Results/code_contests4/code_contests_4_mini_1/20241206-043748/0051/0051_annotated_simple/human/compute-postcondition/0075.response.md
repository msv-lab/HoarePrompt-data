The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `us[i]` is increased by `ts[zs[i]]`, `x` is updated by subtracting the lowest set bit from `zs[i] + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
