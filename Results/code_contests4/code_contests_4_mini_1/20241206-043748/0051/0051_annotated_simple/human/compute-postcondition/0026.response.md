The variable `sign` is assigned the value of 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is 0, `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` or a lambda function, `A` contains the value of `sign * numb`, `i` is increased by 1, `numb` is 0, and `sign` is 1.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` or a lambda function, `A` contains the value of `sign * numb`, `i` is increased by 1, `numb` is 0, and `sign` is 1.**
