Postcondition: ***`x` is less than or equal to 0. If `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, `ts` is updated at index `x - 1` by incrementing its value by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `x` remains unchanged after the operation, it stays less than or equal to 0.***
