Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 3; `x` is the length of `item`; and `res` is 0. If the length of `item` (x) is less than or equal to 3, `res` is updated based on the calculation `ans = ans + arr[i - 1] * res`. Otherwise, `j` is set to -1 and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2] * res`.***
