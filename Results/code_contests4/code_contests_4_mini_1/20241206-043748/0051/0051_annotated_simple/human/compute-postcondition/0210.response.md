The value of `x` is assigned the length of `item`. Since `item` is the second string in `l1`, the value of `x` will be equal to the number of characters in that string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10.**
