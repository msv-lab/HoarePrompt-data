According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, `us[i]` is updated based on contributions from `ts`, and `ts` has been modified with each iteration reflecting the number of executed iterations; `i` remains `len(xs) - 1 - k - 1**
