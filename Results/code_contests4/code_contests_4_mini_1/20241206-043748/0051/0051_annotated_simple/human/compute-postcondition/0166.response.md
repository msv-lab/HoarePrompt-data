To calculate the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings.
   - `item` is the second string in `l1`.
   - `x` is the length of `item` (with \(x \geq 1\) for the loop to execute).
   - `res` is updated to 0.
   - `ans` is the accumulated result from all iterations.
   - `i` is 1.
   - \(x\) is less than or equal to \(i\).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code updates `res` using the formula provided. The value `res` is updated to:
     \[
     res = (res + int(item[j]) \times pow(10, (x - j - 1) \times 2, mod)) \mod mod
     \]
   - Here, `int(item[j])` extracts the integer value of the character at index `j` in the string `item`.
   - `pow(10, (x - j - 1) \times 2, mod)` computes \(10\) raised to the power of \((x - j - 1) \times 2\) modulo `mod`.
   - The overall result is taken modulo `mod`.

3. **Variable Changes**:
   - `res` will be updated based on the calculations done with the values of `item`, `x`, and `mod`.
   - The actual values of `item`, `mod`, and the iteration variable `j` are not specified, but we can state that `res` will be updated based on the calculations done with these values.

4. **Output State**:
   - The value of `res` changes, but without knowing the specific values of `item`, `j`, and `mod`, we can only describe that `res` is updated based on the loop iteration. 
   - The other variables remain unaffected in this context.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the formula using `item`, `x`, `mod`, and the current index `j`**.
