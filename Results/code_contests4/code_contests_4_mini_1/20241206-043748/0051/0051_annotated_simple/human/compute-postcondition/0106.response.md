The value of `us[i]` is incremented by the value of `ts[x - 1]`. Since `i` is -1, this means we are updating `us[-1]`. The value of `x` is either less than or equal to 0, and it remains unchanged or becomes more negative, which means `x - 1` is less than or equal to -1. Therefore, `ts[x - 1]` will access an index in the `ts` list that is less than or equal to -1. The states of `x` and `i` are not changed by this operation, and `us[-1]` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than or equal to 0; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]`, and `x` remains unchanged or becomes more negative.

Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]`, and `x` remains unchanged or becomes more negative.**
