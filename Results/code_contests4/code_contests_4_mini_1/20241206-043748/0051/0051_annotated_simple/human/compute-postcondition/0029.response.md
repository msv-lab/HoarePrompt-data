Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0, `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function otherwise, `A` is an empty list, and `i` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, `numb` is updated to `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`. If `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`, `i` is increased by 1, and if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is set to -1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'-'[0]` and also not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, then `A` contains the value of `sign * numb`, `i` is increased by 1, `numb` is reset to 0, and `sign` is set to 1.***
