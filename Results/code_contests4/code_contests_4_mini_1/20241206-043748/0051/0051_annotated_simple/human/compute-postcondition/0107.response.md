The expression `x -= x & -x` performs a bitwise operation on `x`. Since `x` is less than or equal to 0, the value of `x & -x` will be 0 (as for non-positive numbers, the result of this operation will yield 0). Therefore, `x` remains unchanged after the operation.

The value of `i` and the state of `us[-1]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]`, and `x` remains unchanged.**
