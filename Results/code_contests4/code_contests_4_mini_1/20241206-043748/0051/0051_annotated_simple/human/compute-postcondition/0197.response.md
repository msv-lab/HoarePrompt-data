Output State: **`x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the last character of `item` multiplied by `pow(10, -2, mod)`, `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is accumulated from all iterations, `i` is 1, `j` is 0; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j + (x - i)]`, `pow(10, (i - j) * 2 - 1, mod)`, and `mod`.**
