The expression `x += x & -x` updates the value of `x` by adding the result of `x & -x` to it. The operation `x & -x` isolates the lowest set bit of `x`, which is a positive value since `x` is greater than 0. Therefore, `x` is incremented by this positive value. The value of `i` and `us[-1]` is unaffected by this operation, but `ts[x - 1]` has been incremented by 1 before this operation, and its value remains unchanged.

Given that `x` is greater than 0, the output state reflects the updated value of `x` after the operation. 

Output State: **`x` is updated to a new value greater than its previous value; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]` for the last time before breaking; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1**
