Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `res` is updated based on the calculations involving `item`, `x`, and `mod`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on all characters of `item`, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, `i` is equal to the length of `item`, and `j` is -1.***
