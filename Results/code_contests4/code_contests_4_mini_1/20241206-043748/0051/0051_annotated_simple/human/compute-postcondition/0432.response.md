The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `item`, `x`, `j`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 4; `x` is 3; `j` is 1; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving the last values of `item[j]`, `x`, `i`, and `mod` after all iterations of the loop.
