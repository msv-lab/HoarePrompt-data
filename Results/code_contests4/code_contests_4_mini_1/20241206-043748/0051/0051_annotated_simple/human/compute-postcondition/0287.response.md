The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 9, so after execution, `i` becomes 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is 9; `i` is 10; `res` is the accumulated value from the computations done in the loop; `j` is 2.
