Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `i` is 2, `res` is computed, and `ans` is the accumulated result. If the element at index `i - 1` of `arr` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes to `res` or `ans`.***
