To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial values of the variables.

1. The variable `ans` is being updated by adding the value of `arr[i - 1] * res`. 
2. From the initial state, we know `i` is 10, so `i - 1` equals 9.
3. The code implies there is a list `arr`, and we are accessing the 9th index of this list, which depends on the contents of `arr`.
4. The variable `res` is already computed based on some prior computations involving the string `item` and the indices from `j = 2` to `j = 0`. The exact value of `res` is not specified, but it is assumed to be calculated prior to this line of code.
5. The variable `ans` will now have its value updated. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, so we can only note that it will increase by the product of `arr[9]` and `res`.

Since we lack specific values for `arr`, `res`, and `ans`, we can only describe the impact:

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[9] * res`, where `arr` is a list, `res` is computed from prior logic, and `ans` is modified accordingly.**
