Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is a string of length 1 or 2; `i` is 2; `res` is updated based on `int(item[j])` and `pow(10, (x - j) * 2 - 1, mod)`; `ans` is computed; `x` is the length of `item`; `j` is either 1 or 0; `res` is updated accordingly.**
