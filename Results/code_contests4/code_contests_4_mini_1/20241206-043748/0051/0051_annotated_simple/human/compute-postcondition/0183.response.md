The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item`, `x` is at least 0, `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is accumulated from previous iterations, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
