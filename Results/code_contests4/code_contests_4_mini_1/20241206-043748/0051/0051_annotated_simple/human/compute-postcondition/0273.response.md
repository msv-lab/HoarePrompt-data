The variable `j` is initialized to 0, which does not affect any of the previous values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is now at least 10; `i` is 9; `res` is 0; `j` is 0.
