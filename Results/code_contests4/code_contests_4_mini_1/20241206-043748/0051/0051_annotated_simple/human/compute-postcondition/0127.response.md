Postcondition: ***`x` is updated to a new value greater than its previous value; if `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, then `i` is -1, `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]` for the last time before breaking, and `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
