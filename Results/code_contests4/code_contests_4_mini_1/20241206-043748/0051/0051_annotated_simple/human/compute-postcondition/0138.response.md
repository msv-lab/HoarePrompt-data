Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `xs`, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 and the length of the list is between 1 and 100,000. It counts how many elements in `xs` are smaller than each element that appears after it in the list and returns a list `us` where each element at index `i` represents the count of elements in `xs` that are smaller than `xs[i]` and appear after it. **
