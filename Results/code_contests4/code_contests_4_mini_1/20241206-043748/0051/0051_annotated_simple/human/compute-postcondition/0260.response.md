The calculation involves the variable `res`, which is updated using the formula provided. The initial values are:

- `res` is 0
- `item` is the second string in `l1`
- `j` is `x - 1`, where `x` is the length of `item`

1. The `int(item[j])` retrieves the integer value of the last character of `item` since `j = x - 1`.
2. The term `pow(10, (x - j - 1) * 2, mod)` computes \(10^{(x - (x - 1) - 1) * 2} = 10^{0} = 1\) (since \(x - j - 1 = 0\)).
3. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `res = (res + int(item[j]) * 1) % mod`, which is `res = (0 + int(item[x - 1])) % mod`.

Thus, `res` will be assigned the value of `int(item[x - 1]) % mod`. Other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10; `res` is `int(item[x - 1]) % mod; `j` is `x - 1`.**
