Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is updated based on the computations involving all characters of `item` for each iteration; `ans` is the accumulated result from all iterations based on the values in `arr` and the computations of `res`; `i` is 1. If `arr[0]` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without further changes to `res` or `ans`.***
