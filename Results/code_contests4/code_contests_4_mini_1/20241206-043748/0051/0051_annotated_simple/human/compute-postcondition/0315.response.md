Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is a string of length 1 or 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `int(item[0])` and `pow(10, (x - 0) * 2 - 1, mod)`.**
