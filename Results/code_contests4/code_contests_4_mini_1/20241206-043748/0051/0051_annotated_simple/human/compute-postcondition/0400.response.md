The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Since the condition for the loop to execute a second time is that `i` must be less than 11, if we are indeed inside the loop, it will continue to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `l1`, `item`, `i`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 4; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
