Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 4; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is 0. If `arr[i - 1]` equals 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing any variable values.***
