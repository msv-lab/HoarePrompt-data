Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely unless a break statement is encountered within the loop body. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time; it will proceed as is.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is -1, `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]` for the last time before breaking; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1**
