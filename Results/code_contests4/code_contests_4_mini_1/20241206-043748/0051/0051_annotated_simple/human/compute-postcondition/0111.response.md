Since the loop is a `while True`, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Since we are instructed to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration, no adjustments are necessary for the state to allow the `while True` loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is `zs[-1] + 1`; `i` is -1; `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
