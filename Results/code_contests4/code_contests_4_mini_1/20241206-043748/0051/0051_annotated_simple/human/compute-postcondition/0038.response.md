Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0, `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function otherwise, `A` is an empty list, and `i` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is set to -1. Otherwise, `sign` is set to 1, and if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, then `numb` is set to 0.***
