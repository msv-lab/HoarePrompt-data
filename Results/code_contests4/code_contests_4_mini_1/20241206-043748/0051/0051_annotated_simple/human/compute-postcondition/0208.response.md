The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the remainder of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Given that `i` is set to 10 and the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10, the loop will continue without any changes to the values of `n`, `l1`, `item`, `x`, or `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
