The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 2; `res` is updated to (2 * int(item[0]) * pow(10, x + 3, mod)) % mod; `x` is at least 3; `j` is 1; `x` is decremented by 1.**
