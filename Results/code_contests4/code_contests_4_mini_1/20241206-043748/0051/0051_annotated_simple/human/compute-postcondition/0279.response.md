Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is greater than 9; `i` is 9; `res` is either `2 * digit * pow(10, x + 10, mod) % mod` or a new computed value; `j` is 1; `res` is updated to (res + 2 * int(item[1]) * pow(10, x - 9 + 2 * (9 + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod.**
