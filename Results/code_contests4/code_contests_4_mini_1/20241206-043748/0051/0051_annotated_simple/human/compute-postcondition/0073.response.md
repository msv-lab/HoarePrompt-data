The value of `us[i]` is increased by `ts[x - 1]`, where `x` has already been updated to `zs[i] + 1`. The previous values of `us[i]` and `ts[x - 1]` are not specified, but we know that `x` is derived from `zs[i] + 1`. Since there is no condition that changes the value of `x` in this context, we proceed with the operation.

Considering that `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`, the calculation for `us[i]` now relies on `ts[zs[i]]`, as `x - 1` would reference `zs[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `us[i]` is increased by `ts[zs[i]]`, and `x` is `zs[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`us[i]` is increased by `ts[zs[i]]`, `x` is `zs[i] + 1`**
