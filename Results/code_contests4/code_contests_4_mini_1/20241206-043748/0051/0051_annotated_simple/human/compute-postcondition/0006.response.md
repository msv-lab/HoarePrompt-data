Since the `while` loop is defined as `while True`, it will always execute without any condition that could prevent it from running. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is 0; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from standard input.**
