The variable `x` is assigned the value of the length of `item`. Since `item` is the third string in `l1`, its length will be a positive integer based on the content of that string. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l1`, `i`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 3; `res` is 0; `x` is the length of `item`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 3; `res` is 0; `x` is the length of `item`.**
