Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely without any conditions that could prevent it from starting. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the state right before the loop.

State: **`ts` is a list of zeros with the last element incremented by 1 for each executed iteration; `us` is updated based on contributions from `ts`; `i` is `len(xs) - 1 - k - 1`; `x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1.**
