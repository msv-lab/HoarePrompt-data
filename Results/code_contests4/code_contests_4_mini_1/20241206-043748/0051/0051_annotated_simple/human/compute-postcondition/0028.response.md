Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0, `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function otherwise, `A` is an empty list, and `i` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is -1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'-'[0]`, and also not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, then `A` contains the value of `sign * numb`, `i` is increased by 1, `numb` is 0, and `sign` is 1.***
