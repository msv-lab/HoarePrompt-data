The variable `j` is initialized to `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, as no other variables are impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `i` is 9; `res` is 0; the length of `item` is greater than 10; `j` is 0.
