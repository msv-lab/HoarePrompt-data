Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `i` is 2, `res` is 0, and `x` is the length of `item`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`. Otherwise, `res` is the cumulative result computed from the integer values of `item[x - 1]` and `item[x - 2]`, `j` is -1, `i` remains 2, `x` is the length of `item`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[1] * res`.***
