Postcondition: ***`x` is less than or equal to 0. If `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, then `us[i]` is updated based on contributions from `ts`, `ts` has been modified with each iteration reflecting the number of executed iterations, and `i` remains `len(xs) - 1 - k - 1`. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
