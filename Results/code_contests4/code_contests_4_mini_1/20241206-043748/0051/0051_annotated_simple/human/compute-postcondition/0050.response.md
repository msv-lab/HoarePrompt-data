Output State: **`ts` is a list of zeros with the last element incremented by 1; `us` is updated based on contributions from `ts`; `i` is `len(xs) - 1 - k`; if `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, then `x` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
