The variable `x` is assigned the value of `len(item)`, which calculates the length of the string stored in `item`. The initial state specifies that `item` is the second string in `l1`, and since `l1` contains at least 2 strings, `x` will be a positive integer representing the length of that string. The values of other variables (`n`, `i`, `res`, and the list `l1`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10; `res` is 0; `x` is the length of `item`.**
