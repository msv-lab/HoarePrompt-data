The variable `j` is initialized to `0`. The values of other variables (`n`, `l1`, `item`, `i`, `res`, `ans`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 1; `res` is 0; `ans` is computed; `x` is the length of `item`, and the length of `item` is greater than 2; `j` is 0.
