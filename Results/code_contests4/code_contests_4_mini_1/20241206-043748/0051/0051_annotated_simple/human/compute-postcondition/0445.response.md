Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 4; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is computed based on the characters of `item`. If `x` is less than or equal to 4, then `ans` is updated by adding `arr[3] * res`. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on calculations involving all relevant indices of `item`, `i` is 4, `j` is -1, and `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[3] * res.***
