The variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i - 1` equals 1. The value of `arr[1]` is retrieved, and since `res` is already defined based on the characters in `item`, the exact values of `arr[1]` and `res` are needed for the calculation. However, the values of `arr` and `res` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only determine the relationship without specific values.

Thus, the Output State is: `ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[1] * res`**.
