Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 1; `res` is updated; `ans` is computed; `x` is (previous value - 1); `j` is 1; `res` is now (previous `res` + 2 * int(item[j]) * pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod.**
