The value of `x` is assigned the length of `item`. Given that `item` is the third string in the list `l1`, the length of `item` will be a positive integer based on the number of characters in that string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 4; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 4; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is 0**
