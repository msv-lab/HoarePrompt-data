Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is 0; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned the value of the input read from standard input; and the character at position `i` in `s` is less than b'0'[0] and equals b'-'[0].***
