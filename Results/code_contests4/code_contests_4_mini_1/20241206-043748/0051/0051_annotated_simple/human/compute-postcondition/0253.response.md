Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10; `res` is 0. If the length of `item` (x) is less than or equal to 10, `ans` is updated based on `ans + arr[9] * res`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[9] * res` where `res` is the final accumulated value based on the characters of `item`, `i` is 10, and `j` is -1.***
