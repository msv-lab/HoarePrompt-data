`x` is assigned the value of `len(item)`, where `item` is the third string in the list `l1`. Since `item` is a string, `len(item)` calculates the number of characters in that string. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l1`, `i`, `res`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `i` is 2, `res` is computed, `ans` is the accumulated result, `x` is the length of `item`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `i` is 2, `res` is computed, `ans` is the accumulated result, `x` is the length of `item`**.
