The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the values of the variables do not change, the output state remains the same with the loop still set to execute again as `i` is less than 11. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10; `res` is 0; and the loop continues to execute.
