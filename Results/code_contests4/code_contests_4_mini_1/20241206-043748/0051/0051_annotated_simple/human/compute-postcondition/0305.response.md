The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `i` is 2, `res` is computed, `ans` is the accumulated result, and the element at index `i - 1` of `arr` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
