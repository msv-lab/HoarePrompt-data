Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current program state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states to allow for the next iteration to proceed. 

State: **`ts` is a list of zeros with the last element incremented by 1; `us` is updated based on contributions from `ts`; `i` is `len(xs) - 1 - k`; if `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, then `x` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
