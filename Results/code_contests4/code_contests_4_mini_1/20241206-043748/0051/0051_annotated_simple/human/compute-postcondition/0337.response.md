Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 1; `res` is updated based on all iterations of the loop; `ans` is computed; `x` is 1; the length of `item` is greater than 2; `j` is equal to the length of `item` minus 1; `res` is now equal to the cumulative result of the calculations performed in the loop.**
