To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the current state provided.

The loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
```
This indicates that the loop starts at `j = i - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches `-1`, meaning it will execute while `j` is non-negative.

From the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000.
- `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings.
- `item` is the third string in `l1`.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.
- `res` is updated based on the formula involving `item`, `j`, `x`, and `mod`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently 1. In the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be decremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 0.

Now we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. After the next iteration, `j` will be 0, and for the loop to continue executing, the next value of `j` will be -1, which will end the loop.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be 0.
- The loop will execute once more with `j` equal to 0 before terminating.

The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `item`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged for this context since they do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `item` is the third string in `l1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, `res` is updated based on the formula involving `item`, `j`, `x`, and `mod`.**
