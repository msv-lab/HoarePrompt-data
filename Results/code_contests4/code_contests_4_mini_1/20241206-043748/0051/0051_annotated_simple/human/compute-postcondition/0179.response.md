The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is at least 1; `res` is updated to 0; `ans` is the accumulated result from all iterations based on the values in `arr` and the computations of `res`; `i` is 0; `x` is greater than `i` (x > 1); `j` is 0.
