Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true or a lambda function otherwise; `A` contains the parsed integers from the string `s` followed by 0; `numb` is 0; `sign` is 1; `i` is the length of the string `s`. If the string `s` is not empty and its last character is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then `A` will include the parsed integers from `s` followed by 0.***
