Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function; `A` is an empty list; if the character at index `i` of `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then `numb` is calculated as 10 * 0 + conv(s[0]) - 48, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is less than the ASCII value of '0', then `numb` is 0, `sign` is -1 if the character at position `i` in `s` equals b'-'[0], otherwise `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, and `s` is the input read from standard input, with additional conditions applied to the character at position `i` in `s`.***
