Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 1 string; `item` is the first string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is updated based on all characters of `item`; `j` is -1; if `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` where `i` is less than 10. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` to its current value, where `res` is based on processed characters from `item`, and the previous values of `ans` and `arr` are unknown.***
