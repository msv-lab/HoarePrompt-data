The expression `x -= x & -x` modifies the value of `x` by subtracting the result of `x & -x` from it. The operation `x & -x` gives the least significant bit of `x`, which is a power of 2. Thus, the new value of `x` will be reduced by this least significant bit.

The initial state indicates that `x` has already been updated to `zs[i] + 1`, but since we donâ€™t have the specific values for `zs[i]` or `x` at this point, we can't determine the exact numeric value of `x` after this operation. However, we can conclude that `x` will now hold a value that is one less than the least significant bit of the previous value of `x`.

Given that the operation only affects `x` and does not influence `us[i]` or `ts[x - 1]`, the output state will reflect the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is updated to a value that is one less than the least significant bit of its previous value; `us[i]` remains increased by `ts[x - 1]`.**
