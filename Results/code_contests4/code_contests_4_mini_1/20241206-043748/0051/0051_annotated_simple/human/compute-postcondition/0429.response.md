The value of `x` is decreased by 1. Since `x` is greater than 3, the new value of `x` will remain positive and greater than 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 3; `x` is greater than 2; `j` is increased by 1; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, `x`, `i`, and `mod`.
