The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is now less than or equal to 8; `i` is 9; `j` is 3; previous `res` is updated to (previous `res` + 2 * int(item[2]) * pow(10, x - 9 + 2 * (9 + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod.
