According to the code, the loop iterates over each string in the list `l1`. If `l1` contains at least 1 string, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `item` is the first string in `l1`, and since the loop processes each string in `l1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `item` must be updated to the next string in the list. 

If `l1` has more than one string, the next string will be the second string in the list. The index of the current `item` is based on its position in `l1`. Therefore, if the loop has processed the first string, then to execute again, we need to consider the second string.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the computations involving all characters of `item` for each iteration, `ans` is the accumulated result from all iterations based on the values in `arr` and the computations of `res`.**
