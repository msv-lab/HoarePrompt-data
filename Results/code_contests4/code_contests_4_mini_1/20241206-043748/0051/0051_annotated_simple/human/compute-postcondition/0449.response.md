The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints mentioned, it is implied that it works with `n` as a positive integer and `a` as a list containing `n` integers. The functionality of the function is not clear from the output details provided. Therefore, I cannot specify the exact return values or behavior without additional information about how the function utilizes `n` and `a`. 

Functionality: **The function is implied to work with a positive integer n and a list a of n integers, but the specific return value or behavior is not defined in the provided information.**
