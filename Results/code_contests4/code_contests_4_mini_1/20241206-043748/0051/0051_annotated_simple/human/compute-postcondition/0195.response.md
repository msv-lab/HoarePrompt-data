To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information.

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)`. This means that the loop will start with `j` initialized to `i - 1` and will decrement `j` until it reaches -1. 

2. The initial value of `i` is 1, so `i - 1` equals 0. Consequently, the range for `j` will be `range(0, -1, -1)`, which means `j` will take the value 0 before the loop starts. 

3. Since the loop is set to decrement from 0 to -1 (exclusive), the loop will execute once with `j` equal to 0.

4. The variable `item` is the second string in `l1`, and `x` is the length of `item`. For the loop to execute, we do not need to change `x`, `res`, or `n`, as they are not directly affecting the execution of the loop.

5. The variables `i` and `j` are correctly initialized for the loop to execute. Specifically, `j` starts at 0 and decrements correctly.

Given this analysis, the necessary states can be summarized as follows:

State: **`x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the calculations involving all characters of `item`, `n` is a positive integer, `l1` is a list of strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is accumulated from all iterations, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
