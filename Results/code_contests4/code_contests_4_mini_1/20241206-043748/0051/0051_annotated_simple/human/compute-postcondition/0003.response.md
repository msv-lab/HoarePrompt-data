The value of `sign` is assigned the value 1. This assignment does not affect the previous values of the other variables (`zero`, `conv`, `A`, `numb`), which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer that defaults to 0; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is 0; `sign` is 1.
