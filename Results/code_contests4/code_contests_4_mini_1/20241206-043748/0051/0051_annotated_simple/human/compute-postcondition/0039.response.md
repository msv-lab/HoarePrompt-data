Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0, `conv` is a function, and `A` is an empty list. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, then `numb` is assigned the value `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, with `numb` being undefined initially. If `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`, `i` is increased by 1, and if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is set to -1; otherwise, `sign` is set to 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, then `numb` is set to 0.***
