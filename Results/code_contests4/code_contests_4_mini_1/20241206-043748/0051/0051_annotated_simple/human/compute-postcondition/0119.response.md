The value of `x` is updated by adding `x & -x` to it. Since `x` is greater than 0, `x & -x` will result in a positive integer value depending on the least significant bit set in `x`. Therefore, `x` is increased by this value. The previous values of `i` and `us[-1]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is -1, `us[-1]` is updated by `ts[x - 1]` for the last time before breaking, and `x` is increased by `x & -x`.**
