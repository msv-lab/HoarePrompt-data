`x` is assigned the value of `len(item)`, which calculates the length of the string stored in `item`. The value of `item` is the second string in the list `l1`, but the specific length is unknown as it depends on the content of `item`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `res`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10; `res` is the accumulated value from the computations done in the loop; `j` is 2.
