The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l1`, `item`, `x`, `i`, `res`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is now greater than 8; `i` is 9; `res` is either `2 * digit * pow(10, x + 10, mod) % mod` or a new computed value; `j` is 2; `res` is updated to (res + 2 * int(item[1]) * pow(10, x - 9 + 2 * (9 + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod.**
