According to the code, the loop iterates through `j` starting from `i - 1` down to `0`. The loop will execute again if `j` can be decremented once more. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0` (because the loop runs in reverse). For the loop to execute once more, `j` must be set to `-1`. However, since `j` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to execute, it indicates that the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, the state must indicate that the loop has completed all its iterations.

State: **`res` is updated based on the integer value of `item[j + (x - i)]`, and the previous value of `res` is added to it, then taken modulo `mod`, for the loop to execute again j must be -1, but the loop has finished all its iterations.**
