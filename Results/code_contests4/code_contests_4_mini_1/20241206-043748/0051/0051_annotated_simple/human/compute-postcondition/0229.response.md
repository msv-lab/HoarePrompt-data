The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is `len(item) - 1`, which is a non-negative integer since `item` is a string. Therefore, the new value of `x` will be `len(item) - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is `len(item) - 2`; `i` is 9; `res` is updated based on the calculation; `j` is 0**
