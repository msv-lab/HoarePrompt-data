Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least one time regardless of the state of the program. Thus, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute. 

State: **`x` is `zs[-1] + 1`, where `zs[-1]` must be less than or equal to -1, meaning `x` remains less than or equal to 0; `i` is -1**
