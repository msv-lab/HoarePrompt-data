Output State: **`ts` is a list where each element reflects the cumulative count of contributions from previous indices, `us` is updated based on contributions from `ts` throughout all iterations, `i` is -1 after processing all indices in `xs`, and `x` is greater than the length of `ts` after the last iteration of the loop.**
