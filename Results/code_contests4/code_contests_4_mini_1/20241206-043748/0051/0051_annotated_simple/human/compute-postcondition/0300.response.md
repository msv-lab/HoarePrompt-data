Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10; `res` is computed based on the formula provided for all characters in `item` if `x` is less than or equal to 10, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`. If `x` is greater than 10, then `ans` is updated by adding `arr[9] * res`, where `arr` is a list and `res` is computed from prior logic.***
