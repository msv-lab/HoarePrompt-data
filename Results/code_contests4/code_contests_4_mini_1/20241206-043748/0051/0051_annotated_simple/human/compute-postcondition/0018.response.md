Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0; `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function; `A` is an empty list or [0]; `numb` is 0; `sign` is -1 if the character at position `i` in `s` equals b'-'[0], otherwise `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is the input read from standard input, and the character at position `i` in `s` is less than b'0'[0]. If the character at position `i` in `s` is not equal to b'-'[0], the character at position `i` in `s` is not equal to b'\r'[0], and these conditions remain true.***
