Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer that defaults to 0, `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` or a lambda function, `A` is [0], `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, `s` is the input read from standard input, and the character at position `i` in `s` is less than b'0'[0] and not equal to b'-'[0]. If the character at position `i` in `s` is not equal to b'\r'[0], these conditions remain true.***
