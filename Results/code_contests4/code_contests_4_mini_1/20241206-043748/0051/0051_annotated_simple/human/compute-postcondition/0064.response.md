Postcondition: ***`ts` is a list of zeros with the last element incremented by 1 for each executed iteration; `us` is updated based on contributions from `ts`; `i` is `len(xs) - 1 - k - 1`; `x` is updated to `x - (x & -x)`, and if `x` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
