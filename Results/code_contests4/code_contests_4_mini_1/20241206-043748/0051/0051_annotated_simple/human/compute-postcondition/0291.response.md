To compute the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000.
   - `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings.
   - `item` is the second string in `l1`.
   - `x` is the length of `item`.
   - `i` is 10.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `res` is updated based on the computation involving `item`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The expression `int(item[j + (x - i)])` indicates we are accessing a character in `item` at the index `j + (x - i)`. 
   - The index calculation involves:
     - `x` is the length of `item`.
     - `i` is 10.
     - `j` is 2.
   - Therefore, the effective index is `2 + (x - 10)`, which can be simplified to `x - 8`.
   - The value `pow(10, (i - j) * 2 - 1, mod)` computes `10` raised to the power of `(10 - 2) * 2 - 1` modulo `mod`. This simplifies to `pow(10, 15, mod)`.

3. **Variables Impact**:
   - The variable `res` will be updated based on the calculation involving the above components.
   - Since `item` is a string and we are accessing its character, we assume `item[j + (x - i)]` (or `item[x - 8]`) is a valid index, meaning `x` should be at least 8.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The output state will reflect the updated value of `res` after performing the computation.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 10; `j` is 2; `res` is updated based on the computation involving `item[j + (x - i)] * pow(10, 15, mod) % mod**.
