Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings; `item` is the third string in `l1`; `i` is 11; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is the final computed result based on the characters of `item` for the last iteration; `ans` is the accumulated result from all iterations, updated based on the values in `arr` and the computations of `res`.**
