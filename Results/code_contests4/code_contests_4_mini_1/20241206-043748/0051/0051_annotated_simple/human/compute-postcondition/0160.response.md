The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since the context does not provide details about the surrounding loop or conditions, we will assume that we are still within a loop structure.

The values of the variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects that we are still within the loop, and we are skipping to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is updated based on the computations involving all characters of `item` for each iteration; `ans` is the accumulated result from all iterations based on the values in `arr` and the computations of `res`; `i` is 1; the element at index `i - 1` of `arr` is 0 (i.e., `arr[0] == 0`); and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
