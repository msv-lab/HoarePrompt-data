#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each string representing an integer. It calculates a result based on the lengths and values of these strings, incorporating modular arithmetic with a modulus of 998244353. The function ultimately prints the computed result, but does not return any value. The specific logic for how the result is computed involves evaluating string lengths and performing calculations based on their numeric values, but the exact interpretation of the calculations is not clearly defined in the annotations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is the base, `y` is the exponent (a positive integer), and `p` is the modulus (a positive integer). It computes `(x raised to the power of y) modulo p`. The function efficiently handles large values of `y` using exponentiation by squaring, ensuring that the result `res` is calculated correctly even for large inputs, as it continuously reduces `x` and `res` modulo `p` during the computation.

The integers are derived from sequences of numeric characters in `s`, with support for negative numbers indicated by a '-' sign. The function handles input until a non-numeric character is encountered and appends the last parsed number to the list if the string ends with a numeric character. If the input string is empty or does not contain valid integers, the function will return an empty list.
