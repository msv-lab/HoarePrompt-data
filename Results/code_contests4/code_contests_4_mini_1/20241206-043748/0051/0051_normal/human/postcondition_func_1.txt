The function accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. It computes the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`, which means it calculates (x^y) % p. The function returns the result of this calculation. The annotations incorrectly state that it returns 1 when `y` is 0; however, this function will return the correct result for any valid positive integer values of `x`, `y`, and `p`. If `y` is 0, the function will still correctly compute the result modulo `p` as 1, since x^0 = 1 for any x.
