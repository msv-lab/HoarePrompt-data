The function accepts an integer `zero` and reads a sequence of bytes, parsing integers from that sequence. It returns a list `A` containing all the parsed integers, adjusted by their respective signs (positive or negative). If the sequence ends with a valid number, that number is included in the list. The function handles potential exceptions during parsing but does not explicitly manage or report errors if the sequence is invalid.
