According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `x - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `x - 1` in the next iteration and must be decremented in the loop. Thus, in the next iteration, `j` will be `x - 2 - 1 = x - 3`.

At the start of the next iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be at least 0. Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3, so that `j` can correctly decrement to -1 after the last iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`, which must be at least 3; `j` is `x - 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be `x - 2` and for `x` to be at least 3.**
