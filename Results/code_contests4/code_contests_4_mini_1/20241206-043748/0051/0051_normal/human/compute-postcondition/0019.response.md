Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer. If the character at position `i` in `s` is a digit, then `numb` is updated to `10 * zero + conv(s[i]) - 48`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 0. If the character is equal to '-', then `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`, `sign` is -1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `numb` remains equal to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, and if the character at position `i` in `s` is not equal to the ASCII value of carriage return (b'\r'), then `A` remains unchanged.***
