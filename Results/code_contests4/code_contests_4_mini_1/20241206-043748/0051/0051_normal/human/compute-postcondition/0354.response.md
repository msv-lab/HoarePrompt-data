Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 12 strings; `item` is the 12th string in `l1` with length 1; `i` is 2; `x` is 1; `ans` and `res` are updated based on the previous iteration calculations. If `arr[i - 1]` equals 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
