The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`res`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item`, `i` is decreased by 1, `j` is 1; `x` is updated to the length of `item` - 2.**
