`x` is assigned the value of `len(item)`, where `item` is the second string in `l1`. The length of `item` will determine the value of `x`, but since the exact value of `item` is not specified, `x` can be any positive integer depending on the length of `item`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is now 1; `x` is the length of `item`.
