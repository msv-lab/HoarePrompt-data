According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop body. Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again, the program state from the previous iteration can simply be repeated as is.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `us` remains a list of zeros with length equal to `len(xs)`; `i` is `len(xs) - 1`; `ts` is a list initialized with zeros with a length of `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`**
