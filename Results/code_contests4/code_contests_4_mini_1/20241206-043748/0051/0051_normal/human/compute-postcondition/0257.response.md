The variable `x` is assigned the value of `len(item)`, which calculates the length of the string stored in `item`. Since `item` is the second string in `l1`, `x` will hold the integer value representing the length of that string. The values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 1; `j` will range from 0 to -1; `ans` is updated based on the calculations of the previous iteration; if `arr[i - 1]` equals 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
