The variable `x` is assigned the value of `len(item)`, which calculates the length of the string `item`. The variable `item` is the second string in the list `l1`. Since `item` is a string and the initial state guarantees its existence, `x` will have a specific positive integer value based on the length of that string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is 1; `x` is equal to the length of `item`; `res` is updated based on the calculations for all characters in `item`; `j` is equal to the length of `item`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is 1; `x` is equal to the length of `item`; `res` is updated based on the calculations for all characters in `item`; `j` is equal to the length of `item.**
