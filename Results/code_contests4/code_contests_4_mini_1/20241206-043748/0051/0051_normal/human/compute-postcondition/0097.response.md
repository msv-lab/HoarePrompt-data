The value of `x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1`. The current value of `i` is 1, so we will use `zs[1]`. The initial state indicates that `x` is 0, but it will be updated to `zs[1] + 1`. The variable `us` is not directly affected by this assignment, and `ts` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `x` while other variables stay the same.

Output State: **`x` is `zs[1] + 1`, `us` remains updated at index `1` to the sum of `ts` values, `ts` remains unchanged as a list initialized with zeros of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, `i` is 1**.
