According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to 10 (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of 11). The variable `i` is currently at 2 since `item` is the second string in `l1` and the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 11. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `i` must be updated to 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` will be updated accordingly as per the loop body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2 - 1] * res`; for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be 3.**
