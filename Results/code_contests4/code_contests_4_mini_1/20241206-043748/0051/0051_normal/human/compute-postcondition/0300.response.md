Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 1; `j` will range from 0 to -1; `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[0]` and `res` if `x` is less than or equal to `i`. If `x` is at least 1, `j` is the initial value of `x`; `res` is updated based on calculations involving all elements of `item` from index 0 to `x - 1`, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[0] * res`.***
