The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than or equal to 0; `us[1]` remains unchanged; `ts` is a list of zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`; `i` is 1; and `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
