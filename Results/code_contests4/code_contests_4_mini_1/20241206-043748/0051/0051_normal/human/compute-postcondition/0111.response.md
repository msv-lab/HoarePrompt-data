Since the `while` loop is a `while True`, it will always execute indefinitely unless a break statement is encountered within the loop body. At the end of the previous iteration, we are told that we broke out of the most internal loop or if statement, which implies that the loop is currently ready to execute again.

In this case, no states need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time because it will continue to run indefinitely as specified by the `while True` condition.

State: **`x` is assigned a value greater than or equal to 1; `us[1]` remains unchanged; `ts` is a list of zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`; `i` is 1**
