The value of `sign` is assigned the value of 1, which it already had. Therefore, there are no changes to the existing values of the other variables. The output state reflects that `zero` remains an integer, `numb` remains an integer with the value of `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, `s` is assigned input, and `A` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`zero` is an integer, `numb` is an integer with the value of `zero`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, `s` is assigned input, `A` remains unchanged.**
