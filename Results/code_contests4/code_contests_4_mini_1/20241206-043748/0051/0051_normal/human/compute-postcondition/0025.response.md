The variable `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`. Since `zero` is an integer, the value of `numb` will now be equal to whatever value `zero` holds. The states of the other variables (`sign`, `A`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is either 1 or -1, `A` is updated by appending `sign * numb`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is either 1 or -1, `A` is updated by appending `sign * numb`, and `i` is increased by 1.**
