Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2 - 1] * res`; for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be 3. If `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without altering `ans`.***
