The value of `j` is assigned 0. No other variables are affected, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is now 0; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `res` is 0; `x` is greater than 0; `j` is 0.
