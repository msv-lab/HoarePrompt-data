Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`. If the length of `item` (`x`) is less than or equal to `i`, `res` is updated based on the calculations involving all characters of `item` and `mod`. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on all characters of `item` processed in the loop, and `j` is set to -1.***
