The value of `sign` is assigned -1. The previous state of `sign` can either be 1 or -1, but it is explicitly set to -1 with this code. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer, `numb` is updated according to the character in `s`, `sign` is -1, `A` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer, `numb` is updated according to the character in `s`, `sign` is -1, `A` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.**
