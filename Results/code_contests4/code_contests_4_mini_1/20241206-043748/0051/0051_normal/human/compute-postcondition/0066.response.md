According to the code, since this is a `while True` loop, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any states to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

State: **`x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `us` is updated at index `i` to `ts[x - 1]` if `x` is less than or equal to 0, `ts` remains a list initialized with zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
