Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for it to execute one more time; it can proceed as it is.

State: **`zero` is an integer, `numb` is updated based on the calculation, `sign` is either 1 or -1, `A` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.**
