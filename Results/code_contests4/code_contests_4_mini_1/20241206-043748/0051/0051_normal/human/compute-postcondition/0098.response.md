According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Therefore, no specific conditions or states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`x` is `zs[1] + 1`, `us` remains updated at index `1` to the sum of `ts` values, `ts` remains unchanged as a list initialized with zeros of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, `i` is 1**
