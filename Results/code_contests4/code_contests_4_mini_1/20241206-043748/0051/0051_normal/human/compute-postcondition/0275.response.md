Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is a positive integer greater than 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `ans` is updated based on the calculations of the previous iteration; `res` is updated to (res + 2 * int(item[j]) * pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod.**
