`numb` is assigned the value of `zero`, which is an integer. The value of `numb` is updated based on this assignment, while the other variables `sign`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer; `numb` is now equal to `zero`; `sign` is either 1 or -1; `A` includes `sign * numb` as a new element; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer; `numb` is now equal to `zero`; `sign` is either 1 or -1; `A` includes `sign * numb` as a new element; `i` is increased by 1.**
