Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings containing at least 12 strings; `item` is the 12th string in `l1` with length 1; `i` is 2; `res` is updated by the expression `(res + 2 * int(item[j]) * pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)) % mod`, where `x` is at least 4 and `j` is a valid index for `item`.**
