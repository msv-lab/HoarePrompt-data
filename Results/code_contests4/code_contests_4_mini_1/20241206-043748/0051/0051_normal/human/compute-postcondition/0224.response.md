The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is the length of `item`, which is greater than `i`. The values of `n`, `l1`, `item`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2 - 1] * res; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `res` is 0; `x` is greater than `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2 - 1] * res; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `res` is 0; `x` is greater than `i`.**
