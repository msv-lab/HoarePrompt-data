Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and returns a list `us`, where each element at index `i` in `us` represents the count of how many integers in `xs` are smaller than the integer at index `i` in `xs`. This is achieved through sorting and cumulative counting, ensuring that the counts reflect the unique integers present in `xs`. The function handles lists of varying lengths (from 1 to 100,000) and integer values between 1 and 10^9, returning the appropriate cumulative counts based on the input. **
