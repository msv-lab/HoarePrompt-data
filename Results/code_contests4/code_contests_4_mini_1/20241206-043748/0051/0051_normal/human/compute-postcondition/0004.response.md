The variable `i` is assigned the value of 0. The values of the other variables `zero`, `numb`, and `sign` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0**
