Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 12 strings, `item` is the 12th string in `l1`, `ans` is the accumulated result of calculations based on `arr` and `item`, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, and if `arr[i - 1]` is 0, we skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop.***
