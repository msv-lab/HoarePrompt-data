In this case, the variable `j` is incremented by 1, while the values of `res`, `x`, and any other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but its increment indicates that it will now hold one greater than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `int(item[j])` and `pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod); `x` is decreased by 1; `j` is increased by 1.
