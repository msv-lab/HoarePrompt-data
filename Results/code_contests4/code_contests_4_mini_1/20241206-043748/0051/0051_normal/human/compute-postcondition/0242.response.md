According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than `0`, which means `i - 1` should be at least `0`. 

Since `j` is initialized to `i - 1`, if `i` is `0`, `j` would be `-1`, and the loop would not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is at least `1` for the loop to run. 

Also, `x` is the length of `item`, and `res` is updated based on calculations involving the digits of `item`, which are not directly relevant to the loop's execution but could be necessary for the loop body.

To summarize, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **`x` is the length of item, `i` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `i - 1`, and `res` is updated based on the relevant calculations involving item up to the current j**.
