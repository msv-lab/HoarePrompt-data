In this case, the loop is a `while True`, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop body to exit it. Thus, regardless of the current state at the end of the previous iteration, the loop can and will execute again.

Since there are no specific conditions that need to be adjusted for this `while True` loop to continue, we can simply repeat the program state as it is.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `us[1]` remains unchanged; `ts` is a list of zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`; `i` is 1; the value of `ts[x - 1]` cannot be updated as `x` is less than or equal to 0.**
