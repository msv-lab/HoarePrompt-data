The variable `x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is the length of `item`, which is greater than 1. Therefore, after the execution, `x` will be one less than its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `item`, `ans`, `i`, `res`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is now 1; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `res` is 0; `x` is greater than 0.**
