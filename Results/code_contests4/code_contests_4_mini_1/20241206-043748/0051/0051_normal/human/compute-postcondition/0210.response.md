`x` is assigned the value of `len(item)`, which is the length of the second string in the list `l1`. The length of `item` will depend on the actual string it holds, but the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `l1`, `item`, and `ans`, along with the newly calculated value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2 - 1] * res; x is the length of `item`.**
