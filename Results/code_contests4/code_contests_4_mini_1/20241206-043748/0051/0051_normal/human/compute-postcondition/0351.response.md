Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 12 strings; `item` is the 12th string in `l1` with length 1. If the length of `item` is less than or equal to `i`, which is 1, then `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` to its previous value, `i` remains 1, `x` is 1, and `res` is updated based on calculations involving `int(item[0])`, `mod`, and the powers of 10. Otherwise, if `x` is the length of `item`, `j` is set to -1, `res` is updated based on the calculations involving all characters of `item`, `i` is incremented to the final value after all iterations, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` to its previous value.***
