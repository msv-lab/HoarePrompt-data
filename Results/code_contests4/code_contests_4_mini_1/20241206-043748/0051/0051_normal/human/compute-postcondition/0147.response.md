According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`, which starts from `i - 1` and decrements until it reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 9. This means that `i` must be greater than 9 for the loop to execute again.

Since `j` is currently 9, for the loop to run one more time, `j` needs to decrement to 8. Therefore, `i` must be at least 10.

State: **`res` is updated with the calculation involving `item[x - i]`; `ans` remains unchanged; `j` is 8, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be greater than 9.**
