Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it can certainly execute one more time regardless of the program state. Therefore, no modifications are needed to the state variables.

State: **If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `x` is updated by subtracting the least significant bit, `us` is updated at index `i` to `ts[x - 1]`, and `ts` remains a list initialized with zeros. The most internal loop or if statement is exited; `x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1.**
