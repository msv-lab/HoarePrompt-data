The value of `sign` is reassigned to -1. The previous value of `sign` was 1. The states of the other variables `zero`, `numb`, `i`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is -1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned input from standard input; the character at position `i` in `s` is less than the ASCII value of '0'; and the character at position `i` in `s` is equal to '-'.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is -1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned input from standard input; the character at position `i` in `s` is less than the ASCII value of '0'; and the character at position `i` in `s` is equal to '-'**.
