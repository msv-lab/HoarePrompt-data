Postcondition: ***`x` is `zs[len(xs) - 2] + 1`, and after the operation, `x` is updated to `x - (x & -x)` resulting in `x` being less than or equal to 0; `us` is updated at index `i` (where `i` is `len(xs) - 2`) to `ts[x - 1]`, and `ts` remains a list initialized with zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`.***
