The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 0, `us` is updated at index `i` to the sum of `ts` values corresponding to all indices that `x` traversed during the iterations, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
