To analyze the code snippet, we have the following:

- `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `arr[i - 1]` and `res`.
- The value of `i` is 3, so `i - 1` equals 2. This means we are accessing the third element of the list `arr`.
- The values of `arr` and `res` are not explicitly given, but they are involved in the calculation.

Since `ans` is updated with the expression `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, we need to know:
- The previous value of `ans`.
- The value of `arr[2]` (the third element of `arr`).
- The value of `res`.

However, since we don't have specific values for these variables, we can only state the relationship and the update that occurs.

Thus, the output state reflects the update to `ans` based on the formula given:

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2] * res`**
