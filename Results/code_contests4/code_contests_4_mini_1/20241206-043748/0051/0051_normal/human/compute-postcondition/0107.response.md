Output State: **`x` is a new value less than or equal to 0; `us[1]` remains unchanged; `ts` is a list of zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`; `i` is 1; `us[i]` is increased by `ts[x - 1]`, which is an invalid index access due to `x` being less than or equal to 0; therefore, the operation does not affect the variables, and `x` remains unchanged.**
