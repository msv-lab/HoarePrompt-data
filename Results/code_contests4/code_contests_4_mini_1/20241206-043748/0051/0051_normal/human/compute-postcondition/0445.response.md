Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings containing at least 12 strings; `item` is the 12th string in `l1` with length 1; `i` is 3; `x` is 1; `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration calculations; `res` is 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2] * res`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `l1`, `item`, `i`, `j`, and `x` remain unchanged, `res` is updated based on calculations involving `item[0]`, `item[1]`, and `item[2]`, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2] * res` to its previous value.***
