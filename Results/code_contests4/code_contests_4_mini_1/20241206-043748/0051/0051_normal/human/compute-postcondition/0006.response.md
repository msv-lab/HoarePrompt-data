Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least one time regardless of the state of the variables. No modifications are required for the loop to execute.

State: **`zero` is an integer; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned input from standard input.**
