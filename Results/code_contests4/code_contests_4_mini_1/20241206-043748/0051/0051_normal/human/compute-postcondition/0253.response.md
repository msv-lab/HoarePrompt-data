Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, and `x` is the length of `item`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `j` is set to -1, `res` is updated to its final calculated value after processing all digits of `item`, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` to its previous value. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on calculations involving all relevant digits of `item`, `x` remains the length of `item`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` will range from `i - 1` to -1, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`.***
