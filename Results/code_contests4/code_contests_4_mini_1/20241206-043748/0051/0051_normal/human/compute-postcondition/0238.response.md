The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The other variables (`res`, `i`, and `x`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[2]`, `i` is decreased by 1, `j` is 3, and `x` is now decreased by 1.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[2]`, `i` is decreased by 1, `j` is 3, and `x` is now decreased by 1.**
