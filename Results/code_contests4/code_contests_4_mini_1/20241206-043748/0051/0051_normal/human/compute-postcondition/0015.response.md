`numb` is assigned the value of `zero`, which remains unchanged since the value of `zero` is an integer. The states of the other variables (`sign`, `i`, `s`, `A`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer; `numb` is an integer with the value of `zero`; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned input; `A` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer; `numb` is an integer with the value of `zero`; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is assigned input; `A` remains unchanged.**
