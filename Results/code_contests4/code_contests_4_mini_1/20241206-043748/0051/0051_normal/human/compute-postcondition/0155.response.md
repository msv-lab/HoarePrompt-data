Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000); `l1` is a list of strings; `item` is the first string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; if `x` is less than or equal to 10, then `res` is updated based on `arr[9] * res` and `ans` is updated. Otherwise, `res` is updated with the calculation involving all elements from `item[0]` to `item[9]`, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[9] * res`. In both cases, `j` is set to -1 and `i` is 10.***
