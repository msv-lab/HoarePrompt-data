The value of `x` is decremented by 1, while the values of `res`, `i`, and `mod` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, `x` is decremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `mod` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, `x` is decremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `mod` remains unchanged.**
