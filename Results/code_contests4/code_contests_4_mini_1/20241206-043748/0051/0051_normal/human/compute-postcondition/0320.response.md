Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 12 strings; `item` is the 12th string in `l1` with length 1; `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` to its previous value; `i` is 1; `x` is 1; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `int(item[0])`, `mod`, and the powers of 10.**
