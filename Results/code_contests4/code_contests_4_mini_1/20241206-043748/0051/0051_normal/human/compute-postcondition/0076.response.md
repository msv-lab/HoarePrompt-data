Postcondition: ***`x` is updated by subtracting the least significant bit. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `us[i]` is updated at index `i` to `ts[x - 1]` and `x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1`. Then, `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `x` was positive, these updates do not occur, but `x` retains its value after the least significant bit subtraction.***
