The variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res` to its current value. The value of `i` is 10, so `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[9]`. The value of `res` is already determined from the calculation involving all elements from `item[0]` to `item[9]`. The variable `j` remains unchanged at -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated with the calculation involving all elements from `item[0]` to `item[9]`, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[9] * res`, `j` is -1, `i` is 10.

Output State: **`res` is updated with the calculation involving all elements from `item[0]` to `item[9]`, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[9] * res`, `j` is -1, `i` is 10**.
