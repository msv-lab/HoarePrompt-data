The value of `sign` is assigned the value -1, changing it from either 1 or -1 to -1. The values of `zero`, `numb`, and `A` remain unchanged, and `i` has already been increased by 1 before this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer, `numb` is updated based on the calculation, `sign` is -1, `A` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`zero` is an integer, `numb` is updated based on the calculation, `sign` is -1, `A` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.**
