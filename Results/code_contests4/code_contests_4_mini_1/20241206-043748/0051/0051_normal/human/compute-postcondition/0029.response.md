Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, then `numb` is updated based on the calculation, `sign` is either 1 or -1, `A` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `'-'`, then `numb` is updated according to the character in `s`, `sign` is -1, `A` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `'-'` and also not equal to `b'\r'`, then `numb` is set to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `A` is updated by appending `sign * numb`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'\r'`, no changes occur in the values of `zero`, `numb`, `sign`, `A`, or `i`.***
