Postcondition: ***`zero` is an integer. If `s[i]` equals `b'-'[0]`, then `sign` is -1 and `numb` is updated based on the calculation, while `A` remains unchanged and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, then `numb` is set to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `A` includes `1 * numb` as a new element, and `i` is increased by 1.***
