Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, where each string represents an integer. It calculates a result based on the lengths of these strings and their numerical values, using a specific modular arithmetic approach, and prints the accumulated result. The function handles strings of varying lengths and their distribution but does not explicitly validate the constraints on the values of `n` or the contents of the strings. **
