According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True`, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop. Since there are no conditions that would terminate the loop, it can certainly execute one more time without any modifications to the state.

State: **`x` is 0; the last element of `ts` is incremented by 1; `us` is updated at index `i`.**
