The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than or equal to 0; `us` remains a list of zeros with length equal to `len(xs)`; `i` is `len(xs) - 1`; `ts` is a list initialized with zeros with a length of `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
