Output State: **`x` is 0, `us` is updated at index `i` to the sum of `ts` values corresponding to all indices that `x` traversed during the iterations, `ts` remains a list initialized with zeros of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, the loop has terminated, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
