Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is now 1; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is 0; `x` is greater than 1.***
