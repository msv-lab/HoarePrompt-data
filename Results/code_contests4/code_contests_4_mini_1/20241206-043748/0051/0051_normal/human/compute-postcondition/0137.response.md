The function `count_next_smaller_elements` accepts a parameter `xs`. `xs` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, and the length of `xs` is a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns a list `us`, which contains cumulative sums derived from the list `ts` after the loop, considering that `i` is -1 and `x` is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `count_next_smaller_elements` is to accept a list of integers `xs` and return a list `us` containing cumulative sums based on certain conditions processed within the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and returns a list `us` which contains cumulative sums derived from internal calculations based on the input list.**
