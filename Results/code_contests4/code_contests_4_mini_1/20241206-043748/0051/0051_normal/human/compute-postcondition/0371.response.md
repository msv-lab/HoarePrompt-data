The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 12 strings; `item` is the 12th string in `l1` with length 1; `i` is 1; `x` is larger than 1; `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration calculations; `res` is 0; `j` is 0.
