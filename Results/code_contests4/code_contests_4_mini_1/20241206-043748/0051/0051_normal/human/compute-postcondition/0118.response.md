Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it can execute indefinitely, meaning it can execute at least one time regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no modifications are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, `us[1]` remains unchanged, `ts` is a list of zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, `i` is 1**
