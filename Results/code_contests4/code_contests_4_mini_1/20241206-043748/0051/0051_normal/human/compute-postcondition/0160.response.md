The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is now 1; `x` is the length of `item`; the value of `arr[i - 1]` is 0 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
