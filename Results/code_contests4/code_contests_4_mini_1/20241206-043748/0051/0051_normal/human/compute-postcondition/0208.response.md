The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged because no assignments or updates are made before the loop continues to the next iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2 - 1] * res`; for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
