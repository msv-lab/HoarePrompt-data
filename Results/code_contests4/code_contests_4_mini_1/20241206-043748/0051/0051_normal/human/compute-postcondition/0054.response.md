Postcondition: ***`x` is less than or equal to 0; `us` remains a list of zeros with length equal to `len(xs)`; `i` is `len(xs) - 1`; `ts` is a list initialized with zeros with a length of `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`. If `x` is greater than `len(ts)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
