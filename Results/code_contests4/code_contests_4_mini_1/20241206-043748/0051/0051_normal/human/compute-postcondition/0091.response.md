The expression `x += x & -x` modifies the value of `x`. The operation `x & -x` calculates the lowest set bit of `x`. Since `x` is initially `0`, `-x` is `0`, and therefore `x & -x` equals `0`. Consequently, the expression simplifies to `x += 0`, which means the value of `x` remains unchanged at `0`. Other variables (`ts`, `us`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is 0; the last element of `ts` is incremented by 1; `us` is updated at index `i`.**
