The value of `i` is decremented by 1, and since `i` was initially 1, after execution, `i` will be 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l1`, `item`, `ans`, `x`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is now 0; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `res` is 0; `x` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `ans` is the result of the calculations based on the contents of `arr` and `item`; `i` is now 0; `x` is the length of `item` - 1; `res` is 0; `x` is greater than 0.**
