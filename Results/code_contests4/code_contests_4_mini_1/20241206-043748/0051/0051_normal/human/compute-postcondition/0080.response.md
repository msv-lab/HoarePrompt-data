The expression `x += x & -x` updates the value of `x`. The operation `x & -x` calculates the lowest set bit of `x`. Since `x` is currently 0, the operation `0 & -0` results in 0. Therefore, `x` remains 0 after the operation. The other variables are not affected, so they retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`x` is 0, `us` is updated at index `i` to the sum of `ts` values corresponding to all indices that `x` traversed during the iterations, `ts` remains a list initialized with zeros of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, and the loop has terminated.**
