Postcondition: ***`x` is `zs[len(xs) - 2] + 1`. If `x` is updated to be less than or equal to 0, then `us` is updated at index `i` (where `i` is `len(xs) - 2`) to `ts[x - 1]`, `ts` remains a list initialized with zeros with length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
