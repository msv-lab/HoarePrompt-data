The variable `sign` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `sign` was either 1 or -1, but now it is confirmed to be 1. The other variables (`zero`, `numb`, `A`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `A` is updated by appending `sign * numb`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer, `numb` is equal to `zero`, `sign` is 1, `A` is updated by appending `sign * numb`, and `i` is increased by 1.**
