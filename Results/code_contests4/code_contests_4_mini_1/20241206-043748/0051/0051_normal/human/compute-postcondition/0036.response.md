The value of `sign` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `sign` could have been either 1 or -1, but now it is confirmed to be 1. The variable `numb` is equal to `zero`, which means `A` will include `1 * numb` as a new element. The variable `i` is increased by 1, but its previous value is not specified. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `zero` is an integer; `numb` is equal to `zero`; `sign` is 1; `A` includes `1 * numb` as a new element; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`zero` is an integer; `numb` is equal to `zero`; `sign` is 1; `A` includes `1 * numb` as a new element; `i` is increased by 1.**
