Output State: **`res` is updated based on the integer value of `item[x - 1]`, `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `j` is `i - 2`. The value of `res` is modified by adding the product of `int(item[j + (x - i)])` and `pow(10, (i - j - 1) * 2, mod)`, all taken modulo `mod`.**
