In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute unless interrupted by a break statement or an external condition. Therefore, the loop can execute at least one time without needing to adjust any states.

State: **`x` is 0, `us` is updated at index `i` to the sum of `ts` values corresponding to all indices that `x` traversed during the iterations, `ts` remains a list initialized with zeros of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`, and the loop has terminated.**
