Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state right before the loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute. 

State: **`x` is `zs[len(xs) - 2] + 1`, `us` remains a list of zeros with length equal to `len(xs)`, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`, `ts` is a list initialized with zeros with a length of `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1`**
