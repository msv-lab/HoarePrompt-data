Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `j` is `x - 2`; `res` is updated by adding `int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j) * 2 - 1, mod) and taking modulo `mod`.**
