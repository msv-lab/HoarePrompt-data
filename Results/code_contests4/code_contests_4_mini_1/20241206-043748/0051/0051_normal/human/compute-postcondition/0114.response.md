The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is now reduced by the value of the lowest set bit; `us[1]` remains unchanged; `ts` is still a list of zeros; `i` is still 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
