According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `x`, which is the length of `item`. Since `item` is the second string in `l1`, we know that `x` is at least 1 because `l1` has at least 2 strings (the first and second). The loop is set to iterate from `x - 1` down to `0`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, which is satisfied since `item` is derived from `l1` that contains at least two strings. The initial value of `j` will be `x - 1`, which is valid as `x` is at least 1.

Therefore, the necessary states for the loop to execute at least once are:
- `x` is at least 1, which is satisfied.
- `j` will start from `x - 1`.

The state can remain as is, but I will confirm the values for clarity regarding `j`:
- `j` is initialized to `x - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `item` is the second string in `l1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2 - 1] * res, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is 0, `j` is `x - 1` (which is at least 0)**
