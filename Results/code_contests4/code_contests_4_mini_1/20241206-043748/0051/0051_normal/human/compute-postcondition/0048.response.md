The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `zero`. `zero` is an integer. After executing the function body, the program processes a sequence of numbers and returns a list `A` that contains all the parsed numbers from the sequence, adjusted by their respective signs, including the last parsed number multiplied by its sign. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `zero` and return a list of adjusted integers based on a sequence of parsed numbers and their signs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter zero and returns a list A containing all parsed numbers from a sequence adjusted by their respective signs, including the last number multiplied by its sign.**
