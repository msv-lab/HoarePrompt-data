Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `item` is the second string in `l1`; `x` is the length of `item`; `i` is 1; `j` will range from 0 to -1; `ans` is updated based on the calculations of the previous iteration; if `arr[i - 1]` equals 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
