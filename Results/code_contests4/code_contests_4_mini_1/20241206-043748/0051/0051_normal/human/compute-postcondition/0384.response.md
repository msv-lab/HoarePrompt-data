Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `l1` is a list of strings with at least 12 strings; `item` is the 12th string in `l1` with length 1; `i` is 1; `x` is 1; `j` is the initial value of `x`; `res` is updated based on the calculations for all iterations using the values of `int(item[j])` and `pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)`, where `j` has incremented from 0 to the initial value of `x` - 1.**
