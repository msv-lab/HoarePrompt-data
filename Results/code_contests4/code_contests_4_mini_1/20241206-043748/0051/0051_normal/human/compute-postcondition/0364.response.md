Output State: **`res` is updated based on the computed value from `item[0]`, `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute a second time, `item` is the current item being processed, `mod` is the current modulus operation, and `j` is -1; `res` is updated to (res + int(item[-1]) * pow(10, (x - (-1) - 1) * 2, mod)) % mod.**
