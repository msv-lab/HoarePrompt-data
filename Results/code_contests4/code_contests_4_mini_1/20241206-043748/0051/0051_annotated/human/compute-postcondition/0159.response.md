Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all string lengths, `i` is 1, `j` is 11, `x` is the length of the 12th item, `res` is the final calculated result based on all iterations of `item`. Additionally, the count of strings of length `i` (which is 1) in `arr` is equal to 0.***
