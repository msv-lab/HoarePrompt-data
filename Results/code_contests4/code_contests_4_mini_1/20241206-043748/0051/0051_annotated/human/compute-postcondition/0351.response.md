Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 1; `j` is determined based on the last value of `j` within the loop; `res` is updated based on the calculations performed; if `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[0] * res`, where `x` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res` based on the previous values of `arr[i - 1]`, `res`, and `ans`, while all other variables remain unchanged.***
