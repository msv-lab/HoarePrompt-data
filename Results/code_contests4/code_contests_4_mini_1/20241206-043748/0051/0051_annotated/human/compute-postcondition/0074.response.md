The operation `x -= x & -x` modifies the value of `x`. The expression `x & -x` computes the lowest set bit of `x`, and subtracting this value from `x` effectively removes this lowest set bit. 

Since the initial value of `x` is an integer, its specific value is unknown, but we know it will change based on the operation. The value of `us[i]` remains unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer (changed to a new integer after removing the lowest set bit), `us[i]` remains updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`.
Output State: **`x` is an integer (changed to a new integer after removing the lowest set bit), `us[i]` remains updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`**
