The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The previous values of the affected variables are `ans` (unchanged), `arr`, `i`, and `res` (which is based on the last `i` characters of `item` multiplied by powers of `10` modulo `998244353`). The value of `arr[i - 1]` is taken from the `arr` list at index `i - 1`, and `res` is already defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the last `i` characters of `item` multiplied by powers of `10` modulo `998244353`, `j` is -1, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated based on `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the last `i` characters of `item` multiplied by powers of `10` modulo `998244353`, `j` is -1, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated based on `ans + arr[i - 1] * res.**
