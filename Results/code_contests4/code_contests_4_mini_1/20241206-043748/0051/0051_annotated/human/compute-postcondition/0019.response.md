Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned based on `py2`, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is `x - 48`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is valid if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`. If `s[i]` is less than `b'0'[0]`, `A` remains an empty list if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `A` contains the value of `sign * numb` (which is 0); `numb` remains zero; `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` remains 1; `i` is 0; `s` is the input from stdin; and the character at index `i` of `s` is less than `b'0'[0]` and either equal to `b'-'[0]` or not equal to `b'-'[0]` and not equal to `b'\r'[0]`.***
