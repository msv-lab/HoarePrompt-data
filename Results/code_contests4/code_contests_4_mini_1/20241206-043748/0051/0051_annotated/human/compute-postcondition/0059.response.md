Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the variable states. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1`, where `i` is `len(xs) - 2`, and `x` is now greater than or equal to `len(ts)`**
