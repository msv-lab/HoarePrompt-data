According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the state of `x`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state variables to ensure the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`x` is less than its previous value (greater than 1); `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`**
