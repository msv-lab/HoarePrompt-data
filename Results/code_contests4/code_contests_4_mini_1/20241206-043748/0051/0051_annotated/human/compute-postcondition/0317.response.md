To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line of code on the variables given the initial state.

1. The line of code updates `res` using the formula:
   ```
   res = (res + int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j - 1) * 2, mod)) % mod
   ```
   
2. From the initial state:
   - `res` is already updated to `(res + int(l1[-1]) * 1000) % 998244353`. We do not have the precise value of `res` at this moment, but we will use its updated value for further calculations.
   - `j` is 0, meaning `item[j]` refers to the first element of the list `item`.
   - `x` is at least 2, so `(x - j - 1)` will be at least 1.
   - We need to consider the value of `item` which is not explicitly given in the initial state. It is assumed to be a list or similar collection.

3. The operation involves:
   - Fetching the value at `item[0]` (since `j` is 0) and converting it to an integer.
   - Calculating `pow(10, (x - 1) * 2, mod)`, which will yield a power of 10 raised to an even number (since `x` is at least 2) and taken modulo `mod`.

4. We do not have specific values for `item[0]`, `res`, or `x`, but we can denote:
   - Let `value = int(item[0])` (the integer conversion of the first item).
   - Let `power_value = pow(10, (x - 1) * 2, mod)`.

5. The final updated value of `res` will be:
   ```
   res = (res + value * power_value) % mod
   ```

Based on this analysis, and because we have not specified the exact values of `item`, `res`, or `x`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`res` is updated by adding `int(item[0]) * pow(10, (x - 1) * 2, mod)`, where `j` is 0, `x` is at least 2, and `mod` is 998244353.**
