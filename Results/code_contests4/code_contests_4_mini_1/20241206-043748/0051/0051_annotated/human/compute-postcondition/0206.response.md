Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; if the length of the 12th item `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`, `i` is set to 1, `j` is set to -1, and `res` is updated based on the values of `int(item[0])` through `int(item[x-1])`. Otherwise, `res` is updated based on the last `i` characters of `item` multiplied by powers of `10` modulo `998244353`, `j` is set to -1, `arr`, `n`, `mod`, and `l1` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated based on `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`.***
