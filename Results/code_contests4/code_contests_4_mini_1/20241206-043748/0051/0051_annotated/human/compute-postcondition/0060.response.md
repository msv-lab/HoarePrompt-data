The value of `us[i]` is incremented by `ts[x - 1]`. The initial state indicates that `x` is equal to `zs[i] + 1`, and since it is stated that `x` is greater than or equal to `len(ts)`, it follows that `ts[x - 1]` is a valid index. The previous values of `us[i]` and `ts[x - 1]` are not specified, but we can denote that `us[i]` is being updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`**
