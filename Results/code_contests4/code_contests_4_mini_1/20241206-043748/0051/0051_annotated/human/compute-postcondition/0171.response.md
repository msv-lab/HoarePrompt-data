According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined in the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `x` is 1, which means the loop has executed for `j = 0` (the first and only iteration in this case). 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` will be decremented to -1 after the current iteration. Since -1 is less than 0, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute a second time, `x` must be increased such that `j` can be greater than or equal to 0. 

Given that `x` is currently 1 and `j` starts at `x - 1`, if `x` were at least 2, `j` would be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
