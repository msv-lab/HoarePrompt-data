The value of `x` is updated using the expression `x += x & -x`. Here, `x` is currently 0. The expression `x & -x` evaluates to 0 because `-x` (which is 0) AND `x` (which is also 0) results in 0. Therefore, `x` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`x` is 0, `us[i]` is updated by adding the sum of `ts` values corresponding to the original values of `x` during each iteration, and `zs[i]` remains unchanged.**
