The value of `x` is decreased by 1, while `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is increased by 1. The condition for the loop to execute again requires `x` to be greater than `i`. The previous values of `res` and `item[j]` are not affected by this operation, and they remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, `x` is decreased by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than `i`.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item[j]`, `x` is decreased by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than `i`.**
