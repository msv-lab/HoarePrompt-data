According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` indicates that the loop will execute as long as `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`. If `i` is `0`, the starting point of `range` would be `-1`, and the loop would not execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is already initialized to `initial j + (previous value of x - i)`. 

For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least `1`, which means that `j` would start from `0` (if `i` is `1`). 

State: **`x` is the length of `item`, `j` is `initial j + (previous value of x - i)`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is initialized accordingly**
