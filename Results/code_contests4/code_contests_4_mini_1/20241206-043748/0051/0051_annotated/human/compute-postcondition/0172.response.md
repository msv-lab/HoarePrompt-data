To evaluate the impact of the given code on the initial state, we analyze the assignment operation involving the variable `res`. 

1. The expression `int(item[j])` retrieves the value at index `j` of the list `item` and converts it to an integer. Given that `j` is 1, the value of `item[1]` is used.
2. The `pow(10, (x - j - 1) * 2, mod)` computes the power of 10 raised to the exponent `(x - j - 1) * 2` under the modulus `mod`. With `x` being 2 and `j` being 1, the exponent evaluates to `(2 - 1 - 1) * 2 = 0`. Thus, `pow(10, 0, mod)` equals 1.
3. The overall operation for `res` becomes `res = (res + int(item[1]) * 1) % mod`. So `res` is updated by adding `int(item[1])` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `mod`.

Since the exact value of `item[1]` and the previous value of `res` are not provided, we will refer to them symbolically. 

Therefore, the output state will be described in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on `int(item[1])`, `j` is 1, `x` is 2, `mod` is 998244353**
