In the provided state, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue executing indefinitely as long as there are no break statements or conditions that lead to an exit from the loop. Since there are no conditions preventing the loop from executing again, we do not need to adjust any states.

State: **`x` is 0, `us[i]` is unchanged, `zs[i]` is unchanged; `ts` is updated at index -1 by adding 1.**
