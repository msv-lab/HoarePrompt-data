The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the block we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 2; `ans` is updated based on the previous conditions and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
