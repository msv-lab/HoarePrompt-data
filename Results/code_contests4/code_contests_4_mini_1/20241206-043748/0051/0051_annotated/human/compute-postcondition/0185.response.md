Output State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `x` is greater than 0; `res` is updated to the new value based on the computation involving `int(item[j])`, `pow(10, x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1, mod)`, and the previous value of `res`.**
