The value of `sign` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous value of `sign` was `1`, so now `sign` changes from `1` to `-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input; `A` is an empty list; `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`; `sign` is -1; `i` is 0; `s` is the input from stdin; the character at index `i` of `s` is less than `b'0'[0] and the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to `b'-'[0`.
