The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than its previous value (greater than 1) and is less than or equal to 0, `us[0]` is updated to `us[0] + ts[x - 1]`, and `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
