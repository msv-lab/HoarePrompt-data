The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is less than or equal to 0, `us[i]` remains unchanged, and `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
