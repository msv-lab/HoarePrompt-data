To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(1, 11):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means that `i` takes values from 1 to 10 (inclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10.
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000.
- `mod` is 998244353.
- `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items.
- `x` is the length of the current `item`.
- `res` is initially 0.
- `i` is the final value after all iterations.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to 10, the loop will execute a total of 10 times. If the loop has completed its last iteration, `i` would be 10 at the end of the last iteration, and it cannot execute again because the range specified in the loop does not include 11.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `i` will need to be set to 11 (as the loop would naturally increment it beyond its defined range).

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` will be adjusted to 11 for the loop to hypothetically execute again, and we can conclude that the loop cannot execute again based on the current definition. However, if we are to present this in the format specified, it would be:

State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `x` is the length of the current `item`, `res` is updated based on the calculations performed, `i` is 11 for the loop to execute hypothetically again which would be out of the defined range**.
