According to the code, the `while True` loop is designed to execute indefinitely, meaning it will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Since there are no conditions that affect the execution of the loop, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`x` is greater than 1; `us[i]` remains unchanged; `i` is 0**
