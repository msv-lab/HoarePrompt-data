Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input; `A` is a list containing the value of `sign * numb` (which is 0); `numb` remains zero; `sign` is 1; `i` is 0; `s` is the input from stdin; the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to `b'-'[0]` and is also not equal to `b'\r'[0]`.***
