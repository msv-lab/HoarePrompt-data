Output State: **`x` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to the length of `ts`, `us[i]` remains unchanged, and `ts` has been updated for each valid increment of `x` during the iterations of the loop. The final value of `x` is the next positive integer greater than its initial value, with `ts[x - 1]` reflecting the number of times `x` was incremented.**
