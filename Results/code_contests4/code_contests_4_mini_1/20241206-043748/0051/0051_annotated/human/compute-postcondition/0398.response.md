Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `x` is the length of the current `item`, and `res` is initially 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`. If `x` equals the length of `item`, then `j` is equal to `i - n`, `i` is the final value after all iterations, `res` is updated based on the calculations performed during the loop for all `j` values from `i - 1` to `0`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`.***
