Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned based on `py2`, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is `x - 48`, `sign` is -1, and `i` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to `b'-'[0]`. Otherwise, `A` includes `0`, `numb` is `zero`, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, with no changes if `s[i]` equals `b'\r'[0]`.***
