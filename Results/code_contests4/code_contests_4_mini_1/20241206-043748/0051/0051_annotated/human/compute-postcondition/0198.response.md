According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i - 1` and decrements until it is no longer greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its lowest value in the loop, which is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `-1` after decrementing, meaning that it has reached the end of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would be initialized to `i - 1`, and the loop can only run again if `i` is greater than `0`. 

State: **`res` is updated based on the last character of `item` multiplied by 10 modulo 998244353, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be greater than 0 and `j` is initialized to `i - 1`.**
