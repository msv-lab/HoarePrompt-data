Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned based on `py2`, `A` is an empty list. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, `numb` is updated to `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48`, `sign` is assigned as per the conditions, and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `s[i]` equals `b'-'[0]`, `sign` is set to -1 and `numb` is updated as per the conditions, with `i` increased by 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'-'[0]`, `A` contains the element `sign * numb`, `numb` is reset to zero, `sign` is set to 1, and `i` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`. If `s[i]` equals `b'\r'[0]`, there are no changes made to `A`, `numb`, `sign`, or `i`.***
