The statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since `i` is 11, which is out of the defined range for the loop, it suggests that the loop does not execute again. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `x` is the length of the current `item`, `res` is updated based on the calculations performed, `i` is 11 and we do not continue as `i` is out of the loop's defined range.
