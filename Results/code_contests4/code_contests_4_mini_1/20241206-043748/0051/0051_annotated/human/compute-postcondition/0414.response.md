The variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. The values of `arr`, `res`, and `ans` are not specified in the initial state, but based on the context, `arr[i - 1]` will retrieve the count of strings of length `i`, while `res` contains a calculated value involving characters of `item`. The variable `j` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` has been updated based on the multiplication of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`**
