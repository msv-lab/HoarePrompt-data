In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means that it will always execute again regardless of the program state. There are no conditions that need to be checked or adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`xs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(xs) - 1`, `x` is updated to 0 if it was greater than `len(ts)`, and `ts[x - 1]` is incremented by 1**
