According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `x` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2 (for instance, `x` could be 3 or more).

State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `res` is updated based on `arr[i - 1]` and `res`; and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 2**.
