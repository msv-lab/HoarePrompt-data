The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `j` was determined based on the last value of `j` within the loop, but since this assignment resets `j` to `0`, it overrides whatever value it held before. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `res` is 0, `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all string lengths, and `x` is now decremented by 1.
