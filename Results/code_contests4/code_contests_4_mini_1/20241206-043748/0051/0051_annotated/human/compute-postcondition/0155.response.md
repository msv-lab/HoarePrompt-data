Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings, `i` is 11, and `res` is 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[10] * res` to it. Otherwise, `x` is the length of the current item, `j` is set to -1, `i` is updated to the length of the item plus 1, and `ans` is updated based on `arr[len(item)] * res`.***
