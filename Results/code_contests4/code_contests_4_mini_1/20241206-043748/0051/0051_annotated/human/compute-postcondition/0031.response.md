Since the loop statement is `while True`, it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, no changes need to be made to the program state for the loop to proceed.

State: **`conv` is assigned based on `py2`, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is updated as per the conditions, `sign` is assigned as per the conditions, and `i` is increased by 1**
