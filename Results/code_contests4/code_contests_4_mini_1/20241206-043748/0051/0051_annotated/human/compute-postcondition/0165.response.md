According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `x`, which is the length of the 12th item in the list `l1`. For the loop to execute, `x - 1` must be at least 0, meaning `x` must be at least 1. However, it is given that `x` is less than or equal to 1. This means that if `x` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and if `x` is 1, the loop will execute exactly once. 

Since `x` is stated to be less than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `x` is exactly 1 for the loop to execute. In this case, `j` will start at 0 and will take the value of 0 during the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments are needed: `x` must be exactly 1, and during the first execution, `j` is 0.

State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x` is 1, `res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be 1.**
