Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 3; if the length of `item` (`x`) is less than or equal to 3, `res` is updated based on calculations involving all characters of `item`, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2] * res`, `res` is updated based on calculations involving `item[0]`, `item[1]`, and `item[2]`.***
