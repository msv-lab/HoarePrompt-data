The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is `x`, so after execution, `i` becomes `x + 1`. The states of the other variables (`j` and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `i`, `j` is incremented by (initial `x` - `i`), `res` is updated based on the cumulative calculations from the loop, and `i` is now `x + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is `i`, `j` is incremented by (initial `x` - `i`), `res` is updated based on the cumulative calculations from the loop, and `i` is now `x + 1`**.
