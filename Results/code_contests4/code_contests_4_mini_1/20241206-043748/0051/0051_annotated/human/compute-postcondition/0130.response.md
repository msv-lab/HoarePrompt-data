The expression `x += x & -x` updates the value of `x`. Since `x` is currently 0, we first evaluate `x & -x`. The value of `-x` is 0 (as -0 is still 0), so `x & -x` results in `0 & 0`, which is 0. Consequently, `x` remains unchanged after this operation.

The states of the other variables (`us[i]`, `zs[i]`, and `ts`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `us[i]` is unchanged, `zs[i]` is unchanged; `ts` is updated at index -1 by adding 1.**
