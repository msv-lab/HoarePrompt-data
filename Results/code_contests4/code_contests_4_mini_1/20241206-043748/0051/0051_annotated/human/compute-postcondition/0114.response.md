The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the block of code we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; `x` is updated to `x - (x & -x)` and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.
