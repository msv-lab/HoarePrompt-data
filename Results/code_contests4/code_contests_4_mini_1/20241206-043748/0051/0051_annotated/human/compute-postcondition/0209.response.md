Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 2; if `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement while `ans` is updated based on the previous conditions.***
