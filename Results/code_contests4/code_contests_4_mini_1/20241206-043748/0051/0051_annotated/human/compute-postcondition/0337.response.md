Output State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 0; `j` is the value of `j` incremented by the total number of iterations (which is equal to `x` initially); `res` is updated based on all calculations performed during the executions of the loop; `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all string lengths; `x` is equal to `i` after the loop concludes (which means `x` is no longer greater than `i`).**
