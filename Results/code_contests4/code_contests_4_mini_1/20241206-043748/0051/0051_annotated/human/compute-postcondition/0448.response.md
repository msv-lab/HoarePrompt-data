The code `print(ans)` outputs the current value of `ans`, but it does not modify any variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings; `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all string lengths; `i` is 11; `j` is the index of the last character processed from the last item; `x` is the length of the last item processed in `l1`; `res` is the final calculated result based on all iterations of `item`; the value of `ans` is printed.**
