The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer (changed to a new integer after removing the lowest set bit), `us[i]` remains updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
