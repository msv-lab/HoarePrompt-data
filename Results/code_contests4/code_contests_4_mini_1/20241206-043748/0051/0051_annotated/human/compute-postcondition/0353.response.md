The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables directly. It simply causes the current iteration of the loop to end and moves to the next iteration where `i` will be incremented to 3. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop will continue with the next value of `i` and that the current values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 3; `j` is determined based on the last value of `j` within the loop; `res` is updated based on the calculations performed; `ans` remains unchanged.**
