Output State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 2; `x` is the length of `item` and must be at least 1; `res` is updated based on the formula `(0 + int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j - 1) * 2, 998244353)) % 998244353` becomes `(res + int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j) * 2 - 1, mod)) % mod`.**
