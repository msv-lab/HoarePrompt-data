According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state of `x` or any other variable. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to allow the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, and `us[i]` remains unchanged**
