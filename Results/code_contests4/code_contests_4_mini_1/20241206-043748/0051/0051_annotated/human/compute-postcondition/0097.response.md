`x` is assigned the value `zs[i] + 1`. The value of `i` is 0 for the loop to execute one more time, so `zs[0]` is used in the calculation. Since `x` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to the length of `ts`, `zs[0]` must be a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `x` will be a positive integer greater than 1. The states of `us[i]` and other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1; `us[i]` remains unchanged; `i` is 0.**
