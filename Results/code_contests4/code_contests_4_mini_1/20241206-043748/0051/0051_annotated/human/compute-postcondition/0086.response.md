The expression `x += x & -x` modifies `x` by adding the result of the bitwise operation `x & -x` to it. The value of `x` is less than or equal to 0, and since `x` is non-positive, the result of `x & -x` will also be 0 or negative.

1. Since `x` is less than or equal to 0, `-x` will be 0 or positive.
2. The bitwise AND operation `x & -x` will yield 0 when `x` is 0, and it will yield a negative value when `x` is negative.
3. Therefore, `x + (x & -x)` will either remain unchanged (if `x` is 0) or will result in a value that is still less than or equal to 0 (if `x` is negative).

Since the value of `us[i]` remains unchanged, the only variable affected is `x`.

Output State: **`x` is still less than or equal to 0; `us[i]` remains unchanged.**
