Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `x` is the length of the current `item`, `res` is updated based on the calculations performed, and since `i` is 11, which is out of the defined range, the program does not continue. If `arr[i - 1]` is 0, the function does not proceed further in the loop as `i` exceeds the valid index.***
