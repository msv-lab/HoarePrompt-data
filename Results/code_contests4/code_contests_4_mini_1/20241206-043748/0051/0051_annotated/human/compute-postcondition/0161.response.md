Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all string lengths, `i` is 1, `j` is 11, `x` is the length of the 12th item, and if `arr[i - 1]` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without any updates to `ans` or `res`.***
