The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` has increased by 1 while the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is `i`, `j` is `initial j + (previous value of x - i)`, `res` is updated based on the sum of the contributions from all relevant items in `l1` as per the formula; `i` is increased by 1.**
