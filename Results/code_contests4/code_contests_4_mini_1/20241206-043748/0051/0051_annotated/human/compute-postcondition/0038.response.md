Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned based on `py2`, `A` is an empty list. If `s[i]` equals `b'-'[0]`, `sign` is set to -1, `numb` is updated as per the conditions, and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `A` contains the element `sign * numb`, `numb` is reset to zero, `sign` is set to 1, and `i` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`. If `s[i]` equals `b'\r'[0]`, there are no changes made to `A`, `numb`, `sign`, or `i`.***
