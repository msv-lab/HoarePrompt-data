The statement `us[i] += ts[x - 1]` updates the value of `us[i]` by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its current value. The variable `x` is less than its previous value and is updated to `zs[i] + 1`, but the specific value of `x` after the update is not provided. Since `x` is greater than 1, `x - 1` is guaranteed to be at least 1, which means `ts[x - 1]` will be accessed.

The output state will reflect that `us[i]` has been modified based on the current value of `x`, which is derived from `zs[i] + 1`, but without specific values for `us[i]`, `ts`, or `zs`, we can only describe the impact in general terms.

Output State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1` (where `x` is less than its previous value and greater than 1).**
