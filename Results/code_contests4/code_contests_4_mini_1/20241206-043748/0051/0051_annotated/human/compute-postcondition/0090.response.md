Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states. 

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0; `us[i]` remains unchanged; since `x` is not greater than the length of `ts`, `ts[x - 1]` is increased by 1.**
