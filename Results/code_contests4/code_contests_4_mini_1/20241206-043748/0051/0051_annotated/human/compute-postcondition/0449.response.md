The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100,000, and that each element `a_i` is a positive integer, with values ranging from 1 to 10^9 for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, it is unclear what the function returns.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The output of the function is unspecified based on the given constraints.**
