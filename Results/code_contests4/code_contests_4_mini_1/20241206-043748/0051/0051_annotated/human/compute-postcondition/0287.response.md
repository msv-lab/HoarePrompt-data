`i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 3; `j` is `x - 2`; `res` is updated based on the calculation involving all relevant `int(item[j])` values; `x` is equal to 3.
