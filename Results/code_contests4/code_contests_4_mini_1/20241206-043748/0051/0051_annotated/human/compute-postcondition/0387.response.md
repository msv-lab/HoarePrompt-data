According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than `0`, which means `i - 1` should be at least `0`. 

Given that `i` is increased by 1 before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be at least 1, making `j` start at `i - 1`, which would be `0` in this case. 

State: **`x` is equal to the length of `item`, `j` is equal to the length of the substring processed, `res` is updated based on previous calculations, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is initialized to `i - 1` (which is at least 0)**
