Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 2; `x` is the length of `item`; and `res` is 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[1] * res`. Otherwise, `x` is equal to the length of `item`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is set to -1, `res` is updated based on the accumulated results from the loop, `mod` stays unchanged, and `ans` is updated based on `arr[i - 1]` and `res.***
