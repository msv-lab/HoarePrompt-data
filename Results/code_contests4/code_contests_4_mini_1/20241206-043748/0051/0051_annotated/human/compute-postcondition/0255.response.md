The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 3, and the loop condition requires `i` to be less than or equal to 10 for it to execute again, the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration. The values of the variables `arr`, `n`, `mod`, `l1`, `x`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000; `mod` is 998244353; `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items; `i` is 3; `x` is the length of `item`; `res` is updated based on the accumulated results from the loop; `ans` is updated based on `arr[i - 1]` and `res; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
