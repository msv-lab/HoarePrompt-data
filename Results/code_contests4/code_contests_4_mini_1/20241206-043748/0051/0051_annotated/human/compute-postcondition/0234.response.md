The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but since it's being incremented, it will now be one greater than its previous value. The values of `res`, `x`, `i`, and `mod` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the formula using `item[j]`, `x` is decremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, and `mod` remains unchanged; `j` is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the formula using `item[j]`, `x` is decremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `mod` remains unchanged; `j` is now increased by 1.**
