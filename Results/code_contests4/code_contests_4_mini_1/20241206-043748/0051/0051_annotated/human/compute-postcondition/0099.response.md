The variable `us[i]` is updated by adding the value `ts[x - 1]` to it. Since `i` is 0, this means `us[0]` will be modified. The state of `x` is greater than 1, so `x - 1` is at least 1, and thus `ts[x - 1]` is defined and will be added to `us[0]`. The previous value of `us[i]` remains unchanged in this context but is now updated based on the addition.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1; `us[i]` is updated to `us[0] + ts[x - 1]`; `i` is 0**
