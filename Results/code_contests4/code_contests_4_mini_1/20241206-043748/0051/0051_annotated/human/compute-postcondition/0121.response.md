The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 0, `us[i]` is updated by adding the sum of `ts` values corresponding to the original values of `x` during each iteration, `zs[i]` remains unchanged, and `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
