Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned the value of `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its input; `A` is an empty list if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `A` is a list containing the value of `sign * numb` (which is 0); `numb` remains zero; `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` remains 1; `i` is 0; `s` is the input from stdin; the character at index `i` of `s` is less than `b'0'[0] and either equal to `b'-'[0]` or not equal to `b'-'[0]` and not equal to `b'\r'[0]`.***
