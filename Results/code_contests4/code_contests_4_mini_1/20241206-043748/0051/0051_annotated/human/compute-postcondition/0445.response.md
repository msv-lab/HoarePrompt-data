Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `x` is the length of `item`, and `res` is initially 0. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res`. Otherwise, `j` is adjusted by subtracting `(x - i)`, and `res` is updated based on the contributions from all relevant items in `l1` according to the specified formula for all iterations, after which `ans` is also updated by adding `arr[i - 1] * res` to its previous value.***
