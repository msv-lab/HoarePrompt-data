The function `count_next_smaller_elements` accepts a parameter `xs`. `xs` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to 10^9, and the length of `xs` is between 1 and 100,000. After executing the function body, it returns the cumulative counts stored in 'us', which are derived from the frequencies in 'ts' for each index of `xs`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `count_next_smaller_elements` is to accept a list of integers `xs` and return cumulative counts based on the frequencies of smaller elements for each index in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `xs` and returns cumulative counts derived from the frequencies of smaller elements for each index in the list.**
