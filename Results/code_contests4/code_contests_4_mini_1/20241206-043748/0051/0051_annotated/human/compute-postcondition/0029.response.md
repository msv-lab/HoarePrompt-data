Postcondition: ***`conv` is assigned based on `py2`, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is updated to 10 * (x - 48) + conv(s[i]) - 48 if `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, then `numb` remains as `x - 48`, `sign` is assigned -1, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `b'-'[0]` and not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, then `A` includes 0, `numb` is set to zero, `sign` is 1, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` equals `b'\r'[0]`, there are no changes to the variables.***
