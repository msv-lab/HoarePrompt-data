The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `zero`. `zero` is an integer. The function assumes the existence of an array consisting of `n` integers `a_i`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. After executing the function body, it returns the accumulated values in `A` derived from the input `s`, which includes `0`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `zero` and return the accumulated values in `A` derived from the input array `s`, which includes `0`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `zero` and returns the accumulated values in `A` derived from the input array `s`, which includes `0`.**
