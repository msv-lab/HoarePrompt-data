The value of `x` is updated by subtracting the least significant bit of `x` (which is given by `x & -x`). Since `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1` and is less than its previous value and greater than 1, the operation will reduce `x` by a positive value, resulting in a new value for `x`. The values of `us[i]` and `ts[x - 1]` remain unchanged in this step.

Output State: **`us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]` to its previous value; `x` is updated to a new value that is less than its previous value and greater than 1 after performing `x -= x & -x`.**
