Since the while loop condition is `True`, the loop will execute indefinitely without any conditions to stop it. Therefore, the current state is sufficient for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`x` is 0, `us[i]` is updated by adding the sum of `ts` values corresponding to the original values of `x` during each iteration, and `zs[i]` remains unchanged.**
