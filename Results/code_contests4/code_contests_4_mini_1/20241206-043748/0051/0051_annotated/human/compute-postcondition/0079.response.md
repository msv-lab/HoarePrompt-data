Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely as long as the program is running. Therefore, no changes are needed to the program state for the loop to proceed with its first iteration.

State: **`x` is less than or equal to 0, `us[i]` contains the cumulative sum of `ts` values indexed by the decreasing values of `x`, starting from `zs[i] + 1` down to the last positive integer before `x` became less than or equal to 0, and `us[i]` has been updated accordingly.**
