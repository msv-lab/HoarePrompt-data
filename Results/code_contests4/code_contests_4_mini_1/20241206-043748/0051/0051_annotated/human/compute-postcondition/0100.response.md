The operation `x -= x & -x` modifies the value of `x`. The expression `x & -x` computes the lowest set bit of `x`. Since `x` is greater than 1, we can determine that the result will be a positive integer that is the lowest power of 2 that divides `x`. 

Let's denote `l` as the value of `x & -x`, and therefore the new value of `x` will be `x - l`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.

Thus, the Output State reflects the updated value of `x` and the unchanged value of `i`. 

Output State: **`x` is less than its previous value (greater than 1), `us[i]` is updated to `us[0] + ts[x - 1]`, `i` is 0**
