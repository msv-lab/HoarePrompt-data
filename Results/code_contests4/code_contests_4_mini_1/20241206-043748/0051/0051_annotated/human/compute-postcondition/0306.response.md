Postcondition: ***`arr` contains counts of strings of lengths from 1 to 10, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `mod` is 998244353, `l1` is a non-empty list of strings with at least 12 items, `i` is 1, `j` is determined based on the last value of `j` within the loop, `x` is the length of the 12th item, `res` is the final calculated result based on the last iteration's calculations, and `ans` is updated to the final accumulated result based on the calculations performed for all string lengths. If the count of strings of length corresponding to `i` (i.e., `arr[i - 1]`) is equal to 0, the program will proceed to handle this case accordingly.***
