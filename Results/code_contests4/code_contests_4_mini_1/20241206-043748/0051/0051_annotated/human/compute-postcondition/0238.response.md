The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables `res`, `x`, `i`, and `mod` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the formula involving `item[j]`; `x` is decremented by 1; `i` remains unchanged; `mod` remains unchanged; and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`res` is updated based on the formula involving `item[j]`; `x` is decremented by 1; `i` remains unchanged; `mod` remains unchanged; `j` is increased by 1.**
