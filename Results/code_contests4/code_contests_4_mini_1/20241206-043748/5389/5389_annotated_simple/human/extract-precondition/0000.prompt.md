You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vasya often uses public transport. The transport in the city is of two types: trolleys and buses. The city has n buses and m trolleys, the buses are numbered by integers from 1 to n, the trolleys are numbered by integers from 1 to m.

Public transport is not free. There are 4 types of tickets: 

  1. A ticket for one ride on some bus or trolley. It costs c1 burles; 
  2. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on some bus or on some trolley. It costs c2 burles; 
  3. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses or all trolleys. It costs c3 burles; 
  4. A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses and trolleys. It costs c4 burles. 



Vasya knows for sure the number of rides he is going to make and the transport he is going to use. He asked you for help to find the minimum sum of burles he will have to spend on the tickets.

Input

The first line contains four integers c1, c2, c3, c4 (1 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4 ≤ 1000) — the costs of the tickets.

The second line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of buses and trolleys Vasya is going to use.

The third line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) — the number of times Vasya is going to use the bus number i.

The fourth line contains m integers bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ 1000) — the number of times Vasya is going to use the trolley number i.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum sum of burles Vasya will have to spend on the tickets.

Note

In the first sample the profitable strategy is to buy two tickets of the first type (for the first bus), one ticket of the second type (for the second bus) and one ticket of the third type (for all trolleys). It totals to (2·1) + 3 + 7 = 12 burles.

In the second sample the profitable strategy is to buy one ticket of the fourth type.

In the third sample the profitable strategy is to buy two tickets of the third type: for all buses and for all trolleys.
