After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `trolsum` will contain the total of `min(x * c1, c2)` for each element `x` in the `trol` list. If `trol` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `trolsum` will remain 0. The `bussum` will still be equal to the sum of `min(x * c1, c2)` for all elements `x` in `bus`, unchanged by the loop.

Output State: **`bussum` is equal to the sum of min(x * c1, c2) for all elements x in `bus`; `trolsum` is equal to the sum of min(x * c1, c2) for all elements x in `trol`.**
