The values of `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input, while `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values assigned to `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values from input; `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from input.**
