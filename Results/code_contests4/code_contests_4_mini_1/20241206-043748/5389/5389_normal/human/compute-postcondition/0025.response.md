Functionality: ** The function reads input values for four integers (c1, c2, c3, c4), two integers (n, m), and two lists of integers (bus and trol). It calculates the total bus cost as the sum of the minimum of each bus value multiplied by c1 and c2, and similarly for the trol values. It then computes the result as the minimum of the bus cost, c3, and adds the minimum of the trol cost and c3, finally bounding the result by c4. The result is printed, representing the maximum possible cost constrained by the defined limits. **
