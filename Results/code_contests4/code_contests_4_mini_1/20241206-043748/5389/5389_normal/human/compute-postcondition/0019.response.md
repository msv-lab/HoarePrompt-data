Output State: **`bussum` is equal to the sum of the minimum of each element in `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`; `trolsum` is updated by adding min(x * c1, c2); for the loop to execute a second time `trol` must have more than 1 element; `x` is the second element in the list; `trolsum` has been incremented by min(x * c1, c2).**
