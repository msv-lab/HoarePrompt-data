The variable `res` is assigned the minimum of its current value and `c4`. The previous value of `res` is the sum of `min(bussum, c3)` and `min(trolsum, c3)`, but the specific values of `bussum`, `trolsum`, `c3`, and `c4` are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` has been updated based on its previous value and `c4`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `c4`**
