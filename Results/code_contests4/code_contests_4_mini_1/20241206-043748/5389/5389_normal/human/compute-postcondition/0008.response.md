The variable `bussum` is updated by adding the minimum of `x * c1` and `c2`. The initial state mentions that `x` is the first integer from the `bus` list, and `c1` and `c2` are values assigned from input. The value of `bussum` starts at 0.

1. Calculate `x * c1`.
2. Compare `x * c1` with `c2` to determine the minimum.
3. Add this minimum value to `bussum`.

Since `bussum` starts at 0, the new value of `bussum` will be the minimum of `x * c1` and `c2`.

Output State: **`bussum` is updated to the minimum of `x * c1` and `c2`**
