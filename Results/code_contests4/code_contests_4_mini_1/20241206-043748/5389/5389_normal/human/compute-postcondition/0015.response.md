The variable `trolsum` is incremented by the minimum of `x * c1` and `c2`. Since `x` is the first element in `trol`, the value of `x` is defined. The previous value of `trolsum` is not specified, but it will be updated based on the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `bussum` remains unchanged, `trolsum` is updated by adding the minimum of `x * c1` and `c2`.

Output State: **`bussum` is equal to the sum of the minimum of each element in `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `trolsum` is updated by adding min(x * c1, c2)**.
