The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on the pre-defined constraints where `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers in the range [1, 1000], `n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 1000], `ai` is a list of `n` integers (each in the range [0, 1000]), and `bi` is a list of `m` integers (each in the range [0, 1000]). 

The functionality of the function is determined by certain conditions based on these inputs. However, the specific output conditions or return values are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, without additional output conditions specified, we cannot detail the return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates based on pre-defined integer and list constraints. The specific return value or output conditions are not defined in the prompt.**
