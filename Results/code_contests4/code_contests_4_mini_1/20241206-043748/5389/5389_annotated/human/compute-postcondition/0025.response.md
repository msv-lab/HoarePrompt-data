Functionality: ** The function calculates the total cost of bus and trolley rides based on given constraints, where the cost for each ride is capped by a maximum value. It takes inputs for costs, limits, and the number of rides for buses and trolleys, computes the total costs for each, and prints the minimum of these totals, further constrained by additional limits. The function does not return a value but directly prints the result. **
