The variable `res` is being printed, and it was previously assigned the value of `min(bussum, c3) + min(trolsum, c3)`. The value of `res` is not changed by the print statement itself, but it reflects the state of `res` before any further modifications. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is equal to min(bussum, c3) + min(trolsum, c3).

Output State: **`res` is equal to min(bussum, c3) + min(trolsum, c3)**
