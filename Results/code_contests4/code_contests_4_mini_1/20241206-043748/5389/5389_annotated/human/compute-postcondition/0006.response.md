The variable `trolsum` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is initialized. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values from input; `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from a space-separated input; `bus` is assigned a list of integers from space-separated input; `trol` is assigned a list of integers from space-separated input; `busc1` is an empty list; `bussum` is 0; `trolsum` is 0.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values from input; `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from a space-separated input; `bus` is assigned a list of integers from space-separated input; `trol` is assigned a list of integers from space-separated input; `busc1` is an empty list; `bussum` is 0; `trolsum` is 0.**
