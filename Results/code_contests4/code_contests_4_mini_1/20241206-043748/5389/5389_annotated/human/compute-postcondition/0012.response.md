The value of `bussum` is updated by adding the minimum of `x * c1` and `c2` to it. The variable `x` has been updated to `next_x`, and since `bus` must have at least one more element, we can assume that `x` has a valid value (which is `next_x`). The previous value of `bussum` is not specified, so we will only note the change made to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `bussum` is updated to `bussum + min(x * c1, c2)`; `x` is updated to `next_x`.

Output State: **`bussum` is updated to `bussum + min(x * c1, c2)`; `x` is updated to `next_x`**.
