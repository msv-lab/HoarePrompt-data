The function accepts two positive integers `N` and `H`, followed by `N` pairs of integers representing the damage values for wielding and throwing katanas. It calculates the number of times the throwing damage can be applied to reach or exceed the health `H`, using the maximum wielding damage when the throwing damages are insufficient. The output is the total number of attacks required to reach at least `H`. If the throwing damages are all less than the maximum wielding damage, the function estimates the additional attacks needed based on the maximum wielding damage.
