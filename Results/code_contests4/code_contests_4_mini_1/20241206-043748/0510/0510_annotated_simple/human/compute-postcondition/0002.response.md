The code creates an empty list `B`. The initial values of `N`, `H`, and `A` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `H` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `H` ≤ 10^9; `A` is an empty list; `B` is an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `H` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `H` ≤ 10^9; `A` is an empty list; `B` is an empty list.**
