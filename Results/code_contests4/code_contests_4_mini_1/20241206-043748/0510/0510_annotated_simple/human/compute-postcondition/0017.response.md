Since `B` is sorted in place, the elements in `B` will be rearranged in ascending order, but the maximum value `am` from list `A` and the previous state of `N` and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the sorted list `B`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from input; `B` is sorted; `am` is the maximum value from list `A.**
