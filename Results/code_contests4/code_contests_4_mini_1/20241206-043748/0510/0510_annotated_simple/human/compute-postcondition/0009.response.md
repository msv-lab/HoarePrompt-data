`A` is a list that is being appended with the value of `a`. The previous values of `N`, `i`, and `b` are not directly affected, but `A` will now contain the value of `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 1; `b` is an integer from input; `A` now contains `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 1; `b` is an integer from input; `A` now contains `a**
