The code `B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. However, since the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `b` or the list `B`, we cannot determine the specific changes to those variables. The values of `N`, `i`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 2; `A` is a list containing the input integer `a`; and `B` is modified by appending the value of `b`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 2; `A` is a list containing the input integer `a`; `B` is modified by appending the value of `b`.**
