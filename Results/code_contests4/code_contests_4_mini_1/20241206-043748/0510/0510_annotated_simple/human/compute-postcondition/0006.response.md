`B` is a list that will have the value of `b` appended to it. The variables `N`, `i`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged, while `B` now includes the value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 0; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` has `a` appended to it; `B` has `b` appended to it.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 0; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `A` has `a` appended to it; `B` has `b` appended to it.**
