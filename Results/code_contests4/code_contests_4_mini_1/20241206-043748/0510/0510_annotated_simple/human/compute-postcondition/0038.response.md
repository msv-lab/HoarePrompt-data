The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is sorted in reverse order and contains an additional element -1; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`; `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`; `h` is increased by `b`; variable `c` is increased by 1.
