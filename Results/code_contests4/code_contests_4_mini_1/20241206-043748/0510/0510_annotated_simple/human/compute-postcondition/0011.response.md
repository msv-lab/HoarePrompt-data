According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
