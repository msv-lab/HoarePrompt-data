According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, `N` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
