The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is sorted in reverse order and contains an additional element -1; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`; `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`; `h` is less than `H`; `c` is increased by the value of int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am)) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
