According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, the loop can execute as long as `N` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will take values starting from 0 up to `N-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `N` must be at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
