Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is sorted in reverse order and contains an additional element -1; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`. If `b` is less than `am`, then `h` is updated to `0`, `c` is incremented by the result of `ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am)`, and `bi` is set to `0`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `am`, then `h` is updated to `b`, `c` is set to `1`, and `bi` is set to `1`.***
