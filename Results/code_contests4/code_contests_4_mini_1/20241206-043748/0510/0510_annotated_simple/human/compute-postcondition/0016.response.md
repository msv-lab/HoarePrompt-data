`am` is assigned the maximum value from the list `A`. The value of `A` contains `N` integers, and since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, the maximum value will be one of those integers in the list. The states of the other variables (`N` and `B`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from input; `B` is a list containing `N` integers from input; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from input; `B` is a list containing `N` integers from input; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`.**
