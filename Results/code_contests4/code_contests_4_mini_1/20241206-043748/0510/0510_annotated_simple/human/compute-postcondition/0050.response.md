Output State: **`h` is less than or equal to `H`, `c` is incremented by the number of times elements from `B` were processed; if any element `b` from `B` was less than `am`, then `c` is incremented by `ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am)`; `bi` is the index of the last processed element in `B`. The value of `c` is printed.**
