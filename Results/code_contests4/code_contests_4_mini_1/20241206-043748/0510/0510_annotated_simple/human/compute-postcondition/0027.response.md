The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from input; `B` is sorted in reverse order and contains an additional element -1; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is the previous value of `c` incremented by the result of `ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am)`; `bi` is 0; `b` is the first element of `B`, and `b` is less than `am` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
