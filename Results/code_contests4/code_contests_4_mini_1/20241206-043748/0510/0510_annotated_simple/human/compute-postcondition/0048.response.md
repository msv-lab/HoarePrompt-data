Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is sorted in reverse order and contains an additional element -1; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`; `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`; `h` is less than `H`. If `b` is less than `am`, then `c` is increased by the value of int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am)) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `h` is increased by `b`, `c` is increased by 1, and `bi` is increased by 1.***
