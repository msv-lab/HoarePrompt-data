`B` is a list that is having the integer `b` appended to it. The previous values of `N`, `i`, and `A` are not directly affected, but the state of `B` will change to include the new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 1; `b` is an integer from input; `A` now contains `a`; `B` now contains its previous elements plus the new integer `b`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 1; `b` is an integer from input; `A` now contains `a`; `B` now contains its previous elements plus the new integer `b.**
