According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and the variable `H`. For the loop to execute, `h` must be less than `H`. Right before the loop, `h` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `H` must be greater than 0. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `h` is already 0, which is less than `H` if `H` is greater than 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from input; `B` is sorted in reverse order and contains an additional element -1; `am` is the maximum value from list `A`; h is 0; c is 0; bi is 0; for the loop to execute the first time `H` must be greater than 0**
