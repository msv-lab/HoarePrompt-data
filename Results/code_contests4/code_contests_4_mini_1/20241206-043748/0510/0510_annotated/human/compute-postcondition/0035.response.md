To evaluate the impact of the given code snippet, we first need to analyze the variables:

- `H` and `h` are not provided in the initial state, but they are involved in the calculation.
- `am` is the maximum value in `A`.
- The expression `(H - h) * 1.0 / am` will be computed, and its ceiling will be taken before it is added to `c`.

Now, let's summarize the impact of the code:

1. The expression `(H - h) * 1.0 / am` calculates the difference between `H` and `h`, multiplies it by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division, and then divides it by `am`.
2. The ceiling of the result is taken using `ceil()`, which rounds up to the nearest integer.
3. The resulting integer is added to `c`.

Since we don't have specific values for `H`, `h`, or `c`, the output state will reflect the general operation performed.

Output State: **`c` is incremented by the ceiling of ((H - h) / am), where `am` is the maximum value in `A`.**
