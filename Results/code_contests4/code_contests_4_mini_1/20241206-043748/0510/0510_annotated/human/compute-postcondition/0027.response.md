The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is updated by `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`; `bi` is 0; `b` is the first element of `B` which is less than `am` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
