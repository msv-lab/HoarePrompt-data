The variable `A` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `N`, `H`, `a_i`, or `b_i` as they are not manipulated in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current status of the variables without any changes to `N`, `H`, `a_i`, or `b_i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `H` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `H` ≤ 10^9; `A` is an empty list.**
