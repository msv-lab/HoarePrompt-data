The code `B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. The previous states of variables do not affect this operation directly, but the list `B` will now include the new value `b`. The values of `N`, `i`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1; `A` has a new value with `a` appended to it; `B` now includes the value `b`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1; `A` has a new value with `a` appended to it; `B` now includes the value `b.**
