`am` is assigned the value of `max(A)`, which means `am` will hold the maximum value from the list `A`. The value of `N` determines how many values are in `A`, and since `N` is between 1 and 100,000, `A` contains valid integers. The values of `B` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` contains `N` values of `b`; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` contains `N` values of `b`; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A**.
