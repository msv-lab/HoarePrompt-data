Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, N and H, which represent the number of pairs and a threshold, respectively. It then reads N pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) from input, where each a_i and b_i is constrained as specified. The function calculates the maximum value of a_i and sorts the corresponding b_i values in descending order. It iteratively sums the b_i values until the cumulative sum reaches or exceeds H. If a b_i value is found to be less than the maximum a_i, the function calculates how many additional uses of the maximum a_i would be required to reach or exceed H and adds this count to the total. Finally, it prints the total count of operations performed, which could be a combination of using b_i values and additional uses of the maximum a_i. The function does not handle potential input errors or cases where N is 0 or invalid, nor does it return any value but prints the result directly.**
