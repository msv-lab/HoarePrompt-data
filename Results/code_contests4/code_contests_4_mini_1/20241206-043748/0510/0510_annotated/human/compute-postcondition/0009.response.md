`A` is a list that is being appended with the value of `a`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are taken from input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Since `A` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. The output state reflects that `a` has been added to `A`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1; `A` has a new value with `a` appended to it.**
