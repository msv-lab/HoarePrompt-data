The code `B.append(-1)` adds the value `-1` to the list `B`. This operation does not affect the values of `N`, `A`, `i`, or `am`, but it modifies `B` by appending `-1` at the end of the list. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and now contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A.**
