According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `h` is less than `H`. Right before the loop, `h` is 0. For the loop to execute, `H` must be defined and greater than `h`. Since `h` is currently 0, `H` must be greater than 0 to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and now contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time then H is greater than 0**
