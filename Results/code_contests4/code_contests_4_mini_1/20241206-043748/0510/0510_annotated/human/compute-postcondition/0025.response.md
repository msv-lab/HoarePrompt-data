Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0; `b` is the first element of `B` (which is the maximum value in `B`, as it is sorted in descending order); and `b` is less than `am`.***
