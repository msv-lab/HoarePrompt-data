The value of `b` is assigned from `B[bi]`, where `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1. Since the value of `bi` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific value for `b`. Therefore, `h` is incremented by `b`, but we do not know the exact effect on `h` without knowing `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is increased by `b`, where `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`.**
