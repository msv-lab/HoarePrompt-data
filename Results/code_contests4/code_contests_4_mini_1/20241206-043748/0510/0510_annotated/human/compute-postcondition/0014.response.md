The code `B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. The previous value of `b` is assigned from the input, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. The list `B` is modified by adding the new element `b`, while other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the list `B`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `i` is 2; `A` now includes `a`; `B` now includes the previous elements plus `b`.**
