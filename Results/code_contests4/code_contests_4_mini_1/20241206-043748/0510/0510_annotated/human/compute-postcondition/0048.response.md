Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; if `b` is less than `am`, `c` is updated by adding `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variable `bi` is increased by 1.***
