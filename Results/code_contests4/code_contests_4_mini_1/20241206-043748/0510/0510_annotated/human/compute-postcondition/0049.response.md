Output State: **`h` is less than or equal to `H`, `c` is the total number of elements from `B` that were used, or if `b` is less than `am`, `c` is updated by `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`, and `bi` is the index of the first element in `B` that was not used. If all elements of `B` are used and `h` is still less than `H`, then `bi` is equal to the length of `B` minus 1.**
