The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on a series of inputs defined by the constraints given. Specifically, it relies on the following:

- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\).
- `H` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq H \leq 10^9\).
- Each \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) for \(i = 1\) to \(N\).

Based on the output description, the function performs computations based on these inputs but does not return a value in a conventional sense through parameters. Instead, it likely processes the input data and generates a result which is implied but not explicitly stated in the output.

Since there are no explicit return conditions or cases provided in the output description, we cannot specify different cases or return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on integer inputs N, H, and pairs (a_i, b_i) under specified constraints and likely produces a computed result based on these inputs.**
