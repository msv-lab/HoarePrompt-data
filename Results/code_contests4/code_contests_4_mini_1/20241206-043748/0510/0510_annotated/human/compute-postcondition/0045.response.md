The value of `b` is assigned from `B[bi]`, where `B` is sorted in descending order and contains an additional element -1. The impact of the code `h += b` means that `h` is increased by the value of `b`. However, the specific value of `b` is not provided in the initial state. The values of `N`, `A`, `i`, and `am` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is increased by `b`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is increased by `b`.**
