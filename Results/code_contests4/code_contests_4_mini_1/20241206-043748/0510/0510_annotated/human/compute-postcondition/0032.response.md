Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is updated according to the conditions: if `b` (the first element of `B`) is less than `am`, then `c` is updated by `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`, and `bi` is 0; otherwise, `h` is incremented by `b`, `c` is set to 1, and `bi` is updated to 1, with `b` being the first element of `B` that is greater than or equal to `am`.***
