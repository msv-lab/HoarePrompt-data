Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `A` contains `N` values of `a`, `B` is sorted in descending order and contains one additional element -1, `i` is `N - 1`, `am` is the maximum value in `A`, and `b` is assigned the value of `B[bi]`. If `b` is less than `am`, then `c` is incremented by the ceiling of ((H - h) / am) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `bi` is increased by 1.***
