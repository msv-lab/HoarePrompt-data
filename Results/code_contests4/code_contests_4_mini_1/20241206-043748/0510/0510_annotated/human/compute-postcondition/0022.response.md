The variable `bi` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in descending order and now contains one additional element -1; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0.
