The code `B.sort()` sorts the list `B` in ascending order. The values of the other variables (`N`, `A`, `i`, and `am`) remain unchanged after the sorting operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in ascending order; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` contains `N` values of `a`; `B` is sorted in ascending order; `i` is `N - 1`; `am` is the maximum value in `A.**
