According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `N` is within the range of 1 to 100,000, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 1. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
