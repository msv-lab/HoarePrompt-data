The function accepts two positive integers, `N` and `H`, representing the number of katanas and a health threshold, respectively. It reads `N` pairs of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, which represent the minimum and maximum damage values of each katana. The function calculates how many katanas from the maximum damage values can be used until the total damage reaches or exceeds `H`. If the maximum damage value of the katanas is less than the highest minimum damage value, the function estimates the number of additional hits needed based on the highest minimum damage value. Ultimately, it returns the total number of hits required, which could include additional hits if the maximum damage katanas are insufficient to reach `H`.
