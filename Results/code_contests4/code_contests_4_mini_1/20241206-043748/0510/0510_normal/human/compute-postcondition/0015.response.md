The loop iterates `N` times, during which it reads pairs of integers and appends them to the lists `A` and `B`. After all iterations, the lists `A` and `B` will each contain `N` elements, corresponding to the pairs of integers that were inputted.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a list containing `N` integers from the input.**
