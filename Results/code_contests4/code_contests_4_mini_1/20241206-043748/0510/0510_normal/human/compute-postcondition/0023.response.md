To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `h < H`. The variable `h` is currently set to 0, and for the loop to execute, `H` must be greater than `h`.

Given that `h` is 0, the loop will execute as long as `H` is greater than 0. However, we don't know the value of `H` from the provided state. Thus, we can conclude that in order for the loop to execute at least once, `H` needs to be greater than 0.

State adjustments are needed for `H` to ensure the loop condition can be satisfied. We can summarize the required conditions in the state:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` integers from the input; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; `B` now contains `N + 1` integers with the last integer being -1; `h` is 0; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time `H` must be greater than 0**
