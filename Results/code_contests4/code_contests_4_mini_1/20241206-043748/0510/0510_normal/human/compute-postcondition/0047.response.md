The value of `bi` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `bi` is unknown. The state of the variable `c` does not change during this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `c` is increased by 1; variable `bi` is increased by 1.

Output State: **variable `c` is increased by 1; variable `bi` is increased by 1**
