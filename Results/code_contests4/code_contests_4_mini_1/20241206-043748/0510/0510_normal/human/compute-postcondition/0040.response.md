Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; `h` is still less than `H`. If `b` is less than `am`, `c` is increased by `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `bi` is increased by 1.***
