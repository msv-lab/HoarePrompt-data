The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `a` and `b` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input is split into two parts and each part is converted to an integer. The previous values of `N` and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, and `a` and `b` are assigned values from input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are assigned values from input.**
