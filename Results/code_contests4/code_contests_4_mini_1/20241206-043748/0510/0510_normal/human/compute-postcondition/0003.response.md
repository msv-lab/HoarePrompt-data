According to the code, the loop will execute `N` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `N - 1`. The values of `H`, `A`, and `B` do not influence the execution of the loop itself. 

Since `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5), the loop can execute as long as `N` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute its first iteration. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
