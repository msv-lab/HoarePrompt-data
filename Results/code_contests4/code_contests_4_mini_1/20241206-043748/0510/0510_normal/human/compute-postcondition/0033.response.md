To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop condition is `h < H`. For the loop to execute again, the variable `h` must still be less than `H`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
   - `h` is currently less than `H`.
   - `b` is either less than `am` or greater than or equal to `am`, impacting how `h` and `c` are updated.
   - The maximum value `am` from the list `A` and the sorted list `B` with the last element being -1.

Assuming that the loop executed because `h` was less than `H`, we can conclude that the state of `h` must be adjusted if it has reached or is close to `H`. 

If `h` is already less than `H`, then no adjustments are needed, and we can repeat the program state.

However, if `h` was incremented by `b` (which is greater than or equal to `am`), we need to ensure that `h` remains less than `H` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, if `b` is indeed greater than or equal to `am` and has incremented `h`, we need to adjust `h` accordingly to ensure `h` is still less than `H`. This requires `h` to be updated to a value that remains less than `H`.

Since we are not provided with specific values, we cannot pinpoint exact adjustments. Therefore, the response will emphasize that `h` must remain less than `H`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; and for the loop to execute again, `h` is still less than `H`.**
