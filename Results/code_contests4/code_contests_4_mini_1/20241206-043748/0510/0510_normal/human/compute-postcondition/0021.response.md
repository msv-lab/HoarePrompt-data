`c` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables, `N`, `A`, `B`, `am`, and `h`, remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` integers from the input; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; `B` now contains `N + 1` integers with the last integer being -1; `h` is 0; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` integers from the input; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; `B` now contains `N + 1` integers with the last integer being -1; `h` is 0; `c` is 0.**
