Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` integers from the input and `N + 1` integers in total with the last integer being -1; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; `h` is `h + b`, where `b` is the first element of `B`, which is greater than or equal to `am`; `c` is 0; `bi` is 0; `b` is `B[0]`.**
