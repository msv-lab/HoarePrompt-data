The code snippet assigns values to `a` and `b` by taking input from the user and splitting it into two integers. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by the user input but do not alter the values of `N` or `i`. Since the specific values of `a` and `b` depend on the user input and are not predetermined, they will be treated as input integers. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `N` â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers**.
