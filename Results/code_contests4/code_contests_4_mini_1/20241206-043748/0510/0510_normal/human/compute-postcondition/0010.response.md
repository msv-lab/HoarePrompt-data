The code `B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. The initial state mentions that `A` now contains the value of `a` appended to it, but does not provide any information about `B` or `b`. Therefore, we can only conclude that `B` will contain an additional value after this execution. The values of `N`, `i`, and `A` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, `A` now contains the value of `a` appended to it, and `B` now contains the value of `b` appended to it.**
