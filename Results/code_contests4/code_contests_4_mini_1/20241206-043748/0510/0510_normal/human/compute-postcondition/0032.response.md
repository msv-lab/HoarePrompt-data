Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; if `b` (the first element of `B`) is less than `am`, then `c` is incremented by `int(ceil(H / am))`, while `h` remains 0 and `bi` is 0; otherwise, `h` is updated to `h + b`, `c` is set to 1, and `bi` is 1, with `b` being greater than or equal to `am`.***
