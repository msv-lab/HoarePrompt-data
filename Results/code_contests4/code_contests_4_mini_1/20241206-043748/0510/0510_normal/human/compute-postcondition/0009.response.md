The list `A` is appended with the value of `a`. The value of `a` is taken from the input and is not specified in the initial state. The other variables `N` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, `A` now contains the value of `a` appended to it.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, `A` now contains the value of `a` appended to it.**
