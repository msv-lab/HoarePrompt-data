Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N + 1` integers with the last element being -1; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; `h` is less than or equal to `H`; `c` is the count of how many elements from `B` were processed until `h` reached or exceeded `H`, or until a value in `B` less than `am` was found; `bi` is the index in `B` where the processing stopped, which could be equal to `N` if all elements were processed without encountering a value less than `am` before reaching `H`.**
