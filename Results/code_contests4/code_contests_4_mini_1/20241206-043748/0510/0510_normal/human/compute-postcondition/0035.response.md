The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`. The impact of this code involves calculating the difference between `H` and `h`, dividing that by `am`, and then taking the ceiling of the result before converting it to an integer. The variables `H`, `h`, and `am` are relevant to this calculation, while other variables remain unaffected.

Since `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`, and `h` is still less than `H`, we can conclude that the result of the expression `(H - h) * 1.0 / am` will yield a positive value, which, after applying the ceiling function and converting it to an integer, will increase `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is increased by `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`, where `H` is greater than `h`, `am` is the maximum value from `A`.

Output State: **`c` is increased by `int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am))`, where `H` is greater than `h`, `am` is the maximum value from `A`.**
