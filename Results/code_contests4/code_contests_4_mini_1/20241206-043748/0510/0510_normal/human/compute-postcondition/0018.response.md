The code `B.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `B`. The previous state of `B` was a sorted list containing `N` integers, and after executing the code, the order of the elements in `B` will change to be in reverse. The values of `N`, `A`, and `am` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new order of `B` after the reversal.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` integers from the input; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`.**
