The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^5; `A` is a list containing `N` integers from the input; `B` is a reversed sorted list containing `N` integers from the input and now contains `N + 1` integers with the last integer being -1; `am` is the maximum value from the list `A`; `h` is 0; `c` is incremented by `int(ceil(H / am))`; `bi` is 0; `b` is the first element of `B`, which is `B[0]`, and `b` is less than `am` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
