The value of `bi` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `bi` is unknown, so we can only state that the value of `bi` has increased by 1. The state of variable `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `c` is increased by 1; variable `bi` is increased by 1.

Output State: **variable `c` is increased by 1; variable `bi` is increased by 1**
