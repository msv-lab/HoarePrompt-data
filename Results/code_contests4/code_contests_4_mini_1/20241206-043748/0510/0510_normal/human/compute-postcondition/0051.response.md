The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), `H` is a positive integer (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9), and for each katana, `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

Since the output is not specified, we will assume that the function performs some operations based on the input constraints and returns a result based on those operations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate based on the constraints of N, H, and the katana parameters a_i and b_i, returning a result derived from these inputs.
