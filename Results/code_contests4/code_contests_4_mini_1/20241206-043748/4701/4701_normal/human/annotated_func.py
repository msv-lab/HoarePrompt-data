If `val` is not None, `goal` is a valid key in `seen`, `seen` remains unchanged, `q` is still empty, and the value of `val` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads dimensions and starting/goal positions from input, then processes a 2D grid to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the starting position to the goal position, avoiding obstacles represented by '#'. If the goal cannot be reached, it returns -1. The function does not handle invalid input cases or constraints directly, and it assumes the inputs adhere to specified limits.
