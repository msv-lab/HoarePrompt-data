According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 inclusive, which means it can execute a total of 5 times (for j = -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2). At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` would be 2, which is the last value in the range. Since the loop uses the `range(-2, 3)`, there are no more values for `j` to take. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` remains [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, `dy` is appended with -1 if `i` is not equal to `j` and `i` is not equal to 0, for the loop to execute again `j` must be able to take another value, but it cannot; hence the loop cannot execute again.**
