The code appends the value of `j` to the list `dy`. The previous value of `j` is -1, so after execution, `dy` will now include -1 as its last element. The values of the other variables (`goal`, `vvs`, `seen`, `q`, `dx`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, `dy` is now appended with -1.
