The code `dy.append(j)` appends the current value of `j`, which is 0, to the list `dy`. The list `dy` previously contained the values [-2, -1]. After executing the code, `dy` will now include an additional element, making it [-2, -1, 0]. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2, i], `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0], and `j` is 0.**
