The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`. The previous state of `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2]`, and since `j` is -2, the new state of `dy` will be `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i]`, `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2]`, and `j` is -2; `i` is not equal to `j`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
