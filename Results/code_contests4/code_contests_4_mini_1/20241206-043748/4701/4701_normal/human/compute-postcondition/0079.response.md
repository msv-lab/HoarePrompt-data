Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` remains [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, `dy` is appended with -1 if `i` is not equal to `j` and `i` is not equal to 0; hence the loop cannot execute again, and `dx` is updated to include `i`.**
