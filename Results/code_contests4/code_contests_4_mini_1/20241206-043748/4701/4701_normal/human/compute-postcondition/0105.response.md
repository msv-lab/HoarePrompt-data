The code `dx.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `dx`. The previous state of `dx` contains `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i]`. After executing the code, `dx` will now have one additional element, which is the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `dx` and the unchanged states of other variables.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i, i]`; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1]`; `j` is 0; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 3.**
