The value of `dx` is modified by appending `i` to it. The current value of `i` is -2, so after execution, `dx` will now contain two elements: -2 and -2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2], `dy` is now [-2], and `j` is -1.
