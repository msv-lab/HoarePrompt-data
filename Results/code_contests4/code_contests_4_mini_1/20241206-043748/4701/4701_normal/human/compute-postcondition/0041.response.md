Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2], `dy` is now [-2], `vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2, `j` is -2, and it holds that `i` is equal to `j` or `j` is equal to 0.***
