The value of `i` is not equal to -2 and not equal to 0, so the specific value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The previous values of `dx` are `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i]`, and after executing `dx.append(i)`, `dx` will now include the current value of `i` as the last element. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i]`; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2]`; `j` is -1.
