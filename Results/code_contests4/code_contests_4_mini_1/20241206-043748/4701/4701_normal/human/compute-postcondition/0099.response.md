The value of `j`, which is -1, is appended to the list `dy`. The `dy` list is modified to include this new value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i]`; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1]`; `j` is -1.
