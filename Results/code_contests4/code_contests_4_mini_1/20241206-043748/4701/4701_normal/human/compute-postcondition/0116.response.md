Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`; `vvs` contains `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`; `ux` and `uy` are assigned the values of `divmod(pu, w)`; `pu` is equal to `goal`.***
