Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2], `dy` is now [-2, -1], `j` is -1; if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, the value 1 is appended to the list `vvs`. Otherwise, 0 is appended to the list `vvs`.***
