Output State: **`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each position represented by `u` for all valid (x, y) coordinates in the grid, `q` is empty as all reachable positions have been processed, and `pnum` and `pu` correspond to the last values processed before the loop ended. If `pu` equals `goal`, then the loop exited successfully; otherwise, `seen` remains unchanged from the last valid update.**
