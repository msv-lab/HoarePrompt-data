The variables `ux` and `uy` have been assigned the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, and now `x` and `y` are being updated based on the new values of `ux` and `uy`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are unchanged. Therefore, after execution, `x` is updated to `ux + xx` and `y` is updated to `uy + yy`. The states of `pnum`, `pu`, `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`pnum` and `pu` from `hpp(q)`; `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`.**
