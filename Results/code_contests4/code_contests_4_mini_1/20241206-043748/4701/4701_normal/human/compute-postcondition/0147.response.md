Postcondition: ***`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y` and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`; otherwise, no changes occur in `seen[u]`.***
