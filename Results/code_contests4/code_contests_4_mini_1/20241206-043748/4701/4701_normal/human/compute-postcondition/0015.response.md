To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop and the state variables provided.

1. The loop iterates over `range(rows)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `rows` must be greater than 0. From the initial state, we know that `rows` is equal to `h`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, `rows` is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

2. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 since `range(rows)` generates a sequence starting from 0 up to `rows - 1`.

Given the above reasoning, we can summarize the states before the loop starts:

- `H` and `W` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, which do not affect the execution of the loop.
- `h` and `w` are the input values converted to integers, ensuring `h` (and thus `rows`) is a positive integer.
- `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, and `dw` being decreased by 1 do not influence the loop's execution.
- `OK`, `NG`, `ns`, and `ss` are initialized states that do not affect the loop's execution.

Thus, before the loop starts, the following conditions are in place:

- `rows` is equal to `h`, which is a positive integer, confirming that the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`H` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `W` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `w` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is `h`, `cols` is `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is initialized as a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of `h` None values, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0.**
