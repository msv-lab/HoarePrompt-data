Output State: **`pnum` and `pu` are from `hpp(q)`; `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `seen[u]` is now equal to `num`; `hp(q, (num, u))` is executed.**
