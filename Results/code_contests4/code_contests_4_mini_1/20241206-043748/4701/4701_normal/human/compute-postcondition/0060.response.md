According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive). The value of `i` will take on the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 during its iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 2, which is the last value in the specified range. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment to 3, but since the range only goes up to 2, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2], `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0], and `vvs` contains [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The loop will not execute again since `i` cannot be 3 within the defined range.**
