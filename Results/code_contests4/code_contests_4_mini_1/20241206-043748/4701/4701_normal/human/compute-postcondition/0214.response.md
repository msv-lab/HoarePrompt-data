Postcondition: ***`seen` remains unchanged; if `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` equals '#', then `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, continuing to the next iteration without making any changes to the current state.***
