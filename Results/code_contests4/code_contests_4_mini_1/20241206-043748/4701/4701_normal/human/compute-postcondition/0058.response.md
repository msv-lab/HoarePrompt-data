Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2, i], `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0], and `j` is 0. If `i` and `j` are not both zero, if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then 1 is appended to the list `vvs`; otherwise, 0 is appended to the list `vvs`. If `i` and `j` are both zero, no changes occur in the lists or variables.***
