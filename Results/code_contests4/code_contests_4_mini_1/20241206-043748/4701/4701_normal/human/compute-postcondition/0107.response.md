The code appends the value `1` to the list `vvs`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, as the only operation performed is adding an element to the list. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial conditions, but now includes the updated state of the `vvs` list.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i, i]`; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1, 0]; `j` is 0; `vvs` now includes `1`.**
