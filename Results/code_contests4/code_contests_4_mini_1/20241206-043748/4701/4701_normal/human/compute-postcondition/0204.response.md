The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` remains unchanged, `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
