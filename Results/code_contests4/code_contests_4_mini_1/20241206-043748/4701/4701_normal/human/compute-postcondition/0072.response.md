The value of `dx` is modified by appending the value of `i` to it. The previous values of `dx` are unchanged, which are `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`. After executing the code, `dx` will include the new value `i`. Since `i` is not equal to `0`, it is added to the end of the list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, `dy` remains unchanged as [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0], `i` is not equal to `j`, `i` is not equal to 0, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is -1.
