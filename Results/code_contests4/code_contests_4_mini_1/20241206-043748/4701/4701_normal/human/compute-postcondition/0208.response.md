Postcondition: ***`seen` remains unchanged. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, where `num` equals `pnum + vv`, and the function calls `hp(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and not greater than `num`, no changes are made to `seen` and no additional actions are performed.***
