Output State: **`pnum` and `pu` are from `hpp(q)`; `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`; `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
