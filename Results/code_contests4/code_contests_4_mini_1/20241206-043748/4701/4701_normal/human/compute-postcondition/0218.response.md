Output State: **`seen` is updated such that for each valid `(x, y)` position derived from `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` contains the minimum value of `num`, which is computed as `pnum + vv`. The values of `ux` and `uy` remain unchanged, and `pnum`, `vv`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `w`, `h`, and `ss` also remain unchanged. If the loop does not execute, `seen` remains unchanged.**
