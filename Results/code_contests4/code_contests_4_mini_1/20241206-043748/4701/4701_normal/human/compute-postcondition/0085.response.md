Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` contains `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]` where `i` is the last value processed in the loop, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, j]` where `j` is the last value processed in the loop, and `vvs` is updated to include values based on the conditions applied during the iterations.`**
