`dy` is a list that already contains values `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1]`, and `j` is currently 0. The code appends the value of `j` to the end of the `dy` list. Therefore, after execution, `dy` will include an additional element with the value of `j`, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i, i]`; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1, 0]`; `j` is 0; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 3.**
