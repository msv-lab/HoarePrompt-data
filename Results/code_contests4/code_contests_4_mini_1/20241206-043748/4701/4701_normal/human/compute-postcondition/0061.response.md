According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from -2 to 2, inclusive. The current state does not provide information about `j`, but since the loop starts from -2, `j` can be initialized to -2 for the first iteration. The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range specified. 

However, since the problem states that "the loop will not execute again since `i` cannot be 3 within the defined range," it indicates that `i` is not relevant to the execution of this loop and may be a separate concern. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the only adjustment needed is to set `j` to its initial value of -2.

State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2], `dy` is now [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0], `vvs` contains [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], `j` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time**
