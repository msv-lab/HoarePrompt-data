The value of `ch` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `ch` is unknown since it was assigned from `input()`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` and `W` remain positive integers between 1 and 1000; `h` and `w` are assigned the values from `input()` after being split and converted to integers; `ch` is decreased by 1; `cw` is assigned the input values converted to integers; `dh` and `dw` are assigned the values from `input()` split and converted to integers.

Output State: **`H` and `W` remain positive integers between 1 and 1000; `h` and `w` are assigned the values from `input()` after being split and converted to integers; `ch` is decreased by 1; `cw` is assigned the input values converted to integers; `dh` and `dw` are assigned the values from `input()` split and converted to integers.**
