The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The values of `pnum` and `vv` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `num`. Other variables are not affected, and the initial calculation of `u` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as (ux - 2) * w + (uy - 2); `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`u` is calculated as (ux - 2) * w + (uy - 2); `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv**
