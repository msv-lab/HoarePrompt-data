`dx` is modified by appending the value of `i`, which is -2. The previous value of `dx` is an empty list, so after execution, `dx` will contain one element: -2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2], `dy` is an empty list, `vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2, `j` is -2, and it holds that `i` is not equal to `j` and `j` is not equal to 0.
