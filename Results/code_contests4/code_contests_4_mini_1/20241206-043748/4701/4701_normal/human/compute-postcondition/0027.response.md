To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`.
2. The initial state indicates that `dh` is decreased by 1, and `dw` is decreased by 1, but the exact values of `dh` and `dw` after decrement are not provided.
3. The calculations for `goal` will depend on the updated values of `dh` and `dw` after their decrements.

Given this, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- `goal` is calculated based on the decremented values of `dh` and `dw`, but since we do not have specific values for `dh` and `dw`, we can only express the relationship.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`**
