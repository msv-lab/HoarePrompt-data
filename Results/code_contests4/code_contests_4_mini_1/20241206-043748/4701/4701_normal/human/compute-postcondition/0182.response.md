Postcondition: ***`seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` remain unchanged. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num` and the hp function is called with arguments (num, u). If `seen[u]` is already less than or equal to `num`, there are no changes made to `seen[u]` or the state of the program.***
