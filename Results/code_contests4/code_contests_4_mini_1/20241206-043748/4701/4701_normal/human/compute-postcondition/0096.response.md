Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i]`; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2]`; `j` is -2; if `i` is not equal to `j` and `i` is not equal to 0, then if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` is updated by appending the value 1; otherwise, if the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` is updated by appending 0. If `i` is equal to `j` or `i` is equal to 0, the program execution does not change the state.***
