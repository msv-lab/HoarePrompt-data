Postcondition: ***`pnum` and `pu` are from `hpp(q)`, `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; if `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and `seen[u]` is now equal to `num`, followed by the execution of `hp(q, (num, u))`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variable values.***
