Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`. If the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` remains as [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Otherwise, if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is 1 or less, then `vvs` is updated to [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, with `seen[start]` set to 0, and `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), while `dx` and `dy` remain unchanged as `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]` and `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2]` respectively. Additionally, `j` is -2, and `i` is not equal to `j`, and neither `i` nor `j` is equal to 0.***
