According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2, which means the loop will execute for `j` values of -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to -1. 

Since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than 3, the next value of `j` being -1 is valid. The loop will now check the conditions related to `i` and `j` for this new `j` value.

State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i]`; `dy` is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2]`; `i` is not equal to -2 and `i` is not equal to 0, then if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and -1 is greater than 1, `vvs` is updated by appending the value 1; otherwise, if the absolute sum of `i` and -1 is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` is updated by appending 0; `j` is -1.**
