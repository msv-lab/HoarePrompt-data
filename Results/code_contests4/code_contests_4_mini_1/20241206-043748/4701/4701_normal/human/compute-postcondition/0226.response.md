The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on external constraints involving positive integers and a 2D list of characters. The constraints specify that:

- `H` and `W` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq H, W \leq 1000 \).
- `C_h`, `C_w`, `D_h`, and `D_w` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq C_h, D_h \leq H \) and \( 1 \leq C_w, D_w \leq W \).
- `S` is a 2D list of characters consisting of `'#'` and `'.'` with the conditions that `S[C_h][C_w]` and `S[D_h][D_w]` are `'.'`, and that the coordinates `(C_h, C_w)` and `(D_h, D_w)` are not equal.

The output of the function is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return values or outcomes based on the provided constraints.
