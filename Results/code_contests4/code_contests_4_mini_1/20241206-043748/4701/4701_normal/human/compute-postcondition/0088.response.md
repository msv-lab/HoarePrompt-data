Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` contains `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2]`, and `j` is -2. It is also true that `i` is not equal to `j`, and `i` is not equal to 0, which means that both `i` and `j` cannot be 0 at the same time.***
