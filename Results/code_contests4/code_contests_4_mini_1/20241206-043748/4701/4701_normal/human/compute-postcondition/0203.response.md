The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value of `num`. The other variables (`seen`, `x`, `y`, `u`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` remains unchanged, `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`seen` remains unchanged, `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.**
