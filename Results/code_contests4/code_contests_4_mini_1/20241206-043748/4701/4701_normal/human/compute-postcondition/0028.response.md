The code initializes the variable `seen` as a list containing `None` repeated `n` times. The previous state of `goal` is not affected by this assignment, and there are no changes to `goal`, `dh`, `w`, or `dw`. Therefore, the output state is that `goal` remains calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)` and `seen` is now a list of `None` values of length `n`.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times.**
