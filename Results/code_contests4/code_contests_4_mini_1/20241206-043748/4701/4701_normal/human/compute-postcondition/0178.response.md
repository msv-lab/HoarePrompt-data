The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`; `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
