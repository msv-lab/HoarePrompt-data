The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The value of `pnum` is taken from `hpp(q)`, and `vv` is unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `num` is now the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pnum` and `pu` are from `hpp(q)`; `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`; `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`.**
