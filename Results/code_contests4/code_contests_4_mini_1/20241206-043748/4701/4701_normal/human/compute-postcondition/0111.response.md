Initial State: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` contains `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, j]` where `j` is the last value processed in the loop, and `vvs` is updated to include values based on the conditions applied during the iterations.

After the loop executes:
- The range for `j` is from -2 to 2 (inclusive), resulting in 5 iterations (for `j = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2`).
- During these iterations, `dx` will be appended with the value of `i` (if `i` is not equal to `j` and `i` is not equal to 0), and `dy` will be appended with values of `j`.
- The `vvs` list will be updated based on the conditions provided.

After all iterations of the loop:
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `dx` will contain `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i, i]` (assuming `i` is not equal to any of the `j` values except during the condition checks).
- `dy` will contain `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2]` (appending each value of `j`).
- The `vvs` list will have 5 elements based on the conditions applied throughout the iterations, which will depend on the values of `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i, i]`; `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`; `vvs` is updated based on the conditions applied through all iterations.**
