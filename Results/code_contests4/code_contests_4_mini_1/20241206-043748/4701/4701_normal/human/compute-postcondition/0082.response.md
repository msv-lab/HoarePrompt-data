The value `0` is appended to the list `vvs`, which changes the last element of `vvs` from `1` to `0`, resulting in `vvs` now being [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, and `dy` now includes the value of `j`.
