Output State: **H and W are positive integers such that 1 <= H, W <= 1000; C_h, C_w, D_h, and D_w are positive integers such that 1 <= C_h, D_h <= H and 1 <= C_w, D_w <= W; S is a 2D list of characters consisting of '#' and '.' with S[C_h][C_w] and S[D_h][D_w] being '.'; (C_h, C_w) is not equal to (D_h, D_w); `input` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and removes trailing whitespace.**
