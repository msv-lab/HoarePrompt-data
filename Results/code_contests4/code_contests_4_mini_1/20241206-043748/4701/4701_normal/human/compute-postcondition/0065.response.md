Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2]`, `vvs` contains [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], `j` is -2, `i` is not equal to `j`, and neither `i` nor `j` is equal to 0. The sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1.***
