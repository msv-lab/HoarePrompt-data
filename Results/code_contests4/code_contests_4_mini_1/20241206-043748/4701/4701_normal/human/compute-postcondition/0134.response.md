The code `continue` causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables remain unchanged in this context, we note that there are no updates or returns from the code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
