The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous states of the variables `pnum` and `vv` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `num`. The other variables `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**.
