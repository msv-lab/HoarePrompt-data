The code `vvs.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `vvs`. The previous state of `vvs` is `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. After executing the code, `vvs` will now include the new value `0`, resulting in the updated list being `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `vvs` is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`; `dy` is now appended with -1.**
