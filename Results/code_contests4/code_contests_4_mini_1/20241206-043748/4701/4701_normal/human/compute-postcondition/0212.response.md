The variable `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `num`. The other variables (`seen`, `x`, `y`, and `u`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen` remains unchanged; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`seen` remains unchanged; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`.**
