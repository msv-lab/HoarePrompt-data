Postcondition: ***`seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`, and the function `hp` is called with parameters `(num, u)`, while `pnum` and `pu` are derived from `hpp(q)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and less than or equal to `num`, no changes occur.***
