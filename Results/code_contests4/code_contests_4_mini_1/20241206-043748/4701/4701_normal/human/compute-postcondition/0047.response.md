The code `dy.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `dy`. The current value of `j` is -1. Therefore, after executing this line, `dy` will include -1 as its last element. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2], `dy` is now [-2, -1], and `j` is -1.**
