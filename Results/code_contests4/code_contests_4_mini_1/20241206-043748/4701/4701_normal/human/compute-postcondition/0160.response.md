Postcondition: ***`pnum` and `pu` are from `hpp(q)`; `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, while no other variable values are changed.***
