The code `dy.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `dy`. Since `j` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` remains [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, and `dy` now includes the value of `j`.
