Postcondition: ***`pnum` and `pu` are derived from `hpp(q)`; `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the value `ss[x][y]` is '#', then `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`, `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
