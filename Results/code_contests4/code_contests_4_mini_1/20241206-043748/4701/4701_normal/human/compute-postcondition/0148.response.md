Output State: **`seen` contains the minimum number of steps to reach each position represented by `u`, where `u` corresponds to valid (x, y) coordinates in the grid; `q` contains tuples representing the positions and their associated step counts that can be processed, and `x` and `y` are updated based on the last iteration's calculations.**
