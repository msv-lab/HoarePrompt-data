Postcondition: ***`seen` remains unchanged; if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, `seen[u]` is updated to `num`, and the `hp` function is called with parameters `(num, u)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
