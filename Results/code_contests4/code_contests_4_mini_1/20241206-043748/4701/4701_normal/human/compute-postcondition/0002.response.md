Output State: **`H` and `W` remain positive integers between 1 and 1000; `C_h`, `C_w`, `D_h`, and `D_w` remain positive integers within their respective bounds; `S` remains a 2D list of characters consisting of '#' and '.'; `input` remains a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and removes trailing whitespace; recursion limit is set to a maximum value of 1000 or 10^9, whichever is larger; `write` is a lambda function that outputs a string with a newline.**
