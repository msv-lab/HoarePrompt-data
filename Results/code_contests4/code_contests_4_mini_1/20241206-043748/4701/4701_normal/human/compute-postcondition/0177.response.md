The value of `num` is assigned the expression `pnum + vv`. The states of the variables `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`; `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`; `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`.**
