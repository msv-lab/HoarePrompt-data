The code `vvs.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the end of the list `vvs`. The previous values of `vvs` are `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. After executing the code, `vvs` will be `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`, `dy` is now appended with -1**.
