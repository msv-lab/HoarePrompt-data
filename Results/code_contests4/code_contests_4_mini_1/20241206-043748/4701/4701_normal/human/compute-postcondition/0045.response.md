According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become -1. Since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than 3, it can execute again.

State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2], `dy` is now [-2], and `i` is -2, `j` is -1. The loop will execute again with `j` equal to -1.**
