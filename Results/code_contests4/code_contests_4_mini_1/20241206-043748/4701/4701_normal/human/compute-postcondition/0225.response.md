Postcondition: ***`val` is assigned the value of `seen[goal]`. If `val` is None, `goal` is a valid key in `seen`, `seen` remains unchanged, `q` is still empty, and -1 is printed. If `val` is not None, `goal` is a valid key in `seen`, `seen` remains unchanged, `q` is still empty, and the value of `val` is printed.***
