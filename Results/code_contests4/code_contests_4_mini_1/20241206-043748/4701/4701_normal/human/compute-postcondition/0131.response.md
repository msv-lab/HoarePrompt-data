In the provided code snippet, `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy`. The values of `ux` and `uy` are previously calculated, and `xx` is the next element from `dx`, while `yy` is the next element from `dy`. 

The impact of the code is as follows:
- `x` is updated to `ux + xx`.
- `y` is updated to `uy + yy`.

Since the initial state mentions that `u` is calculated as a function of `ux` and `uy`, and `xx` and `yy` are derived from the next elements of `dx` and `dy`, the values of `x` and `y` will be new calculated values based on these inputs.

However, because the specific values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are not provided, we cannot state their exact values. Thus, we can only indicate that `x` and `y` are newly calculated based on the previous state.

Output State: **`x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`.**
