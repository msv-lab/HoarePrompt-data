Postcondition: ***`pnum` and `pu` are from `hpp(q)`; `seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The value of `x` is less than 0 or the value of `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or the value of `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'.***
