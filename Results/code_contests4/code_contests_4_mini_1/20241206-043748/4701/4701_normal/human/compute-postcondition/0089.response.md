The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The initial state indicates that `dx` contains the values `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`. After appending `i`, `dx` will now have one additional value at the end of the list. The previous values of `i` and `j` do not affect this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `dx`.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i]`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2]`, and `j` is -2. `i` is not equal to `j`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
