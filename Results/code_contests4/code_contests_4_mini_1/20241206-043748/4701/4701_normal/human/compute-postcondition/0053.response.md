The code appends the value of `i` to the list `dx`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged, but `dx` will have an additional element appended to it.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2, -2, i], `dy` is now [-2, -1], and `j` is 0.**
