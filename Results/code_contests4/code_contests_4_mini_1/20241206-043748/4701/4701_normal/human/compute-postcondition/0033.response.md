The statement initializes an empty list `vvs`, which does not affect any of the previously defined variables. The values of `goal`, `seen`, `q`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times; `seen[start]` is set to 0; `q` is initialized as a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is an empty list; `dy` is an empty list; `vvs` is an empty list.

Output State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times; `seen[start]` is set to 0; `q` is initialized as a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is an empty list; `dy` is an empty list; `vvs` is an empty list.**
