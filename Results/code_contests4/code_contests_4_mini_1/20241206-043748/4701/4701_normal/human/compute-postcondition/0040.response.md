The value `1` is appended to the list `vvs`. The previous state of `vvs` was an empty list, so after execution, `vvs` will contain the value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now [-2], `dy` is now [-2], `vvs` is now [1], `i` is -2, `j` is -2, and it holds that `i` is not equal to `j`, `j` is not equal to 0, and the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1.
