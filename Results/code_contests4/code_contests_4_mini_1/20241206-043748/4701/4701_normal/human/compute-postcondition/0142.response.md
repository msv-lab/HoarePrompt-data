The variable `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `pnum` or `vv`, so we cannot determine a specific value for `num`. The values of `u`, `x`, `y`, and `w` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
