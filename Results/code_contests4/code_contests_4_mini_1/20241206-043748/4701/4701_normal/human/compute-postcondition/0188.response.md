Postcondition: ***`seen` remains unchanged; `pnum` and `pu` are derived from `hpp(q)`; `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; if `pu` equals `goal`, then `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, and `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
