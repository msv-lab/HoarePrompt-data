According to the code, the for loop will iterate over the range from -2 to 2, inclusive, which means it will execute for the values of `i` being -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. The initial state mentions the value of `goal`, the list `seen`, and the initialization of `q`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. 

The loop itself does not depend on any conditions other than the initialization of `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, we only need to ensure that the loop variable `i` is correctly initialized at the start of the loop. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i`, which begins at -2. 

State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times, `seen[start]` is set to 0, `q` is initialized as a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is an empty list, `dy` is an empty list, `vvs` is an empty list, `i` is -2**
