Postcondition: ***`u` is calculated as (ux - 2) * w + (uy - 2); `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp(q, (num, u))` is executed. If the program skips the iteration, it means that either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#'.***
