According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over the range from -2 to 2, inclusive. This means that the loop will execute for five iterations: when `j` is -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. 

The state variables that need to be considered here are `goal`, `seen`, `q`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. 

The variable `j` is directly affected by the loop, and it will take on the values specified by the range. Since the loop will execute five times, we can set the initial value of `j` to -2, which is the starting point of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to establish that `j` starts at -2 and understand that it will change during each iteration. Other state variables such as `goal`, `seen`, `q`, `dx`, and `vvs` can remain as they are since they don't influence the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` contains `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, `dy` contains `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2]`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is -2**.
