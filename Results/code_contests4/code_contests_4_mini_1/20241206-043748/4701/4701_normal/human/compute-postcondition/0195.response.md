Postcondition: ***`seen` remains unchanged; `num` is `pnum + vv`; `w` remains unchanged; `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`. If `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#', the next iteration of the loop is continued.***
