The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop, meaning that the control will move to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current loop body. No variable values are changed by the `continue` statement itself. The states of `u`, `num`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as (ux - 2) * w + (uy - 2); `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#', and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
