Postcondition: ***`seen`, `w`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` remain unchanged; if `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or the value at `ss[x][y]` is `'#'`, then `x` is assigned the value `ux + xx`, `y` is assigned the value `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, proceeding to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
