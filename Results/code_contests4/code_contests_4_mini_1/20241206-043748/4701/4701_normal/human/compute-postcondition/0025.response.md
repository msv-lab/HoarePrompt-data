The variable `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`. The values of `rows` and `cols` are `h` and `w`, respectively. Therefore, `n` will be equal to `h * w`. The specific values of `h` and `w` are not provided, so we cannot determine an exact value for `n`. However, we can state that `n` depends on the product of `h` and `w`.

Output State: **`H` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `W` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `h` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is `h`, `cols` is `w`, `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#', `ns` is initialized as a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is a list of `h` strings (if `h` > 0) or `h` None values (if `h` = 0); `n` is `h * w`.**
