The values of `ch` and `cw` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input after splitting. The values of `h` and `w` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `ch` and `cw` based on the input provided, while `H`, `W`, `h`, and `w` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` and `W` remain positive integers between 1 and 1000; `h` and `w` are assigned the values from `input()` after being split and converted to integers; `ch` and `cw` are assigned the input values converted to integers.**
