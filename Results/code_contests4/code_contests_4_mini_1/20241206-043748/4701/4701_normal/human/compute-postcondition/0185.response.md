Output State: **`seen` remains unchanged; `pnum` and `pu` are derived from `hpp(q)`; `w`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged; for each valid `u`, `seen[u]` is the minimum value of `num` encountered during the iterations, and `hp` has been called with all valid `(num, u)` pairs where `seen[u]` was updated.**
