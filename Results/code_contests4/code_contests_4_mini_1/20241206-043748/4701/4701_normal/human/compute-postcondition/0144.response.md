Postcondition: ***`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y` and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
