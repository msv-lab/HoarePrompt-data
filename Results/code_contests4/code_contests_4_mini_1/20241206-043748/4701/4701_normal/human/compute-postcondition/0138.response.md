Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are updated based on `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is '#', the loop continues to the next iteration without any further updates.***
