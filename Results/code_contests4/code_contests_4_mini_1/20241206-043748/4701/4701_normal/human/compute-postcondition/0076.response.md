Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`, `vvs` remains [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] if `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1`, otherwise `vvs` is updated to [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, i]`; `dy` is now appended with -1.***
