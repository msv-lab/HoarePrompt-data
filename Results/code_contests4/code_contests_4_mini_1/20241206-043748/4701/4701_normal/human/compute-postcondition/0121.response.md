To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first need to analyze the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. The variables `ux` and `uy` are assigned the values from `divmod(pu, w)`. This calculates how many times `w` fits into `pu` and the remainder.
2. `xx` is -2 and `yy` is -2.
3. The variable `x` is calculated as `ux + xx`, which means we will add `xx` (-2) to `ux`.
4. The variable `y` is calculated as `uy + yy`, which means we will add `yy` (-2) to `uy`.
5. The variable `u` is then calculated as `x * w + y`.

Since we have not been provided with specific values for `pu`, `w`, or `n`, we can only express `u` in terms of the variables `ux`, `uy`, `w`, `xx`, and `yy`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `u` using the derived values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`u` is calculated as (ux - 2) * w + (uy - 2)**
