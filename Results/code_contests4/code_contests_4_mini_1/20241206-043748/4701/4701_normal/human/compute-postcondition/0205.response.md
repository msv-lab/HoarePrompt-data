Postcondition: ***`seen` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then `x` is updated to `ux + xx`, `y` is updated to `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
