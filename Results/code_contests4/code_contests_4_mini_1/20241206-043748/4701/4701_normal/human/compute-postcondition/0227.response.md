Functionality: ** The function reads dimensions and starting/goal positions from input, then processes a 2D grid to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the starting position to the goal position, avoiding obstacles represented by '#'. If the goal cannot be reached, it returns -1. The function does not handle invalid input cases or constraints directly, and it assumes the inputs adhere to specified limits. **
