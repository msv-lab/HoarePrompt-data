The variable `dx` is initialized as an empty list. This operation does not affect the previous values of the other variables (`goal`, `seen`, `q`), which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times; `seen[start]` is set to 0; `q` is initialized as a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is an empty list.
