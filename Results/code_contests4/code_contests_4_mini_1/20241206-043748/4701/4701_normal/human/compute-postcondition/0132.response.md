The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The values of `x` and `y` have been previously updated, but `w` is unknown. Therefore, the exact value of `u` cannot be determined without knowing `w`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`**
