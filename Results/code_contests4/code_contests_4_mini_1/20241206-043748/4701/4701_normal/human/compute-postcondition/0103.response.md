Postcondition: ***`goal` is calculated as `(dh - 1) * w + (dw - 1)`; `seen` is a list of `None` repeated `n` times with `seen[start]` set to 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is now `[-2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, i, i]`; `dy` is now `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -2, -2, -1]`; `j` is -1; if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and -1 is greater than 1, 1 is appended to `vvs`; otherwise, 0 is appended to `vvs`. If `i` equals `j` and both are 0, the else part does not apply.***
