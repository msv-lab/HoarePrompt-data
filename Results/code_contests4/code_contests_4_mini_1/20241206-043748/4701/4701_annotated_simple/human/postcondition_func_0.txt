The function accepts the dimensions of a maze (H and W) and the coordinates of a starting point (C_h, C_w) and a destination (D_h, D_w), as well as a 2D list (S) representing the maze structure. It implements a search algorithm to determine the minimum cost to reach the destination from the starting point while navigating around obstacles (represented by '#'). If a valid path exists, it returns the minimum cost; if no path exists, it returns -1. The function does not return True or False, as indicated in the annotations.
