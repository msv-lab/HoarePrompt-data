Postcondition: ***`num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`; `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` equals '#', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without changing `num`, `x`, `y`, or `u`.***
