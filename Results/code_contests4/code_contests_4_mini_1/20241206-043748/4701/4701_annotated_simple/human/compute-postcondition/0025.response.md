The variable `n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`. The previous values of `rows` and `cols` are `H` and `W`, respectively. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `H * W`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is updated with `H` input strings, `i` is equal to `H`, and `n` is assigned the value of `H * W`.**
