According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` variables. The loop will iterate over the values in `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`, which means that each of these must have at least one element. Given that `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `vvs` contains corresponding values, we can confirm that they are all populated.

For the loop to execute the first time, the variables `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` will take their first values from `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`, respectively. This means:

- `xx` will be the first element of `dx`, which is -2.
- `yy` will be the first element of `dy`, which is -2.
- `vv` will be the first corresponding value from `vvs`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the assignments of `xx`, `yy`, and `vv` to their first values from `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, and `seen` reflects the minimum values of `num` for each valid `u` calculated, `xx` is -2, `yy` is -2, `vv` is the first value from `vvs` for the loop to execute the first time.**
