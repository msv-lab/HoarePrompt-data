According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive). The current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration is -2. In the next iteration, the value of `j` will be incremented by 1, which will result in `j` being -1.

To determine the conditions for the loop to execute again, we look at the next value of `j`, which is -1. Since `i` is not equal to -2 or 0, we need to consider what updates will occur. The updates for `dx` and `dy` depend on the value of `i`, which has not changed and is unspecified in this context.

For the loop to execute a second time, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `j` will be -1.
- The state does not provide a specific value for `i`, but it is implied that `i` could be any value except -2 or 0 to trigger the updates of `dx` and `dy`.
- The sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` will determine the update to `vvs`. 

The conditions based on the previous iteration can be summarized as follows:

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is -1, if `i` is not equal to -2 or 0, then `dx` will include the value of `i` and `dy` will include -1; if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` will include the value 1, otherwise if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to 1, then `vvs` will include 0.**
