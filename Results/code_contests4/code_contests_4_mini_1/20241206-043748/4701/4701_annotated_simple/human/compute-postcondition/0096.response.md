Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it. If `i` and `j` are not both zero, the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` determines that if the sum is greater than 1, `vvs` has 1 appended to it; otherwise, if the sum is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` includes 0 appended to it. If `i` and `j` are both zero, no changes occur to `dx`, `dy`, or `vvs`.***
