Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2; `dy` includes the value `j` and has the additional value `j` appended to it; if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` now includes the value `1`. Otherwise, `vvs` now includes an additional element, 0.***
