According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates through the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it will execute for `j` values of -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, a total of 5 times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken a value of 2 (the last value in the range). Since the loop increments `j` by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be 3. However, since the range is from -2 to 2, and `j` cannot exceed 2, the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, while `H`, `W`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` remain unchanged, the important factor is that `j` has reached the maximum value in the range, and there are no additional iterations possible.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it; `vvs` has been modified based on the values of `i` and `j`, but the loop cannot execute again as `j` is 3 and exceeds the range.**
