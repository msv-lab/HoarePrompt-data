The variable `dy` is assigned an empty list. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `dy`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is updated with `H` input strings, `i` is equal to `H`, `n` is assigned the value of `H * W`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * W + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * W + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with None values, `seen[start]` is assigned the value 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is an empty list, `dy` is an empty list.**
