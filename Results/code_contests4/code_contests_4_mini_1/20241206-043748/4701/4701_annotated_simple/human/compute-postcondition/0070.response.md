Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, and `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2. If `i` is not equal to `j` and both are not 0, and if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` includes an additional 1; otherwise, `vvs` is updated to include another 0.***
