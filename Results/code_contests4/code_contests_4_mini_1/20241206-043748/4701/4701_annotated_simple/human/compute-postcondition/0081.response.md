The value `1` is appended to the list `vvs`. The previous state of the variables does not change except for `vvs`, which will now include the additional value `1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2; `dy` includes the value `j` and now `dy` has the additional value `j` appended to it; `vvs` now includes the value `1`.
