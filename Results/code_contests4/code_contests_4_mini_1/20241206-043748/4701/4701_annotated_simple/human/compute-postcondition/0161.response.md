Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains at least one value, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `x` is `ux - 2`, `y` is `uy - 2`, `u` is calculated as `u = (ux - 2) * W + (uy - 2)`, `num` is `pnum + vv`, either `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`. Additionally, either `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is less than `H`, `y` is less than `W`, and the value of `ss[x][y]` is not `'#'`.***
