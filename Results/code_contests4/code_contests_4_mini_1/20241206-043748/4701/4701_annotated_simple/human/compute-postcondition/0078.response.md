According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2, which includes the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. The current state indicates that `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, and `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2. The variable `j` will take on each value in the specified range during the loop iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed `j` for a certain value, which can be determined as follows:

- If the last processed value of `j` was -2, the next value will be -1.
- If it was -1, the next value will be 0.
- If it was 0, the next value will be 1.
- If it was 1, the next value will be 2.
- If it was 2, the loop will terminate since the range is exhausted.

Since the last iteration has already occurred for one of these values, we need to determine what the next value of `j` will be. 

If the last value of `j` was 2, the loop will not execute again. In all other cases, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, if `j` was last -2, -1, 0, or 1, we can adjust `j` accordingly for the next iteration.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2; `dy` includes the value `j`; for the loop to execute a second time, if `j` was 2 in the last iteration, it cannot execute again, otherwise `j` is next value in range (-2, 3) which is `j + 1`**.
