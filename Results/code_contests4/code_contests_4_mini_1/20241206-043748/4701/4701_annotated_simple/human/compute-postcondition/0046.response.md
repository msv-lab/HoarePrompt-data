The value of `dx` is modified by appending the value of `i` to it. Since no specific value for `i` is provided, we cannot determine the exact outcome of appending `i`. The initial state mentions that `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, and `j` is -1, but these do not affect the outcome of the `dx.append(i)` operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is -1, and `dx` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is -1, and `dx` now includes the value of `i`.**
