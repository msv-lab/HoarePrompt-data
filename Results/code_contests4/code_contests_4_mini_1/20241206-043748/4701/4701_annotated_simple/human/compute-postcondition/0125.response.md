Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`; `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `H`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `W`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', the execution continues without any changes to the variables.***
