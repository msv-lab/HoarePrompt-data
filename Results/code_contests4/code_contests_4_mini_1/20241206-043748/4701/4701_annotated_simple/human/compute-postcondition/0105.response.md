The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The previous values of `dx` include -2, -1, 1, and 2. After executing the code, `dx` will now include an additional element which is the value of `i`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it, `vvs` includes 1 or has a new element `0` appended to it, and `j` is reset to -2.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it, `vvs` includes 1 or has a new element `0` appended to it, and `j` is reset to -2.**
