According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it will execute for values of `i` equal to -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. The state does not need to be adjusted for `H`, `W`, or any other variables for the loop to execute since the loop's execution is independent of these variables. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is already set to `H`, but for the loop to execute the first time, `i` will be set to -2. 

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `i` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time**
