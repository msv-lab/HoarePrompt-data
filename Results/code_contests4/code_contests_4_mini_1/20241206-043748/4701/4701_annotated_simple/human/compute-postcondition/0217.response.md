Postcondition: ***`num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is updated to `x * w + y`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and is less than or equal to `num`, no changes are made to `seen[u]` and `hp` is not called.***
