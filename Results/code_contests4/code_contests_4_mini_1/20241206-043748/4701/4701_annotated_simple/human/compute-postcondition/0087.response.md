According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2, which is inclusive. This means that the loop will execute a total of 5 times (for j values: -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2). The state of `H`, `W`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` does not directly affect the execution of the loop itself but might be relevant for the loop's logic.

However, for the loop to execute, the variable `j` needs to be initialized appropriately. Since `j` will take on the values from -2 to 2 during the loop, no additional adjustments are necessary for `j` before the loop begins, as it will be assigned its starting value from the range.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, and 2, `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with -2 and `j`, for the loop to execute `j` will take on values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2**
