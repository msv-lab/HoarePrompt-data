The line `seen = [None] * n` initializes a list named `seen` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. The variable `n` has been assigned the value of `H * W`. Therefore, the length of the `seen` list will depend on the values of `H` and `W`, but it will contain only `None` values.

Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state reflects the initialization of the `seen` list.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is updated with `H` input strings, `i` is equal to `H`, `n` is assigned the value of `H * W`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * W + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * W + dw`, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with None values.**
