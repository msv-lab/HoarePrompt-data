The `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped and the next iteration will begin. The values of the variables do not change, but we do not proceed with any further code in the current loop iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains at least one value, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `x` is `ux - 2`, `y` is `uy - 2`, `u` is calculated as `u = (ux - 2) * W + (uy - 2)`, `num` is `pnum + vv`, either `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `H`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `W`, or the value of `ss[x][y]` is `'#'`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
