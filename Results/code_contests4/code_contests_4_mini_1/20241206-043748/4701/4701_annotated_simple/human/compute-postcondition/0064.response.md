`j` is appended to the list `dy`, which already includes -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 based on the conditions. The values of `H`, `W`, `dx`, and `vvs` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i`, `dy` now includes the previous values and the new value `j`, and `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with `i`. 

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i`, `dy` includes -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with `i`.**
