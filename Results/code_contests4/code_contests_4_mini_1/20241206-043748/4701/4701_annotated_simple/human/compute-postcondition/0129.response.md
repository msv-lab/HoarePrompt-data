Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`; `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp(q, (num, u))` is executed. Otherwise, if `seen[u]` is not None and less than or equal to `num`, the variables remain unchanged.***
