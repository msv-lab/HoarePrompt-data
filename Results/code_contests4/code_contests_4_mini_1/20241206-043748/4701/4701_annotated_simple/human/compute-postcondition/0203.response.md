In the provided code snippet, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The initial state indicates that `num` is the sum of `pnum` and the second value of `vvs`, and the details about `vv` being the second value of `vvs` are clear. However, the values of `pnum` and `vv` are not specified in the initial state.

Since `num` is being recalculated with the new assignment, its value will now be the sum of `pnum` and `vv`. The previous value of `num` is overwritten. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `u`) are not affected by this specific line of code, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is now the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, while `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is now the sum of `pnum` and `vv`; `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged.**
