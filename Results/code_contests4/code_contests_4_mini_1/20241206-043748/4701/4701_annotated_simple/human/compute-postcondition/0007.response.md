The value of `cw` is decreased by 1, but the previous value of `cw` is unknown. The other variables `H`, `W`, `dh`, `dw`, and `ch` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer, `dw` is an input integer, `ch` is decreased by 1, and `cw` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer, `dw` is an input integer, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1.**
