Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` may be empty or modified, `seen` reflects the minimum values of `num` for each valid `u` calculated during all iterations, and if the loop terminated due to reaching the `goal`, `pu` will be equal to `goal`. If the loop completed without finding the `goal`, `pu` may be any value related to the last processed element in `q`.`**
