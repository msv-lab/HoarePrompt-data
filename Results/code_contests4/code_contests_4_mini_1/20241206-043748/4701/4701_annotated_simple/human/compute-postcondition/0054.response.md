`dy` is modified by appending the value of `j`, which is currently 0. The values of `H`, `W`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. After execution, `dy` will contain the value 0 appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is 0, and the value 0 is appended to `dy`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is 0, and 0 is appended to `dy`.**
