Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` contains at least one element, `pnum` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`, `pu` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`, `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`, and `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `H`, `y` is greater than or equal to `W`, or the value `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
