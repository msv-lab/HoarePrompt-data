Postcondition: ***`num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`; `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is updated to `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and is less than or equal to `num`, then neither `seen[u]` nor any other variables are modified.***
