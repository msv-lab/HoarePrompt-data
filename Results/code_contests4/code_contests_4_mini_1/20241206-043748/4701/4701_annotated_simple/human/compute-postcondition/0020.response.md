`ss[i]` is assigned the value of `s`. The value of `i` is 1, so `ss[1]` will now hold the value of `s`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than 0, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is updated at index 1 with the value of `s`, `i` is 1, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is updated at index 1 with the value of `s`, `i` is 1, and `s` is an input string.**
