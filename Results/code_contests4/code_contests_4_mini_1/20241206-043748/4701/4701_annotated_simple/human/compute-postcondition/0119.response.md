According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` variables. The loop iterates over the zipped values of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, all three lists (`dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`) must contain at least one element. Given that `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `vvs` contains 0s and 1s based on the conditions provided, it can be inferred that these lists are non-empty and thus allow the loop to execute.

However, to confirm the conditions for the loop execution:
- `dx` has elements (-2, -1, 1, 2), which is non-empty.
- `dy` has elements (-2, -1, 1, 2), which is non-empty.
- `vvs` must also contain corresponding values for each pair of (dx, dy); since it is stated that `vvs` has values for combinations, we can assume it is also non-empty and aligned with `dx` and `dy`.

Thus, the necessary states before the loop starts do not require adjustment since all conditions for execution are satisfied.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`**.
