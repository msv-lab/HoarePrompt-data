According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it can execute a total of 5 times for values of `i`: -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be at its last value, which is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` would need to increment. However, since `i` is already at the upper bound of the range (2), it cannot execute again.

Thus, the states do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop, as the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 based on conditions, and `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with `i`.**
