Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and at least one more value, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and at least one more value, `vvs` contains at least 5 values, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `x` is assigned `ux + xx`, `y` is assigned `uy + yy`, and `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `H`, `y` is greater than or equal to `W`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
