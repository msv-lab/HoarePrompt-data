To determine the output state, we analyze the code snippet provided. 

`ux` and `uy` were calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, which means that `ux` holds the quotient and `uy` holds the remainder of the division of `pu` by `W`. 

Next, `xx` is the first element of `dx`, which is `-2`, and `yy` is the first element of `dy`, which is `-2` as well. 

Now the code snippet updates the values of `x` and `y` as follows:
```
x, y = ux + xx, uy + yy
```
Thus, `x` will be assigned the value of `ux + (-2)` and `y` will be assigned the value of `uy + (-2)`.

The other variables (`H`, `W`, `vvs`, `q`, `pnum`) remain unchanged and their states are unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as:
- `H` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `W` is unchanged.
- `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2.
- `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2.
- `vvs` contains at least one value.
- `q` may be modified and contains at least one element.
- `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`.
- `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`.
- `xx` is -2 (first element of `dx`).
- `yy` is -2 (first element of `dy`).
- `vv` is the first element of `vvs`.

After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` are updated, but without knowing the specific values of `ux` and `uy`, we cannot provide the exact values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains at least one value, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `xx` is -2, `yy` is -2, `x` is `ux - 2`, `y` is `uy - 2`.**
