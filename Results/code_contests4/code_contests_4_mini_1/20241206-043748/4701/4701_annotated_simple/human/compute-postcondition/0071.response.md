According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from -2 to 2, which means it will execute for each value of `j` in that range. At the end of the last iteration, `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, and `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2. 

The loop variable `j` will take on the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 in sequence. If the loop has executed for the last value of `j`, which is 2, then for the next iteration to take place, `j` must be reset to the starting value of the range. However, since the loop will not execute again because `j` will exceed the range limit, there will be no further iterations. 

Therefore, if the loop were to hypothetically execute again, `j` would reset to -2. 

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, and `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be -2.**
