According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the queue `q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, indicating that it is not empty. Therefore, the loop can execute again without any need for adjustments to the states.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`; `u` is calculated as `x * W + y` for all combinations of `xx` and `yy`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.`
