Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `seen` reflects the minimum values of `num` for each valid `u` calculated, `xx` is -2, `yy` is -2, `vv` is the first value from `vvs` for the loop to execute the first time; `x` is calculated as `ux - 2`, `y` is calculated as `uy - 2`.**
