Postcondition: ***`num` is the sum of `pnum` and the first value of `vvs`. `seen[u]` is either None or greater than `num`, and if `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#', then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
