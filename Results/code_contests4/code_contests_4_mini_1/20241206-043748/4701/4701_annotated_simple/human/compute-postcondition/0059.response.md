To analyze the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to consider the range of `j` in the loop and how it interacts with `i`.

The loop runs for `j` values from -2 to 2 (inclusive), resulting in 5 iterations: `j = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2`.

1. **For `j = -2`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to -2 or 0, `dx` will include `i`, and `dy` will include -2. Depending on the value of `i`, `vvs` will be updated based on the sum of the absolute values of `i` and -2.

2. **For `j = -1`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to -1 or 0, `dy` will include -1. Again, `vvs` will be updated based on the sum of the absolute values of `i` and -1.

3. **For `j = 0`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to 0, `dy` will include 0, and `vvs` will be updated based on the absolute values of `i` and 0.

4. **For `j = 1`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to 1 or 0, `dy` will include 1, and `vvs` will be updated based on the sum of the absolute values of `i` and 1.

5. **For `j = 2`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to 2 or 0, `dy` will include 2, and `vvs` will be updated based on the sum of the absolute values of `i` and 2.

After all iterations, we can summarize the output state based on the conditions of `i`:

- If `i` is -2, the `dx` and `dy` arrays will not include any values from the updates during the iterations.
- If `i` is 0, `dy` will include 0 during the iteration for `j = 0`, and no updates will be made for `vvs`.
- If `i` is 1, `dy` will include 1 during the iteration for `j = 1`, and `vvs` will be updated accordingly.
- If `i` is 2, `dy` will include 2 during the iteration for `j = 2`, and `vvs` will be updated accordingly.
- If `i` is neither -2, 0, 1, or 2, `dx` will include `i`, and `dy` will include all `j` values except those equal to `i`, with `vvs` being updated based on the sums for each iteration.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations would consider all these conditions.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 based on conditions, and `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with `i`.**
