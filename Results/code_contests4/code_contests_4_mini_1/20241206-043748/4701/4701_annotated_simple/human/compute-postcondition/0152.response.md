The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
