Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains at least one value, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `x` is `ux - 2`, `y` is `uy - 2`, `u` is calculated as `u = (ux - 2) * W + (uy - 2)`, `num` is `pnum + vv`, if either `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num` and the function `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
