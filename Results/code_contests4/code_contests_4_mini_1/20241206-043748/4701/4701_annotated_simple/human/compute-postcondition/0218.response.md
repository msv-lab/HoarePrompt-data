Output State: **`num` is the sum of `pnum` and the last value in `vvs`, `seen` reflects the minimum values of `num` for each valid `u` calculated during all iterations, and `q` may contain modified elements based on the calls to `hp` with arguments `(num, u)` for valid `u` values. If no valid moves were found, `seen` remains unchanged for those invalid `u` values.**
