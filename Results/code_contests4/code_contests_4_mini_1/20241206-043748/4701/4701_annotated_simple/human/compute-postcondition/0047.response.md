`dy` is a list that now has the value of `j` appended to it. Given that `j` is -1, the list `dy` will include -1 as a new element. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is -1, and `dy` now includes -1.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is -1, `dy` now includes -1**
