Postcondition: ***`num` is the sum of `pnum` and the first value of `vvs`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and less than or equal to `num`, no changes are made to `seen[u]` or the program state.***
