Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j`; `vvs` includes 1 or has a new element `0` appended to it, and `j` is reset to -2. If `i` and `j` are not both zero and the absolute sum of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` includes the elements 1, 1, or 0, 1. Otherwise, `vvs` includes 1 or has a new element `0` appended to it.***
