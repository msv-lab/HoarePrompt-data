The code `vvs.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `vvs`. The previous state indicates that `vvs` includes either the value `1` or has a new element `0` appended to it. Therefore, after executing the given code, `vvs` will definitely include a new `1`, resulting in `vvs` having two `1`s if it previously included `1`, or it will have `0` and `1` if `0` was appended before. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and -2 appended to it, `vvs` includes 1, 1 or 0, 1, and `j` is -2.**
