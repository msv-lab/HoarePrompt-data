`hp(q, (num, u))` is called with the parameters `(num, u)`, where `num` is the value assigned to `seen[u]`. The function `hp` does not change the values of any variables provided in the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`.

Output State: **`seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`**
