The code `vvs.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `vvs`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change as this line only modifies the `vvs` list. The initial state does not mention the current contents of `vvs`, so we assume it exists and can be modified.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is -2, `i` is not equal to -2 or 0; `dx` is updated to include the value of `i`, `dy` is updated to include -2, and the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to 1; `vvs` is updated to include 0.**
