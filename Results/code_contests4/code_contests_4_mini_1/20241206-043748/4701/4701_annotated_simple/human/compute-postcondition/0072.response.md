The value of `dx` has `i` appended to it, assuming `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2. The values of `H` and `W` remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute a second time is provided, but it does not change the state of `H`, `W`, or `dx`. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2.**
