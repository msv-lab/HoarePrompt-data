Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i` appended to it; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it; if the absolute values of `i` and `j` sum to more than 1, then `vvs` includes 1. Otherwise, `vvs` has a new element `0` appended to it; the loop cannot execute again as `j` is 3 and exceeds the range.***
