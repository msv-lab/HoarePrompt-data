Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains at least one value, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `x` is `ux - 2`, `y` is `uy - 2`, `u` is calculated as `u = (ux - 2) * W + (uy - 2)`, `num` is `pnum + vv`, either `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `H`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `W`, or the value of `ss[x][y]` is `'#'`.***
