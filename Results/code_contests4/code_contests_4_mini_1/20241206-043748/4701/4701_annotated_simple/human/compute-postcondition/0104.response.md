According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop runs over a range from -2 to 2, which means it can take on the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, which exceeds the upper limit of 2 for the loop. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more valid values for `j` within the specified range.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be reset to a value within the valid range. The next value that would allow the loop to run again is -2, which is the start of the range.

Additionally, `H`, `W`, `dx`, and `dy` do not need to be modified for this scenario, as they are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i` appended to it; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it; `vvs` includes 1 or has a new element `0` appended to it, for the loop to execute `j` must be reset to -2**
