Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is -2, and if `i` is not equal to -2 or 0, then `dx` is updated to include the value of `i` and `dy` is updated to include -2. If the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` is updated to include the value 1. Otherwise, if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to 1, then `vvs` is updated to include 0. If `i` is equal to -2 or 0, no updates occur.***
