The code `vvs.append(0)` modifies the list `vvs` by appending the value `0` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the modification to `vvs`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i` appended to it; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it; `vvs` has a new element `0` appended to it; the loop cannot execute again as `j` is 3 and exceeds the range.**
