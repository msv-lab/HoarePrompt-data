The value of `dw` is decremented by 1, affecting only the variable `dw`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1.**
