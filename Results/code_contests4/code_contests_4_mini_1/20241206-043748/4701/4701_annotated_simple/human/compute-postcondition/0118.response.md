Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, both `dx` and `dy` do not include 0, `vvs` contains a series of 0s for combinations where `abs(i) + abs(j) <= 1` and 1s for combinations where `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1`, `q` contains at least one element; `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`; `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`; and if `pu` is equal to `goal`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
