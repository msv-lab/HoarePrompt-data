Postcondition: ***`num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is updated to `x * w + y`. If `x` is negative, `y` is negative, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is `'#'`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
