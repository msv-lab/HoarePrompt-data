Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and at least one more value, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and at least one more value, `vvs` contains at least 5 values, `q` may be modified and contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are calculated as `divmod(pu, W)`, `x` is assigned `ux + xx`, `y` is assigned `uy + yy`, and `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(q, (num, u))`. Otherwise, no changes occur in `seen[u]` and the function `hp` is not called.***
