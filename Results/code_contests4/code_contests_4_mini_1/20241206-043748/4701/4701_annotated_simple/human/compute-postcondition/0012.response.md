The code assigns the value `'#'` to the variable `NG`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged, including `H`, `W`, `dh`, `dw`, `ch`, `cw`, `rows`, `cols`, and `OK`. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', and `NG` is assigned the value '#'.

Output State: **`H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#'**.
