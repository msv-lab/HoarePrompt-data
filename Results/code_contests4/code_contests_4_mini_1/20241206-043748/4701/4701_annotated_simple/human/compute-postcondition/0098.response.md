The code `dx.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `dx`. The initial state indicates that `dx` already includes the values -2, -1, 1, 2, and the variable `i` is also present. Since the values of `H`, `W`, `dy`, and `vvs` are not affected by this operation, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated content of `dx` after including `i`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i` appended to it; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `j` appended to it; `vvs` has been modified based on the values of `i` and `j`, but the loop cannot execute again as `j` is 3 and exceeds the range.**
