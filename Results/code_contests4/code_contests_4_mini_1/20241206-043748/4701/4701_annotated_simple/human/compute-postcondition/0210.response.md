The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the calculations involving `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`. Since `x` and `y` are updated to `ux + xx` and `uy + yy` respectively, the values of `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updates to `x` and `y` based on the provided formulas. 

Output State: **`num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` remains unchanged.**
