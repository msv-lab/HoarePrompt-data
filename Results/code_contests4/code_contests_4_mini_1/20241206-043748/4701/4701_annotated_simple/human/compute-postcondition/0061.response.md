According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 inclusive, which means it will execute for the values of `j` being -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. The variables `H`, `W`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are not directly tied to the execution of the loop itself. The loop's execution is determined purely by the range specified.

Since `j` will take on the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 during its iterations, there are no specific adjustments needed for `H`, `W`, `dx`, `dy`, or `vvs` to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, these variables can retain their states as described.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 based on conditions, and `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with `i`, for the loop to execute, `j` will take values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.**
