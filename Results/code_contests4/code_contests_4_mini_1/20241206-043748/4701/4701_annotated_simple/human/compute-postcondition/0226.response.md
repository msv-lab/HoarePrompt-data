The function `func` accepts the following parameters:

- `H`: an integer representing the height of the maze.
- `W`: an integer representing the width of the maze.
- `C_h`: an integer representing the starting height coordinate in the maze.
- `C_w`: an integer representing the starting width coordinate in the maze.
- `D_h`: an integer representing the destination height coordinate in the maze.
- `D_w`: an integer representing the destination width coordinate in the maze.
- `S`: a 2D list of characters where each character is either '#' (indicating a wall) or '.' (indicating a road).

After executing the function body, the function will return different outputs based on the conditions evaluated:

- Case_1: If there is a valid path from the starting coordinates (C_h, C_w) to the destination coordinates (D_h, D_w), it returns `True`.
- Case_2: If there is no valid path from the starting coordinates to the destination coordinates, it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters representing the dimensions and coordinates of a maze, along with the maze structure itself, and determine whether a path exists between the starting and destination points.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters H, W, C_h, C_w, D_h, D_w, and S, and returns `True` if there is a valid path from (C_h, C_w) to (D_h, D_w); otherwise, it returns `False`.**
