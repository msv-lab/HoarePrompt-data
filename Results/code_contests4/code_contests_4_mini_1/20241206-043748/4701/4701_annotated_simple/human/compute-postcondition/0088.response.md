Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, and 2, `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with -2 and `j`, for the loop to execute `j` will take on values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. It is not the case that both `i` and `j` are equal to 0.***
