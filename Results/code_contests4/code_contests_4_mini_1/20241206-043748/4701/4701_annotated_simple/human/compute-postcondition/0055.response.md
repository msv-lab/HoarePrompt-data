The value of `vvs` is appended with the value `1`. Since `H`, `W`, `j`, and `dy` remain unchanged, the output state reflects the new state of `vvs` along with the unchanged variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is 0, 0 is appended to `dy`, and `1` is appended to `vvs`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is 0, 0 is appended to `dy`, and `1` is appended to `vvs`.**
