Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and both `dx` and `dy` do not include 0, `vvs` contains a series of 0s for combinations where `abs(i) + abs(j) <= 1` and 1s for combinations where `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `q` must contain at least one element; `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`.**
