Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and at least one more value, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and at least one more value, `vvs` contains corresponding values and at least one more value, `q` contains at least one element, `pnum` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`, `pu` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`, `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`, `num` is equal to `pnum + vv` for the next iteration, and if `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num` and the function `hp` is called with `q` and the tuple `(num, u)` as arguments.***
