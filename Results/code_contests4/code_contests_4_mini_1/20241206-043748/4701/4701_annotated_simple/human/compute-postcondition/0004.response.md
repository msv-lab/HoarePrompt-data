`ch` and `cw` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()` which are then converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. The initial state indicates that `H` and `W` remain unchanged, and `h` and `w` are already assigned values from the input. Therefore, the values of `ch` and `cw` will depend on the input provided. The output state will reflect that `H` and `W` remain unchanged, while `ch` and `cw` are assigned the input values. 

Output State: **`H` and `W` remain unchanged; `ch` and `cw` are assigned values from input split into integers.**
