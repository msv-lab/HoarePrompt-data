The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement, but it affects the control flow of the program by skipping any remaining code in the current iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is updated to `x * w + y`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is updated to `x * w + y`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
