Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, and `j` is -1. If `i` is not equal to `j` (both not equal to 0), then `dy` includes -1. If the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` includes 1. Otherwise, if the sum is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` includes 0. If `i` is equal to `j` and both are 0, the values of `dy` and `vvs` remain unchanged.***
