Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` contains at least one element, `pnum` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`, `pu` is assigned a value returned by `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`, `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`, and `num` is equal to `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp` is called with the arguments `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and not greater than `num`, no changes are made to `seen[u]`.***
