The variable `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`. The previous values of the affected variables are `dh` (input integer decreased by 1), `dw` (input integer decreased by 1), and `w` (unchanged). Therefore, `goal` is calculated based on these values. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer decreased by 1, `dw` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `H`, `cols` is assigned the value of `W`, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict of sets, `ss` is updated with `H` input strings, `i` is equal to `H`, `n` is assigned the value of `H * W`, `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`.**
