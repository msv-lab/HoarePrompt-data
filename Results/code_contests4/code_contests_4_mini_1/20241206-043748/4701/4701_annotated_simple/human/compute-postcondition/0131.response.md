Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains corresponding values, `q` contains at least one element, `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by `hpp(q)`, `ux` and `uy` are the results of `divmod(pu, W)`; `u` is calculated as `x * W + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `seen[u]` is either None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and `hp(q, (num, u))` is executed; `x` and `y` are updated to `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively.**
