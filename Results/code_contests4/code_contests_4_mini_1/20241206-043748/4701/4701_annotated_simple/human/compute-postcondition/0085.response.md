To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, we analyze the provided code and its effects on the variables.

In the given loop code:
```python
for j in range(-2, 3):
    if not i == j == 0:
        dx.append(i)
        dy.append(j)
        if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1:
            vvs.append(1)
        else:
            vvs.append(0)
```

The loop iterates over the values of `j` from -2 to 2 (inclusive), resulting in 5 iterations: -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.

1. The condition `if not i == j == 0:` ensures that the loop will skip the case where both `i` and `j` are 0. 
2. When `j` takes values -2, -1, 1, or 2 (i.e., all values except 0 when `i` is not 0), it appends `i` to `dx` and `j` to `dy`. 
3. The absolute sum condition `if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1:` determines whether to append 1 or 0 to `vvs`.

Now, let's summarize the output state after all iterations of the loop:

- If `i` is 0, then the loop does not execute any iterations because `j` will be 0 during one of the iterations, and both `i` and `j` cannot be 0 at the same time. Thus, `dx` will remain unchanged, `dy` will be unchanged, and `vvs` will remain unchanged.
- If `i` is not 0, `dx` will contain `i` appended four times (for each of `j` = -2, -1, 1, 2), so `dx` will have `i` four times. `dy` will contain the values -2, -1, 1, and 2. Depending on the absolute sums, `vvs` will have either 1 or 0 appended based on the condition for each `j`.

Conclusively, regardless of the value of `i`, if the loop executes, `dx` will include `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2, `dy` will include -2, -1, 1, and 2 (if `i` is not 0), and `vvs` will contain a series of 1s and 0s based on the conditions evaluated during the loop.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes `i` if `i` is not -2, 0, 1, or 2; `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, and 2 if `i` is not 0; `vvs` includes a series of 0s and 1s based on the absolute sums with `i` and `j`.**
