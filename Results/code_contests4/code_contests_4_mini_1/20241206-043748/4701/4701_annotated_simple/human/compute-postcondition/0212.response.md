The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The initial state indicates that `num` is already the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, but this assignment will reaffirm or update the value of `num` to be the same as before. The states of the other variables `x`, `y`, and `u` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is updated to `x * w + y`.

Output State: **`num` is the sum of `pnum` and `vv`, `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is updated to `x * w + y`.**
