The variable `ch` is decremented by 1. However, the previous value of `ch` is unknown, and since `H`, `W`, `dh`, and `dw` remain unchanged, the output state reflects the change to `ch`. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer, `dw` is an input integer, and `ch` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` is an input integer, `dw` is an input integer, and `ch` is decreased by 1**
