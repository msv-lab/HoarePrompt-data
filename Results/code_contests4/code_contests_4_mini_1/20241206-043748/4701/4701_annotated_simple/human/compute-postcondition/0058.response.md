Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, and `j` is 0. If `i` is not equal to 0, then 0 is appended to `dy`. If the absolute values of `i` and `j` sum to more than 1, then 1 is appended to `vvs`, otherwise, `vvs` contains an additional 0. If `i` equals 0, the if block is not executed, and the state remains unchanged.***
