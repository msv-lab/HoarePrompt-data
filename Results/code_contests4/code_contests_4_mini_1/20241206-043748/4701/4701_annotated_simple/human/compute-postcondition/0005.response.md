The code snippet assigns values to `dh` and `dw` by mapping the `input` values split into integers. The variables `H` and `W` remain unchanged, while `ch` and `cw` are assigned values from input but their previous values are not mentioned here. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` and `dw` are assigned the input integer values.

Output State: **`H` is unchanged, `W` is unchanged, `dh` and `dw` are assigned the input integer values**
