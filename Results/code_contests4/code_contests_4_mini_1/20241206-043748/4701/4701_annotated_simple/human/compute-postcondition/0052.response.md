According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means the values of `j` will take on the values -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` will be incremented to 0 for the next iteration. 

The conditions mentioned indicate that:
- `H` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `W` is unchanged.
- The value of `i` is not equal to `j` (both not equal to 0).
- Therefore, `dy` will include -1 since `i` is not equal to -1.
- The sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` will be calculated as well. Since `j` will be 0 in the next iteration, the sum will depend on the value of `i`. 

Since `j` is going to be 0 in the next iteration, we need to consider that `i` is not equal to `j` (j=0), and thus `dy` will still include -1. The condition regarding `vvs` must be evaluated based on the absolute values, but we don't have the specific value of `i`. However, we recognize that the loop is set to execute and the states will adjust correspondingly.

State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must not equal 0.**
