The code defines a lambda function `write` that takes a string `x` as input and writes it to standard output followed by a newline character. This does not affect any of the variables `H`, `W`, `C_h`, `C_w`, `D_h`, `D_w`, or `S`, nor does it change the recursion limit. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the initial values of the variables.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers representing the height and width of the maze; `C_h`, `C_w`, `D_h`, and `D_w` are integers representing the starting and destination coordinates; `S` is a 2D list of characters indicating walls and roads; the recursion limit is set to the maximum of 1000 and 10^9; a lambda function `write` has been defined.**
