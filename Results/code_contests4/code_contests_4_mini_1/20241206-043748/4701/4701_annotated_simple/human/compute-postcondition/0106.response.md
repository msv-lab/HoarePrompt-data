The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`. Since `j` is reset to -2, this means that -2 will be added as a new element to the list `dy`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and -2 appended to it, `vvs` includes 1 or has a new element `0` appended to it, and `j` is -2.

Output State: **`H` is greater than or equal to 0, `W` is unchanged, `dx` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and `i`, `dy` includes -2, -1, 1, 2, and -2 appended to it, `vvs` includes 1 or has a new element `0` appended to it, and `j` is -2.**
