H and W are integers representing the height and width of the maze (1 ≤ H, W ≤ 1000). C_h, C_w, D_h, and D_w are integers representing the starting and destination coordinates (1 ≤ C_h, D_h ≤ H, 1 ≤ C_w, D_w ≤ W). S is a 2D list of characters where each character is either '#' or '.' indicating walls and roads, respectively, and S[C_h][C_w] and S[D_h][D_w] are guaranteed to be '.' with (C_h, C_w) ≠ (D_h, D_w).
