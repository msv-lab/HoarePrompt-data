The function accepts integers representing the height and width of a maze, the starting position of a magician, the destination position, and a 2D list representing the maze grid. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed for the magician to reach the destination from the starting position, considering movement through open paths ('.') and avoiding walls ('#'). If no valid path exists, it returns -1.
