The variable `dx` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The previous values of `dx` include five entries of -2 and `i`, which means the new entry will be added to the end of the existing list. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include five entries of -2 and `i`, `dy` is [-2, -1, 1, 2, j], `vvs` is [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] if `i` and `j` are both equal to 0, otherwise `vvs` is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and `i` is appended to `dx`.
