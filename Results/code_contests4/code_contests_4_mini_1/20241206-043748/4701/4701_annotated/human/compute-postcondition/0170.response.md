Postcondition: ***`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; `seen` array remains unchanged unless `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, in which case `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is updated to `pnum + vv`, and if `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` equals '#', we continue to the next iteration without changing any variable states.***
