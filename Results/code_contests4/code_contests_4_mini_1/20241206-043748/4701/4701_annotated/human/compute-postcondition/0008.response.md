`dh` is decremented by 1, affecting its previous value, which is an input integer. The values of `h`, `w`, `ch`, and `cw` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is an input integer.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is an input integer**
