The variable `u` is assigned the value of the expression `x * w + y`. The values of `x` and `y` are given as `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively. However, the value of `w` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot compute a definitive value for `u`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y` (where `w` is unknown).**
