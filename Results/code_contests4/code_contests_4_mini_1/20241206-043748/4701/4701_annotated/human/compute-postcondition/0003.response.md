The values of `H` and `W` are assigned to `h` and `w` respectively by using the `map` function to convert the input from a string to integers. The specific values of `H` and `W` are not provided, so the output state will reflect that `h` and `w` are assigned the values of `H` and `W`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`**
