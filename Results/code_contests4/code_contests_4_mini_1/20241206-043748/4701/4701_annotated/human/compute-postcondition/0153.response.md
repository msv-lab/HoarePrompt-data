Postcondition: ***`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; `seen` array is unchanged; `ux` and `uy` are assigned the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, respectively. If `pu` equals `goal`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
