The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is determined by `(ux + xx) * w + (uy + yy)`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
