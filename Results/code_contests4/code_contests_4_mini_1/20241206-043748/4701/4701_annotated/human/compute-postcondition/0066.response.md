`vvs` is updated by appending the value `1` to the existing list `vvs`, which previously contained four entries of `1`. After this operation, `vvs` will now contain five entries of `1` followed by one additional `1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include five entries of -2 and `i`, `dy` is [-2, -1, 1, 2, j], and `vvs` is now [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
