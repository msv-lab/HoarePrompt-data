Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings (if `H` is equal to `rows`), and any remaining elements are `None` (if `H` is greater than `rows`); `n` is `H * W`; `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1); `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2; `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0; `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start); `dx` is an empty list.**
