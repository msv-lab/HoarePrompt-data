The variables `ch` and `cw` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `h` and `w` are not affected by this operation, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `h` and `w`, as well as the new assignments to `ch` and `cw` based on the input values.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer, `cw` is an input integer**
