According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it can execute for the values of `j` as -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently -2. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to -1. 

The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be -1.

State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include `i`, `dy` is now [-2], and `vvs` is updated to include 1 if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, or [0] if it is less than or equal to 1, with `j` being -1 for the next iteration.**
