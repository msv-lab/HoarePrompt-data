The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `num` remains the same since it's being assigned `pnum + vv` again, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `num` remains the same since it's being assigned `pnum + vv` again, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
