`n` is assigned the value of `rows * cols`. The values of `rows` and `cols` are `H` and `W`, respectively. Therefore, `n` will be `H * W`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings (if `H` is equal to `rows`), and any remaining elements are `None` (if `H` is greater than `rows`); `n` is `H * W`.**
