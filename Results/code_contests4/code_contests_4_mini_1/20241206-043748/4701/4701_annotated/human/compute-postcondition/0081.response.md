The code `vvs.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `vvs`. The previous state of `vvs` can either be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]` if `i` and `j` are both equal to 0, or it will have been updated to include `0` otherwise. However, without additional information on the exact current state of `vvs`, we can only mention that it's being appended with `1`.

Since the other variables remain unchanged, the Output State reflects the addition to the list.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `vvs` now includes an additional `1`**
