Postcondition: ***`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; the `seen` array is unchanged; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is `pnum + vv`; if `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or the value at `ss[x][y]` is '#', then the program will continue to the next iteration or statement without making any changes to the variables.***
