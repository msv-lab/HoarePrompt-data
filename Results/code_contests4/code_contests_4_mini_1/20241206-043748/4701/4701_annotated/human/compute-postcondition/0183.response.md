Output State: **`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; `seen` is an array updated with the minimum values based on the conditions; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` and `y` are the final calculated values based on the last iterations of `xx` and `yy`; `u` is the last calculated value as `x * w + y`; `num` is the last calculated value as `pnum + vv`; if any `seen[u]` was None or greater than `num` during the iterations, it was updated accordingly, and `hp` was called with the final parameters `(num, u)`.**
