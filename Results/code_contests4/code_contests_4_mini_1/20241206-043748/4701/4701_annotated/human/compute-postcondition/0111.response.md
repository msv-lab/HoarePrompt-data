To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop operates. The loop iterates over `j` values from -2 to 2 (inclusive), excluding the case where both `i` and `j` are zero. 

1. The loop will execute a total of 5 times (for j = -2, -1, 1, 2, and 0 is skipped).
2. In each iteration:
   - If both `i` and `j` are not equal to zero, the value of `i` is appended to `dx` and the current value of `j` is appended to `dy`.
   - The `vvs` list is updated based on the condition of the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j`.
3. The variables `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, and `dw` are decremented by 1 if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is greater than 1.

After all iterations have executed:
- The values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged as `H` and `W`, respectively.
- The `dx` list will contain the value of `i` appended 5 times (assuming `i` is not 0).
- The `dy` list will contain the values -2, -1, 1, and 2 from the iterations.
- The `vvs` list will contain an additional 5 entries based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration, either 1 or 0 depending on the relationship of `i` and `j`.
- The values of `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, and `dw` will be decremented a number of times based on how many iterations had `abs(i) + abs(j) > 1`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is as follows:

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `dx` includes five entries of `i`, `dy` contains -2, -1, 1, 2, `vvs` contains five additional elements based on conditions of `i` and `j`, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, and `dw` are decremented accordingly.**
