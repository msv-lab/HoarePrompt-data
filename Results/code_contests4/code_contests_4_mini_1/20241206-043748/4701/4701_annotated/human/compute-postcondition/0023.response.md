The statement `ss[i] = s` assigns the value of `s` to the index `i` of the list `ss`. The value of `i` is currently 2, so the element at index 2 of `ss` will now hold the value of `s`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `i` is 2, `s` is input string, and `ss[2]` is assigned the value of `s`.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `i` is 2, `s` is input string, `ss[2]` is assigned the value of `s`.**
