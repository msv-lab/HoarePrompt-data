The code `vvs.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `vvs`. The previous state of `vvs` is not specified, but it contains six elements, and the append operation adds an additional element to the list. Therefore, the effect of this operation is that `vvs` now contains seven elements.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` includes five entries: -2, -2, -2, -2, and `i` and now contains an additional entry `i`, `dy` includes values from -2 to 2 except for 0 with additional entries based on `j`, `vvs` contains seven elements where the first six depend on the conditions of `i` and `j`, and it holds true that `i` is not equal to `j` and both are not equal to 0, `dy` is updated to include the value of `j`, and the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1.**
