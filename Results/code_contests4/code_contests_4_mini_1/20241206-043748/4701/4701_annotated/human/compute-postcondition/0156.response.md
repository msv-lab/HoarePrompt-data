The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The values of the affected variables are as follows: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, and `w` is a known value. The previous values of `ux` and `uy` are derived from the division of `pu` by `w` and its remainder, respectively. Therefore, `u` will be computed based on these relationships.

After executing the code, the output state is: `pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; `seen` array is unchanged; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`.
