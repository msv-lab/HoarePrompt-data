The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous value of `pnum` is known (the first value returned from `hpp(q)`), and the value of `vv` is assumed to be known as well. Therefore, after execution of the code, `num` will hold the result of the addition of `pnum` and `vv`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; `seen` array is unchanged; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is `pnum + vv`.**
