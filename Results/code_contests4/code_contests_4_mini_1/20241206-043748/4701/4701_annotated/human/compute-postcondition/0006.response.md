The value of `ch` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `ch` is unknown as it is derived from user input. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer; `dh` and `dw` are input integers.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer; `dh` and `dw` are input integers.**
