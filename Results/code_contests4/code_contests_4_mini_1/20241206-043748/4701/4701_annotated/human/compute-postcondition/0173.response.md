Postcondition: ***`pnum`, `pu`, `seen`, `ux`, `uy`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, and `vv` are defined as per the precondition. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, `seen[u]` is updated to `num` and `hp` is called with parameters `(num, u)`. If `seen[u]` is not None and not greater than `num`, no changes are made to any variables.***
