The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is `ux + xx` and `y` is `uy + yy`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
