The code `vvs.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `vvs`. The previous state of `vvs` is either `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]` if both `i` and `j` are 0 or `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` if they are not. In either case, the list will now include an additional element, `0`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `vvs` has been updated to include `0`.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include five entries of -2 and `i`, `dy` is [-2, -1, 1, 2, j, j], `vvs` is now updated to include `0`.**
