The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The values of `x` and `y` are given as `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively. The variable `w` is not defined in the initial state, so its value remains unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `u` is determined by the formula involving `x`, `y`, and `w`, but we cannot compute a specific value for `u`.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is determined by the formula `u = (ux + xx) * w + (uy + yy)` where `w` is unknown.**
