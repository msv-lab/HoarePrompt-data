The code `dy.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `dy`. The variables `h`, `w`, and `dx` are not affected by this operation. The initial values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged, and the state of `dx` also remains unchanged as it is not mentioned to be modified in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, and `dx` has `i` appended to it; `dy` now contains the value of `j` appended to it.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `dx` has `i` appended to it; `dy` now contains the value of `j` appended to it.**
