The code `vvs.append(1)` appends the value 1 to the list `vvs`. Since `vvs` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can infer that its previous state is not defined. The values of `h`, `w`, `j`, and `dy` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `j` is 2, `dy` contains the value 2, and `vvs` now includes the value 1 appended to it.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `j` is 2, `dy` contains the value 2, and `vvs` now includes the value 1 appended to it.**
