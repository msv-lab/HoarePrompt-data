Postcondition: ***`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `num` remains the same since it's being assigned `pnum + vv` again. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop based on the conditions that `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` equals '#', and assigns `seen[u]` the value of `num`; the function `hp` is called with parameters `(num, u)`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
