Output State: **`seen` is updated for all valid values of `u`, `u` is the final computed value of `x * w + y` for the last valid `x` and `y`, `num` is the accumulated value of `pnum + vv` for the last valid iteration, `x` is the final computed value of `ux + xx`, and `y` is the final computed value of `uy + yy`. If the loop did not execute, `seen` remains unchanged, and `u`, `num`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values.**
