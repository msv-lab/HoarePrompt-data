The value of `dx` is updated by appending the current value of `i` to it. The previous entries in `dx` include five instances of -2 and the variable `i`, which remains unchanged. The output state reflects this change without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include five entries of -2 and the new value of `i`, `dy` is [-2, -1, 1, 2, j, j], and `vvs` is either [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1] if `i` and `j` are both equal to 0, or updated to include `0` otherwise, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than 3; `dx` now includes `i`.**
