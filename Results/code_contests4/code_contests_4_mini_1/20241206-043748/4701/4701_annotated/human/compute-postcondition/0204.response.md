The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
