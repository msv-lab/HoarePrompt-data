Postcondition: ***`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; the `seen` array remains unchanged unless `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, in which case `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is `pnum + vv`; if `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, `hp(q, (num, u))` is executed.`**
