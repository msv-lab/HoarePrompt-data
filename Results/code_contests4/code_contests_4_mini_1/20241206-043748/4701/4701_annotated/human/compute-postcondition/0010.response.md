`rows` is assigned the value of `h`, which is `H`, and `cols` is assigned the value of `w`, which is `W`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, and `dw` is decremented by 1; `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`. 

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1; `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`**
