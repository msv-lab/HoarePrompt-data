The variable `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are not provided, so the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.

Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
