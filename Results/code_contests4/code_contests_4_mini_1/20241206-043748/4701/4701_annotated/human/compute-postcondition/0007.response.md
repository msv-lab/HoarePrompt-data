The value of `cw` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cw` is an input integer, so the new value of `cw` is `cw - 1`. The other variables `h`, `w`, `ch`, `dh`, and `dw` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer, and `dw` is an input integer.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer, `dw` is an input integer**
