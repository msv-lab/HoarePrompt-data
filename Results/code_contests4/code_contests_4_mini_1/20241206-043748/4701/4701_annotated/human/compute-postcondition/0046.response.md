The value of `dx` is updated to include the value of `i`. The previous values of `dx` are not specified, but `i` is appended to the existing list. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dx` has changed, but the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include `i`, `dy` is now [-2], `vvs` is updated to include 1 if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, or [0] if it is less than or equal to 1, with `j` being -1 for the next iteration, and `dx` now includes `i`.**
