Output State: **`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; `seen` array is unchanged; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`; `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`; `num` is `pnum + vv`; `seen[u]` is now assigned the value `num`.**
