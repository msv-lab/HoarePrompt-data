The variable `start` is assigned the value of `ch * w + cw`. Given the initial state, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `w` is `W`, and `cw` is also an input integer decremented by 1. Therefore, `start` will be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate `ch * w`: Since `ch` is decremented by 1, we can denote it as (input integer - 1) * W.
2. Calculate `cw`: This is simply the input integer decremented by 1.

Thus, the final value of `start` will be: 
- start = ((input integer - 1) * W) + (input integer - 1)

The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings (if `H` is equal to `rows`), and any remaining elements are `None` (if `H` is greater than `rows`); `n` is `H * W`; `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1)**
