The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. To evaluate `u`, we need to consider the values of `x`, `y`, and `w`. 

Given:
- `x` is `ux + xx`
- `y` is `uy + yy`
- `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`
- `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`
- `xx` is the first element of `dx`
- `yy` is the first element of `dy`

Since `u` is calculated based on `x` and `y`, which both depend on `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy`, the output state will summarize these relationships without assigning specific values since they are not provided.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`.
Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`**
