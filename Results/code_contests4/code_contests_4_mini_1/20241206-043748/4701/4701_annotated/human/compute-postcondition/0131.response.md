The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the previous states of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`. The initial values of `x` and `y` were `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`, respectively. After executing the code, `x` now becomes `ux + xx` (which remains the same, as it is being reassigned to the same expression), and `y` becomes `uy + yy`, which also remains unchanged. Therefore, the values of the variables `x` and `y` do not change.

The output state reflects that `x` and `y` retain their initial values based on the expressions assigned to them.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`**
