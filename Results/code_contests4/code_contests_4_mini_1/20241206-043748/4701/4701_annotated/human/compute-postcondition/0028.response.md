The variable `seen` is assigned a list containing `n` elements, all initialized to `None`. The value of `n` is `H * W`, which means the length of the `seen` list will depend on the product of `H` and `W`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings (if `H` is equal to `rows`), and any remaining elements are `None` (if `H` is greater than `rows`); `n` is `H * W`; `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1); `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2; `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`.**
