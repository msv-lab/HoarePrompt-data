Postcondition: ***`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, `dw` are decremented by 1. The variables `rows` and `cols` remain as `H` and `W` respectively. The list `ss` contains `H` input strings, and `n` is equal to `H * W`. The variable `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), and `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2`. The list `seen` is initialized with `None` and `seen[start]` is now 0. The list `q` contains the tuple (0, start), and `dx` is updated to include `i`. The list `dy` is updated to include -2 and -1. The variable `vvs` is updated to include 1 if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, or 0 if it is less than or equal to 1.***
