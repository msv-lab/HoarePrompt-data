The statement `dx.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `dx`. However, since there's no information provided about the current state of `dx` or the value of `i`, we cannot determine the specific change to `dx`. Additionally, the loop cannot execute again as `j` is already at its maximum value of 2. Therefore, the values of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `j` is 2, and `dx` remains unchanged while `i` is added to `dx` if it exists.**
