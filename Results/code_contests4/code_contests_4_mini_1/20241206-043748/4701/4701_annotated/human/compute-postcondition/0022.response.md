The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `i` is 2, and `s` is input string.**
