Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings (if `H` is equal to `rows`), `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now updated to include `i`, `dy` is an empty list, `vvs` is an empty list, `j` is -2 for the loop to execute the first time, and it is guaranteed that `i` is not equal to `j` and `i` is not equal to 0.**
