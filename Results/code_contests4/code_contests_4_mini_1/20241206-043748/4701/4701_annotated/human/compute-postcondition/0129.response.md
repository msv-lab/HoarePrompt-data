Postcondition: ***`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is now set to `num`, and the function `hp` is called with parameters `(num, u)`; otherwise, there is no change to `seen[u]` and the function does not execute.***
