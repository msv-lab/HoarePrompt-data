The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and either `x` is less than 0, or `y` is less than 0, or `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or the element `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
