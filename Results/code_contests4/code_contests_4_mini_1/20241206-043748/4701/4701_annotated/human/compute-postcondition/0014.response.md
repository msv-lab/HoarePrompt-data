`ss` is assigned a list of length equal to `rows`, which is `H`. Each element in the list is initialized to `None`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1; `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`; `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#'; `ns` is a defaultdict of sets; `ss` is a list of length `H` initialized with `None`.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1; `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`; `OK` is '.', `NG` is '#'; `ns` is a defaultdict of sets; `ss` is a list of length `H` initialized with `None`.**
