Postcondition: ***`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, then `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, and `dw` are each decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` includes five entries: -2, -2, -2, -2, and `i`, `dy` includes values from -2 to 2 except for 0 with additional entries based on `j`, and `vvs` contains seven elements where the first six depend on the conditions of `i` and `j`, and `dy` is updated to include the value of `j`. Otherwise, if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to 1, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, and `dw` are each decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` includes five entries: -2, -2, -2, -2, and `i`, `dy` includes values from -2 to 2 except for 0 with additional entries based on `j`, and `vvs` now contains one additional element which is 0.***
