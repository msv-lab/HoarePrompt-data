Postcondition: ***`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, where `x` is `ux + xx` and `y` is `uy + yy`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
