The variables `ux` and `uy` are used to calculate new values for `x` and `y`. Specifically, `x` is assigned the value of `ux + xx` and `y` is assigned the value of `uy + yy`. The initial values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are necessary to determine the new values of `x` and `y`. 

Since `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, and `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, we proceed to compute `x` and `y`.

Assuming the values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are known from the initial state:

- `x` will be `ux + xx`
- `y` will be `uy + yy`

As no specific numeric values are provided in the initial state, the output state will reflect the relationship with the variables involved.

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`, `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, `xx` is the first element of `dx`, `yy` is the first element of `dy`**.
