The variables `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` are combined through addition to calculate the new values of `x` and `y`. Specifically, `x` is assigned the value of `ux + xx`, and `y` is assigned the value of `uy + yy`. The previous values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` are known, but the specific numeric results depend on these values.

Output State: **`pnum` is the first value returned from `hpp(q)`; `pu` is the second value returned from `hpp(q)`; `seen` array is unchanged; `ux` is the quotient of `pu` divided by `w`; `uy` is the remainder of `pu` divided by `w`; `x` is `ux + xx`; `y` is `uy + yy`.**
