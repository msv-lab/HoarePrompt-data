`dh` and `dw` are assigned values from the input, which is accepted as a space-separated string and then converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `h`, `w`, `ch`, and `cw` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer, `cw` is an input integer; `dh` and `dw` are input integers derived from user input.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer, `cw` is an input integer; `dh` and `dw` are input integers derived from user input.**
