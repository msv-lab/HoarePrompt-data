The variable `dy` is updated to append the value of `j`, but the previous values of `dy` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dy` has been modified to include the new value `j`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, `dw` are decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is equal to `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is 0, `q` contains (0, start), `dx` updated to include `i`, `dy` now includes `j`, `vvs` updated to include 1 or 0 based on the condition; the loop cannot execute again as the range has been exhausted, and `dx` is updated to append `i`.**
