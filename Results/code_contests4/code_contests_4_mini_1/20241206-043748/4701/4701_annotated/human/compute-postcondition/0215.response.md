Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`; `x` is updated to `ux + xx`; `y` is updated to `uy + yy`; `num` remains the same since it's being assigned `pnum + vv` again; the program skips to the next iteration of the loop based on the conditions; `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`.**
