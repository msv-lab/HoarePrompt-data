The value of `ss[i]` is assigned the value of `s`. The previous value of `s` is updated with a new input string, so `ss[i]` will now hold this new input string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, and `ss[i]` is assigned the value of the new input string.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, and `ss[i]` is assigned the value of the new input string.**
