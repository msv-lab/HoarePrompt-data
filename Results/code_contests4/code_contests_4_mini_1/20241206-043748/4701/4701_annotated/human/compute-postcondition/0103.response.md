Postcondition: ***`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, and for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to 2. If `i` is not equal to `j` and both are not zero, `dx` has `i` appended to it, and `dy` contains the value of `j` appended to it. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, then `vvs` has 1 appended to it; otherwise, `vvs` has 0 appended to it.***
