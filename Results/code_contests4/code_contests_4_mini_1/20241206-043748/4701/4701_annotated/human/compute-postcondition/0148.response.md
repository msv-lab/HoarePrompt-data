Output State: **`x` is `ux + dx[i]` for the last iteration, `y` is `uy + dy[i]` for the last iteration, `u` is `x * w + y`, `num` is the final value of `pnum + vvs[i]` for the last iteration. The `seen` array will have been updated such that `seen[u]` is the minimum `num` for which it was assigned, and the function `hp` will have been called for each unique `u` that was considered valid.**
