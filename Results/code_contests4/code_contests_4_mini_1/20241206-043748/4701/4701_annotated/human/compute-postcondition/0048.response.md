The code `vvs.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `vvs`. The previous state of `vvs` is not mentioned, but it is updated to include the new value `1`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `1` to the list.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include `i`, `dy` is now `[-2, -1]`, `vvs` is updated to include 1, and `1` is appended to `vvs`.**
