The code `vvs.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `vvs`. Since no information about the initial state or previous values of `vvs` is provided, we cannot determine its previous content. However, we can confirm that `0` has been added to `vvs`. The values of `h`, `w`, `j`, and `dy` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `j` is 2, `dy` contains the value 2, and `vvs` now contains the value 0 appended to it.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `j` is 2, `dy` contains the value 2, and `vvs` now contains the value 0 appended to it.**
