Postcondition: ***`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is determined by `(ux + xx) * w + (uy + yy)`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `(num, u)`.***
