The code appends the integer value `0` to the list `vvs`. Since `vvs` is initially an empty list, after execution, `vvs` will contain the single element `0`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is now updated to include `i`, `dy` is now [-2], `vvs` is [0], `j` is -2. The absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1.

The absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1.**
