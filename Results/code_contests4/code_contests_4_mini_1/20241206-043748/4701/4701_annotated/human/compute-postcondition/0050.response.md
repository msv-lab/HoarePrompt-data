Postcondition: ***`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, `dw` are decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include `i`, `dy` is now `[-2, -1]`, `vvs` is updated to include 1 if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, or 0 if it is less than or equal to 1.***
