According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `rows`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `rows` is `H`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `rows`. Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1 to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `rows` must be greater than 2.

State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `rows` must be greater than 2**
