The code assigns new values to `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is calculated as `ux + xx`, and the value of `y` is calculated as `uy + yy`. Other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated values of `x` and `y` based on the initial values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`. 

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`**
