To evaluate the effect of the code snippet, we first analyze the initial state of the variables:

- `h` is `H`
- `w` is `W`
- `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1
- `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1
- `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1
- `dw` is decremented by 1
- `rows` is `H`
- `cols` is `W`
- `ss` contains `H` input strings if `H` is equal to `rows`; otherwise, remaining elements are `None`
- `n` is `H * W`
- `start` is calculated as `(input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1)`

Now, let's focus on the code snippet:
```
goal = dh * w + dw
```

1. `goal` is assigned the value of `dh * w + dw`.
2. The value of `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1.
3. The value of `w` is `W`.
4. The value of `dw` is decremented by 1.

We calculate `goal`:
- Let `dh = input integer - 1` (denote this as `dh`).
- Let `dw = input integer - 1 - 1 = input integer - 2` (denote this as `dw`).

Thus, substituting in the equation:
```
goal = (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2)
```

This means `goal` depends on the input integer and `W`.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings (if `H` is equal to `rows`), and any remaining elements are `None` (if `H` is greater than `rows`); `n` is `H * W`; `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1); `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2**.
