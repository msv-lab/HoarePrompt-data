According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `rows`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `rows` is `H`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `rows` must be greater than `1`.

State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, and `ss[i]` is assigned the value of `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `rows` must be greater than 1.**
