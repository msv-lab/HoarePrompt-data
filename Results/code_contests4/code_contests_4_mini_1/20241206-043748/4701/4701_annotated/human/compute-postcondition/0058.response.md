Postcondition: ***`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, `dw` are decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is equal to `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is 0, `q` contains (0, start), `dx` updated to include `i`, `dy` now includes `j`, and `vvs` is updated to include 1 or 0 based on the condition; if the sum of the absolute values of `i` and `j` exceeds 1, `vvs` has a new entry of 1. Otherwise, `0` is appended to `vvs` and the loop cannot execute again as the range has been exhausted. If `i` and `j` are both not equal to 0, the aforementioned updates and conditions are applied accordingly.***
