Postcondition: ***`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, where `x` is `ux + xx` and `y` is `uy + yy`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', the values of the variables do not change and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
