The variable `dx` is being appended with the value of `i`. The values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The loop condition indicates that `j` must be less than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again, but it does not affect the current operation. Therefore, I will assume `i` has a specific value that is being appended to `dx`. 

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, and `dx` has `i` appended to it**.
