Postcondition: ***`u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, where `x` is `ux + xx` and `y` is `uy + yy`; `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
