The code snippet appends the value `1` to the list `vvs`. The previous value of `vvs` is either `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]` if `i` and `j` are both equal to 0, or `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` if they are not. Therefore, after executing `vvs.append(1)`, `vvs` will have one additional `1` added to it.

Since we do not have specific values for `i` and `j`, we cannot determine the exact previous state of `vvs`. Thus, the output state will mention both possible scenarios.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `dh` is decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, `ss` contains `H` input strings, `n` is `H * W`, `start` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 1), `goal` is calculated as (input integer - 1) * W + (input integer - 2, `seen` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`, `seen[start]` is now 0, `q` is a list containing the tuple (0, start), `dx` is updated to include five entries of -2 and `i`, `dy` is [-2, -1, 1, 2, j, j], `vvs` is either [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1] if `i` and `j` are both equal to 0, or [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] otherwise.**
