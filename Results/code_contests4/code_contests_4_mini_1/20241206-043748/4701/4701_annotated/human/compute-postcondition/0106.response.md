The code `dy.append(j)` appends the value of `j`, which is 2, to the list `dy`. The initial values of `h`, `w`, `dx`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `j` is 2, and `dy` now contains the value 2 appended to it.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `j` is 2, and `dy` now contains the value 2 appended to it.**
