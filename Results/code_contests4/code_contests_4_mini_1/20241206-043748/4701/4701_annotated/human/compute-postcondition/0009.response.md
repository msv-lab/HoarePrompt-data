The value of `dw` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `dw` is an input integer, but since we don't have the specific value, we cannot determine the exact result of `dw`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, and `dw` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is an input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is an input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is an input integer decremented by 1, and `dw` is decremented by 1.**
