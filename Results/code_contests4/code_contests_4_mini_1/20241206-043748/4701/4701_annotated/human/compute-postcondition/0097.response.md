According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -2 to 2 (inclusive), which means it will execute for the values of `j` equal to -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. If the loop has completed its last iteration with `j` being 2, it will not execute again since the next value of `j` would be 3, which is outside the specified range.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `h` as `H` and `w` as `W`. The loop has just finished with `j` equal to 2, and the loop will not execute again since the range has been exhausted. Therefore, there are no adjustments to be made to the states as the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to 2**
