The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in, if applicable. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, and `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`x` is `ux + xx`, `y` is `uy + yy`, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
