According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `rows`, which is initialized to `H`. The loop will execute `H` times, starting with `i` at 0 and incrementing up to `H-1`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `H` must be greater than 0. The values of `h`, `w`, `ch`, `cw`, `dh`, `dw`, `cols`, `OK`, `NG`, `ns`, and `ss` do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute, but we need to set `i` to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`h` is `H`, `w` is `W`, `ch` is input integer decremented by 1, `cw` is input integer decremented by 1, `dh` is input integer decremented by 1, `dw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is `H`, `cols` is `W`, for the loop to execute the first time `rows` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
