#State of the program right berfore the function call: H and W are integers representing the height and width of the maze grid, respectively, both between 1 and 1000; C_h and C_w are integers representing the starting position of the magician in the grid, with both values between 1 and H or W, respectively; D_h and D_w are integers representing the destination position in the grid, also between 1 and H or W; S is a 2D list of characters where each character is either '#' (a wall) or '.' (a road), and S[C_h][C_w] and S[D_h][D_w] are guaranteed to be '.'; (C_h, C_w) is not equal to (D_h, D_w).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers representing the height and width of a maze, the starting position of a magician, the destination position, and a 2D list representing the maze grid. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed for the magician to reach the destination from the starting position, considering movement through open paths ('.') and avoiding walls ('#'). If no valid path exists, it returns -1.
