The code contains a print statement, which outputs the value `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as there are no assignments or modifications made to them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers; print outputs 1**
