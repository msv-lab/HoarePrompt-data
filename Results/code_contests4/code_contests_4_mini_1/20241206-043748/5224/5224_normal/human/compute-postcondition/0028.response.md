The code prints the value `-2`, which does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The variables maintain their previous values, and the output simply reflects the printed value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`, and the printed value is `-2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`, and the printed value is `-2`.**
