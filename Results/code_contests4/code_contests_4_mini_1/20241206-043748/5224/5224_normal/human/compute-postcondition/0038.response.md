The code snippet `print(1)` outputs the value `1` to the console. The variables `n`, `i`, and `d` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state captures the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is assigned the value (xa - xb), and 1 has been printed.**
