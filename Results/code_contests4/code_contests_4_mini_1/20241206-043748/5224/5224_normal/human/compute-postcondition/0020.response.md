Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, and `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, then 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `d` is less than or equal to the square of the sum of `ra` and `rb`, and if `ra` is greater than `rb`, then if the square of the difference (ra - rb) is greater than `d`, the output is 2; otherwise, the output is 1. If `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`, then if the square of the difference (rb - ra) is greater than `d`, -2 is printed; otherwise, if it is not the case that (rb - ra) is greater than `d`, the output will depend on the condition not being satisfied.***
