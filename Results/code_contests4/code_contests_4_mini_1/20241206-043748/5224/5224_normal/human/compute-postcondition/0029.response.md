The code executes a print statement that outputs the value `1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`, and we print `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`, and we print `1`.**
