The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the integer `1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `(xa - xb)`, and the value `1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `(xa - xb)`, and the value `1` has been printed.**
