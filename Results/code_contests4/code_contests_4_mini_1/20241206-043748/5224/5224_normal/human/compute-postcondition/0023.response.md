The variable `d` is assigned the value of the expression `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are input integers, which means they can be any integers provided by the user. The initial values of `n` and `i` are not impacted by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, and `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, and `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`.**
