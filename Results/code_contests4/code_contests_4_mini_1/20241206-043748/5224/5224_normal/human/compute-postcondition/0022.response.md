The code assigns values to the variables `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, and `rb` using the `map` function to convert input from `raw_input` into integers. The values for these variables are taken from a single line of input, which means they will be assigned specific integer values based on what the user inputs. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected, as they remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers from `raw_input()`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers from `raw_input()`**
