Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, and `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`. If `ra > rb`, then the program executes the corresponding statements for that condition. Otherwise, if `rb > ra`, the program executes the statements for that condition.***
