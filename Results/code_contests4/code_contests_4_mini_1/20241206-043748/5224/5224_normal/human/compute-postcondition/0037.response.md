The code `print(2)` outputs the value `2`, but does not affect any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `(xa - xb)`; printed value is 2**
