The value of `print(0)` outputs `0` to the console, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, or `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the action of printing.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is assigned the value `(xa - xb)`, and 0 is printed.**
