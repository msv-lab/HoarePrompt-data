Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n`, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers for each iteration, and `d` is calculated as (xa - xb)² + (ya - yb)² for each iteration. The output for each iteration depends on the conditions checked in the loop, producing either 0, 1, 2, or -2.**
