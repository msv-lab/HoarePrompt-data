Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers, `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`, and `d` is less than or equal to the square of the sum of `ra` and `rb`, `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`. If the square of the difference between `rb` and `ra` is greater than `d`, then -2 is printed. Otherwise, if it is not the case that `(rb - ra) ** 2 > d`, the output is 1.***
