Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers. The value of `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`, and `d` is less than or equal to the square of the sum of `ra` and `rb`. `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`, and it is not the case that `(rb - ra) ** 2 > d`, meaning that `(rb - ra) ** 2` is less than or equal to `d`.***
