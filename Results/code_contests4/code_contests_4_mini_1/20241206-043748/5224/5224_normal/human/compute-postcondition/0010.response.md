Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are input integers. The value of `d` is calculated as `(xa - xb)`, and `d` is less than or equal to the square of the sum of `ra` and `rb`. Additionally, `ra` is greater than `rb`, and it is the case that ((ra - rb) ** 2) is less than or equal to `d`.***
