According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0 (which is its initial value when the loop begins). 

State: **`n` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
