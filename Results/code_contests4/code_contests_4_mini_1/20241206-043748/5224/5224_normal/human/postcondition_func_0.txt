The function accepts an integer N (where 0 < N <= 50) and processes N sets of input data, each containing the coordinates and radii of two circles. For each pair of circles, it calculates the distance between their centers and determines their spatial relationship. It outputs 0 if the circles do not overlap, 1 if they touch or intersect, 2 if one circle is completely inside the other without touching, and -2 if the second circle is completely inside the first without touching. The function handles input and output directly without returning any values.
