Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from `(xa - xb)`. If `d` is greater than `(ra + rb) ** 2`, the output is 0. Otherwise, if `ra` is greater than `rb`, the function executes the corresponding block; if `rb` is greater than or equal to `ra`, it executes the else block.***
