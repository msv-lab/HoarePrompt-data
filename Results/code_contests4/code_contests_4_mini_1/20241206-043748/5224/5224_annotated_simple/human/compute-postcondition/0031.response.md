Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb). If `ra` is greater than `rb`, the program executes the respective operations for that condition. Otherwise, if `rb` is greater than or equal to `ra`, the program executes the operations for that case.***
