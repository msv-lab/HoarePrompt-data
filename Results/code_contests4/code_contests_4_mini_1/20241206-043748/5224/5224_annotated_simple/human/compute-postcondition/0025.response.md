The code prints the value `2`, which does not affect the values of the variables `N`, `n`, `i`, or `d`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the printed value. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb); printed value is 2**
