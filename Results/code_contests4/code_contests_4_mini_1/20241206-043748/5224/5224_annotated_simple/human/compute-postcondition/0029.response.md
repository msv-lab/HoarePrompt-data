The `print(1)` statement outputs the integer `1`. None of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `d`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the printed value.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb); printed value is 1**.
