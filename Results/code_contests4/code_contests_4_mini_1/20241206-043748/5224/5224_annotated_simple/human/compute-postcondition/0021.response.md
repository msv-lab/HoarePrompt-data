According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1**
