The code `print(1)` outputs the integer `1` to the console. It does not modify any variables or affect the previous state of the variables `N`, `n`, `i`, or `d`. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged for these variables while indicating the printed value.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb); printed value is 1**
