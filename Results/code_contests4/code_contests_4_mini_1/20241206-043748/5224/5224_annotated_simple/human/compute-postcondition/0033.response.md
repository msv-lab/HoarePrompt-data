According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

After the increment, `i` will be 2. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, it must remain greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb) and is greater than (ra + rb)**
