The variable `d` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`. The values for `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are provided from the input. Therefore, the value of `d` will depend on these specific input values, but the details of these inputs are not specified in the initial state. Other variables `N`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the calculation and the unchanged state of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2.**
