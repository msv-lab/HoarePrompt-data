The code `print(1)` outputs the integer 1 to the console. It does not affect any of the existing variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, or `d`). Therefore, the Output State remains the same with the addition of the printed value.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from `(xa - xb)`; printed value is 1**
