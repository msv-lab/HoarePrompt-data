The code prints the value -2. The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb) and -2 is printed.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb); -2 is printed.**
