The code `print(1)` outputs the value `1`, but it does not modify any of the existing variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that the value `1` has been printed.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb); value printed is 1**
