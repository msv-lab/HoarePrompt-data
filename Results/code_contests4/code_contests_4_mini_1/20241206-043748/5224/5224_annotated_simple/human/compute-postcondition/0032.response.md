Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `d` is calculated from (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) ** 2, the output is 0. Otherwise, the program evaluates `ra` and `rb`: if `ra` is greater than `rb`, it executes the respective operations for that condition; if `rb` is greater than or equal to `ra`, it executes the operations for that case.***
