The value of `d` is assigned the result of the expression `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`. The variables `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned values from input, and since `d` is calculated from these variables, it will now hold a specific numerical value based on their differences. The previous value of `d` is unknown, but it is stated that `d` is greater than `(ra + rb)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`, and `d` is greater than `(ra + rb)`.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`, and `d` is greater than `(ra + rb)`.**
