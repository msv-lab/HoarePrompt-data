Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is 0; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values from user input; and `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, the output is 0. Otherwise, if `d` is less than or equal to (ra + rb) squared, and if `ra` is greater than `rb` and the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, the output is 2. If `ra` is greater than `rb` and the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is less than or equal to `d`, the output is 1. If `ra` is less than or equal to `rb` and the square of the difference between `rb` and `ra` is greater than `d`, the output is -2. Otherwise, if `ra` is less than or equal to `rb` and the square of the difference between `rb` and `ra` is less than or equal to `d`, the output is 1.***
