The `print(2)` statement outputs the integer `2` to the console. It does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `d`). Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from `(xa - xb)` and the value printed is 2.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated from `(xa - xb)` and the value printed is 2.**
