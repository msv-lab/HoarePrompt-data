The function accepts multiple sets of inputs where each set contains the coordinates and radii of two circles. It evaluates the geometric relationship between the two circles based on their positions and sizes, outputting 0 if they are separate, 1 if they are tangent, 2 if one circle is within the other, and -2 if the second circle is within the first. The function can handle up to 50 sets of input.
