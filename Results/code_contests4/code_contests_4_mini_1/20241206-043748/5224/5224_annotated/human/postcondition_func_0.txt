The function accepts a non-negative integer N (where N â‰¤ 50) and processes N datasets, each consisting of two circles defined by their center coordinates (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) and their radii (ra and rb). It calculates the squared distance between the centers of the circles and determines their spatial relationship, printing the following results for each dataset: "0" if the circles are separate, "2" if circle A is completely within circle B, "-2" if circle B is completely within circle A, and "1" if the circles intersect or touch. The function does not return any value but outputs results directly.
