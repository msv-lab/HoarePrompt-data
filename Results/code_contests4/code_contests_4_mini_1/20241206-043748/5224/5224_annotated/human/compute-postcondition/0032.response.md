Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if `ra` is greater than `rb` and the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, then 2 is printed; if not, 1 is printed. If `ra` is not greater than `rb`, a different operation is executed based on whether the difference (rb - ra) is positive.***
