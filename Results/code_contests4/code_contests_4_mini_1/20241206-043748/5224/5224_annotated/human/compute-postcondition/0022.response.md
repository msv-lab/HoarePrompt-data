The variables `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, and `rb` are assigned values based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which accepts a space-separated string of integers. The values are mapped to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of these variables are not specified, but they will be replaced by the new input values. The variable `N` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned integer values from input.**
