The code snippet `print(1)` will output the integer `1`. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, `d`, `ra`, and `rb` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) and is less than or equal to (ra + rb); `ra` is greater than `rb`; and it is not the case that (ra - rb) squared is greater than d, meaning (ra - rb) squared is less than or equal to d; output is 1.**
