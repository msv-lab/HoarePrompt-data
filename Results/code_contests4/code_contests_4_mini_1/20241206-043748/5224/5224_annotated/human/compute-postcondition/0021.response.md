According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50, `n` can take any value from 0 to 50. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
