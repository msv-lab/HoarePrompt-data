The code outputs a value directly without altering any variables. The value printed is -2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb); and the printed value is -2.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb); printed value is -2**
