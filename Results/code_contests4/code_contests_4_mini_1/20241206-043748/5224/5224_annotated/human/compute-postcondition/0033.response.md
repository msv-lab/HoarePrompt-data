According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, after the last iteration, `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
