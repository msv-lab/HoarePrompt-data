The code simply executes a print statement, which outputs the value `1`. The variables `N`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb), and 1 is printed.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); 1 is printed.**
