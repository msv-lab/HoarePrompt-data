Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) and is less than or equal to (ra + rb); `ra` is greater than `rb`. If the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, the value 2 is printed. Otherwise, if (ra - rb) squared is less than or equal to `d`, the output is 1.***
