The code simply executes the `print(0)` statement, which outputs the value `0`. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb), and the value `0` is printed.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb); value `0` is printed.**
