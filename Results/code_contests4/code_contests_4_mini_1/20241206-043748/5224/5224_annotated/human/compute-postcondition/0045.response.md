Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is `N`; `d` is calculated based on the last values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` from the last iteration; the outputs printed during the loop execution depend on the comparisons of `d`, `ra`, and `rb` across all iterations.**
