Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `ra` is greater than `rb`, then if the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, the printed value is 2; otherwise, the printed output is 1. If `ra` is not greater than `rb`, the printed output is 1 if `(rb - ra)` is greater than or equal to `d`; otherwise, the printed output is 0.***
