Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, 0 is printed. Otherwise, if `ra` is greater than `rb`, 2 is printed if the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, otherwise 1 is printed. If `ra` is not greater than `rb`, 1 is printed if (rb - ra) is greater than or equal to `d`, otherwise 0 is printed.***
