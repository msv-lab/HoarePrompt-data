Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb). If `d` is greater than (ra + rb) squared, the output is 0. Otherwise, if `d` is less than or equal to (ra + rb) squared and `ra` is greater than `rb`, then if the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, the value 2 is printed; otherwise, if (ra - rb) squared is less than or equal to `d`, the output is 1. If `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`, then if the square of the difference between `rb` and `ra` is greater than `d`, -2 is printed; otherwise, 1 is printed.***
