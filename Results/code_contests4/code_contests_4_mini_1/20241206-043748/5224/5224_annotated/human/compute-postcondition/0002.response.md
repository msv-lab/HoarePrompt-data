The variables `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, and `rb` are assigned values based on the output of `raw_input()`, which accepts a space-separated string of integers. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these values into integers. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, and `rb` will depend on the user's input. The variable `N` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are integers obtained from user input.**
