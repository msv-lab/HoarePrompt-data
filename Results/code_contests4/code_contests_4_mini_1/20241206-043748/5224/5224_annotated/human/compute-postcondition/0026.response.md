The code executes a print statement which outputs the integer `1`. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, and `d` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb); and the printed value is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb); and the printed value is 1.**
