Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb). If `ra` is greater than `rb` and the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`, then the value 2 is printed; otherwise, the value 1 is printed. If `ra` is not greater than `rb`, then if the difference `(rb - ra)` is positive, a different operation will be executed based on that condition.***
