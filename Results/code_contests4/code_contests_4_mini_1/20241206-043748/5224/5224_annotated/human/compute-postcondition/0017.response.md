The `print(1)` statement outputs the integer `1`. It does not affect any of the previously defined variables `N`, `i`, `d`, `ra`, or `rb`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same regarding those variables.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); `d` is less than or equal to (ra + rb); `ra` is less than or equal to `rb`; and it is false that ((rb - ra); 1 is printed.**
