To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the affected variables.

The code calculates the value of `d` as the squared distance between two points represented by the coordinates `(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)`. The previous values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.

As a result, the output state will reflect the calculation of `d` based on the provided values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The calculation does not affect the values of `N`, `i`, `ra`, or `rb`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 1; `d` is (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2**.
