The variable `d` is assigned the value of `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are obtained from user input, so they can take on any integer values. The output state reflects the calculation of `d` based on the specific values of these variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2 based on user input.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2 based on user input.**
