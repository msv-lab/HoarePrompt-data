Postcondition: ***`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 0; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) and is less than or equal to (ra + rb); `ra` is greater than `rb`; and it is not the case that (ra - rb) squared is greater than d, meaning (ra - rb) squared is less than or equal to d.***
