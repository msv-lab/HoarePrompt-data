The variable `d` is assigned the value of the expression `(xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2`. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned from input, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, we cannot calculate a specific numerical value for `d`. However, we can express `d` in terms of the input values. The variables `N` and `i` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2.**
