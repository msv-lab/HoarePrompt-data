The code prints the value `1`. The variables `N`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); and the printed output is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; `i` is 2; `d` is calculated as (xa - xb); printed output is 1.**
