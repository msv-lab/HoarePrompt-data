The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `be` and `en`. Both `be` and `en` are tuples containing four integers: `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, where each integer satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. The function processes these integers and returns an output based on specific conditions or calculations involving the input values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `be` and `en`, each being a tuple of four integers (a, b, x, y) within the range of 1 to 2·10^9, and returns a result based on those integers.**
