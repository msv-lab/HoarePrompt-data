Postcondition: ***`be` is less than `en` such that `a + b < x + y`. If `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`, then `be` is equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `en` is updated to `mid - 1`, indicating that either `x * mid` is greater than `a` or `y * mid` is greater than `b` (or both).***
