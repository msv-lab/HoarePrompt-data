According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. The loop continues as long as `be` is less than `en`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `be` is less than `en`, so the loop can execute again.

Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to the current state for the loop to execute one more time, as the condition `be < en` is already satisfied.

State: **`be` is less than `en`**
