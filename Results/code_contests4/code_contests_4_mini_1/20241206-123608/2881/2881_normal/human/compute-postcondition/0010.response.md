The variable `en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` was previously calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2. Since `be` is less than `en`, the value of `mid` is valid and will yield a specific integer result when `be` and `en` are known. Therefore, `en` is now updated to be one less than the calculated value of `mid`. 

The other variable `be` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`be` is less than `en`; `mid` is assigned the value of (be + en + 1) // 2; `en` is now mid - 1.**
