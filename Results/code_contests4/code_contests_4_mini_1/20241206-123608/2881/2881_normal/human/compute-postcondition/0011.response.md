Postcondition: ***`be` is less than `en`. If `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, then `be` is updated to `mid`, and `mid` is recalculated as (be + en + 1) // 2, while `en` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `be` remains less than `en`, `mid` is assigned the value of (be + en + 1) // 2, and `en` is updated to mid - 1.***
