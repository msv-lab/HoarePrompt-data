`be` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2. Since `be` is less than `en`, the value of `mid` will be greater than `be` and less than or equal to `en`. This means that after assigning `mid` to `be`, the value of `be` becomes equal to that of `mid`. The state of the variable `en` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is now equal to `mid`; `mid` is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2; `en` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`be` is now equal to `mid`; `mid` is calculated as (be + en + 1) // 2; `en` remains unchanged.**
