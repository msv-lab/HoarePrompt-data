According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `be` is less than `en`, so the loop can proceed. There are no other states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time since the condition is already satisfied.

State: **`be` is less than `en`**
