Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `be` and `en`, and uses a binary search approach to determine the maximum integer `mid` such that `x * mid` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * mid` is less than or equal to `b`. It then prints the results of `be * x` and `be * y`, which represent the maximum possible quantities based on the constraints given by `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. **
