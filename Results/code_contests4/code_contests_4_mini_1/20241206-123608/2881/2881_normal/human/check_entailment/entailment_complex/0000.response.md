To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the `func_1` and how it relates to the requirements given.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find two integers that represent the screen parameters of a reduced model (width and height) of a monitor such that:
1. The ratio of the sides is `x:y`.
2. The parameters must not exceed the original dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. The area of the screen should be maximized.
4. If it's not possible to achieve this ratio with positive integers within the constraints, the output should be `0 0`.

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1` performs the following:
1. It takes two parameters `be` (begin) and `en` (end) and uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible integer value for `mid` such that:
   - `x * mid <= a`
   - `y * mid <= b`
2. The loop continues until `be` equals `en`, ensuring that the largest feasible `mid` is found.
3. After the loop, it prints the width and height as `be * x` and `be * y`, respectively.

### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Finding Maximum Size:** The binary search correctly identifies the maximum `mid` that satisfies the constraints of the original dimensions. This ensures that the output dimensions correspond to the maximum area while maintaining the specified ratio.
  
2. **Output Conditions:** The program does not explicitly check if the calculated dimensions (`be * x` and `be * y`) are positive integers. However, the way the binary search is structured ensures that if `x * mid` or `y * mid` cannot fit within `a` or `b`, the search space narrows down accordingly. If `mid` cannot be set to a positive integer that satisfies both conditions, the output will be derived from the last valid `mid`, which will be `0` if the conditions are not met.

3. **Handling Non-Feasibility:** The program does not have an explicit return of `0 0` in cases where it is impossible to achieve the dimensions. However, if `mid` is unable to find a suitable positive integer that meets the dimension requirements, `be` would ultimately not increase from its initial state, leading to a result that does not meet the conditions, thereby returning `0 0` implicitly through the final print statement.

### Conclusion
The program accurately implements the requirements set forth by the problem description. It finds the maximum screen dimensions that respect the ratio and the original size constraints.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
