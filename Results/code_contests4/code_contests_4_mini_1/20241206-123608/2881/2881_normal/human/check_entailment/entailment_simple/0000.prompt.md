You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Reca company makes monitors, the most popular of their models is AB999 with the screen size a × b centimeters. Because of some production peculiarities a screen parameters are integer numbers. Recently the screen sides ratio x: y became popular with users. That's why the company wants to reduce monitor AB999 size so that its screen sides ratio becomes x: y, at the same time they want its total area to be maximal of all possible variants. Your task is to find the screen parameters of the reduced size model, or find out that such a reduction can't be performed.

Input

The first line of the input contains 4 integers — a, b, x and y (1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·109).

Output

If the answer exists, output 2 positive integers — screen parameters of the reduced size model. Output 0 0 otherwise.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: be and en are four integers a, b, x, and y such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(be, en):
    while be < en:
        mid = (be + en + 1) // 2
        
        if x * mid <= a and y * mid <= b:
            be = mid
        else:
            en = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `be` is equal to `en`, and `x * be` is less than or equal to `a` and `y * be` is less than or equal to `b`.
    print(be * x, be * y)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
