Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the required aspect ratio cannot fit within the given dimensions of the monitor, specifically when the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is greater than both a and b. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 1 2
```
In this case, the required dimensions based on the aspect ratio (1:2) would be (1, 2). However, the monitor dimensions are (1, 1), which cannot accommodate an output of (1, 2). The program will return (1, 2) instead of (0, 0) as it should, indicating that the reduction cannot be performed. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
