To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Overview:
The problem requires us to determine if we can transform an initial array filled with zeroes into a target array using a specific operation: at each step, we can choose a position in the array and increase it by \( k^i \) (where \( i \) is the step index) or skip the step.

### Key Points for Evaluation:
1. **Input Reading**: We need to handle multiple test cases and read the required values correctly.
2. **Core Logic**:
   - For each element in the target array (let's call it `li`), the code attempts to determine how many times we can increase a position based on powers of \( k \).
   - The code uses a set to track the used powers of \( k \) to avoid duplicate increments at the same step.
3. **Output**: The program should return "YES" if we can achieve the target configuration and "NO" otherwise.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Large Values**: The target values can be as large as \( 10^{16} \). The program needs to ensure it can handle the computation of powers of \( k \) efficiently without exceeding limits.
2. **Logic Flaw in Duplicate Handling**: The logic for checking if a specific power has already been used (`if j in req`) seems to be aimed at ensuring that we do not use the same power multiple times across different elements. However, depending on the construction of `li`, there might be cases where this check can lead to incorrect conclusions.
3. **Failure Case**: 
    - Consider the case where \( k = 2 \) and we need to form the array from `[0, 0, 0]` to `[1, 1, 0]`. The code might incorrectly determine that it's impossible to achieve this because it cannot use the same power at different indices, which is not how the problem is framed.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not account for all possible scenarios where multiple increments may be needed on different indices without conflicting. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description correctly for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example Case Where It Fails:
For input:
```
1
3 2
1 1 0
```
The expected output is "YES" (we can achieve it by applying \( 2^0 \) to the first and second elements), but the program may return "NO" due to its logic of avoiding duplicate powers in the set.
