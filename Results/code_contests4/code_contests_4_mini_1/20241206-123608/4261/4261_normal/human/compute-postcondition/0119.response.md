According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which means the loop cannot execute. To allow the loop to execute for the first time, `i` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `j` is the highest integer such that `li[0]` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `req` includes all integers obtained during the loop iterations**
