The value of `i` is updated to `i //= k ** j`, which means `i` is being divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `j` is the largest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, this operation will ensure that `i` will still be greater than or equal to 1 after the division. The variable `req` remains unchanged, and its state continues to include all integers from 1 to `j`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is reduced to a value that is greater than or equal to 1, `j` remains the largest integer such that `i` was a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `req` includes all integers from 1 to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is reduced to a value that is greater than or equal to 1, `j` remains the largest integer such that `i` was a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `req` includes all integers from 1 to `j`.**
