According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop will not execute again unless `i` is adjusted. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. 

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's condition.

State: **`i` is greater than 0**.
