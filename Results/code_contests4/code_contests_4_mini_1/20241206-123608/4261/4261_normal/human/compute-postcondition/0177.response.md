Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes an integer list to check certain divisibility conditions involving a base `k`. It determines whether any calculated values from the input list, when reduced iteratively, have been seen before. If a duplicate is found, it calls `func_2` with 'NO' and exits; otherwise, after all iterations, it calls `func_2` with 'YES'. The function does not return any specific value. **
