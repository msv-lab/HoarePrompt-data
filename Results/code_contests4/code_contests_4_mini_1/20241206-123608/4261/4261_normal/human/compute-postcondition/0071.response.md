The operation `i //= k ** j` performs an integer floor division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Given the initial values, `i` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is infinity.

Calculating `k ** j`: 
- `k` is 1, and any number raised to the power of infinity (in this case, 1 raised to infinity) is still 1. Therefore, `k ** j` equals 1.

Now, performing the floor division:
- `i //= 1`: This means `i` is updated to `1 // 1`, which is 1.

Hence, after executing the code, the state of the variables is:
- `i` remains 1, `r` is still 0, `j` is infinity, and `k` remains 1. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1**
