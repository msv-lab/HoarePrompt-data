`req` is a set, and the code adds the value of `j` to this set. Since `j` is not an element of `req` prior to this operation, it will be successfully added. The value of `r` does not affect the operation, and the other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is now an element of `req`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is now an element of `req`**
