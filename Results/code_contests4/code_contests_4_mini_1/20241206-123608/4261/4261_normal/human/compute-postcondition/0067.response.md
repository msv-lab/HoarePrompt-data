The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `r`, and `k`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is still 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is still 1**
