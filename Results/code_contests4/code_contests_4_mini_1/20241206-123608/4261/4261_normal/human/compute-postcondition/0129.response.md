The value of `j` is incremented by `r`. The previous value of `j` is dependent on the largest integer such that `i` was a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `req` includes all integers from 1 to `j`. Since `r` is added to `j`, the new value of `j` will be the previous value plus `r`. The values of `i` and `req` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is reduced to a value that is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is now increased by `r`, and `req` includes all integers from 1 to the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is reduced to a value that is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is now increased by `r`, and `req` includes all integers from 1 to the new value of `j`.**
