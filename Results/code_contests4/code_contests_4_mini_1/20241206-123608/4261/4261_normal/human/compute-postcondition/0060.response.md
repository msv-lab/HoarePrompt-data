According to the code, the for loop is iterating over the list `li`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which indicates that the loop has executed once and is currently at the first element of the list `li`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to increment to the next index in the list. 

Since `i` is currently 0, it will increment to 1 for the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `li`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `li` must have at least 2 elements (so that `i` can be 1).

State: **`i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `li` must contain at least 2 elements.**
