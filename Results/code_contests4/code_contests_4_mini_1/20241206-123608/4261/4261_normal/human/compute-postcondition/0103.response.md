The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`i` and `k`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a multiple of `k`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `i` must also be a multiple of `k`.

Output State: **`i` is a multiple of `k`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `i` must also be a multiple of `k**
