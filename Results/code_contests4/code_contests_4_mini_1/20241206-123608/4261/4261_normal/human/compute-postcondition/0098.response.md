According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is now the result of `i` divided by `k` minus 1. For `i` to be greater than 0, the expression `i / k - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies that `i / k` must be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be greater than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is now the integer result of `i` divided by `k` minus 1 and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than `k`**
