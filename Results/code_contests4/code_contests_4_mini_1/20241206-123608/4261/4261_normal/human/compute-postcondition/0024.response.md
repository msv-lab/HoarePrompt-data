The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates based on the constraints provided for `T`, `n`, `k`, and the array `a`. It processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, `T` is a positive integer indicating the number of cases, `n` is a positive integer specifying the size of the array, `k` is an integer that affects the logic of the function, and `a` is an array containing `n` non-negative integers. 

The output of the function is determined based on the logic implemented within it, which is not described here. However, it is inferred that the function will return results for each test case based on the input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to handle multiple test cases related to the specified parameters.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases based on the constraints of T (number of cases), n (size of the array), k (an integer affecting logic), and a (an array of non-negative integers). It returns results for each test case based on these inputs.**
