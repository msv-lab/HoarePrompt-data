`r` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is infinity, so after execution, `r` becomes infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, and `req` now includes infinity.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, and `req` now includes infinity**
