The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, `r` will now hold that value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`; `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`; `r` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`; `j` is the highest integer such that `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`; `r` is equal to `j`.**
