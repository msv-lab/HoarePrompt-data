According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. For the loop to execute again, the result of `i % k ** (j + 1)` must still equal 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `i` remains unchanged. This implies that `j + 1` equals 2, meaning we need to check if `i` is divisible by `k ** 2`. 

Since `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy the divisibility condition for `k` raised to the power of 2 (i.e., `k ** 2`). There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is 1, `i` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be divisible by `k ** 2`**
