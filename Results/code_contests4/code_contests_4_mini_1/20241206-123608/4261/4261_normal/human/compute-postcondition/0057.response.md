The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is increased by `r`, which implies that `j` had some value before this assignment, we cannot determine the exact current value of `j` after this operation. However, we know that `j` is still an element of `req`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is an element of `req`, and `r` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`j` is an element of `req`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`**
