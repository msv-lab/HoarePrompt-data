The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The value of `i` remains a multiple of `k`, and since the loop can execute again only if `i` is also a multiple of `k`, that condition is satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a multiple of `k`, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`i` is a multiple of `k`, `j` is 3**
