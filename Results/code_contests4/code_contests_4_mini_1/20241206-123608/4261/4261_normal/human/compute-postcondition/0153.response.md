The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is increased by `r`, it means `r` holds the current value of `j`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `req`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0; `j` is the largest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k^j`; `k` is greater than 0; `j` is not in `req`; `j` has been added to `req`; `r` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0; `j` is the largest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k^j`; `k` is greater than 0; `j` is not in `req`; `j` has been added to `req`; `r` is equal to `j`.**
