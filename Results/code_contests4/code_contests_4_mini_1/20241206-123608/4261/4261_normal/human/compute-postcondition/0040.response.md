The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so it remains unchanged in the output state. The values of `j`, `req`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is decreased by 1, `j` is added to `req`, and `r` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is decreased by 1, `j` is added to `req`, and `r` is assigned the value of `j`.**
