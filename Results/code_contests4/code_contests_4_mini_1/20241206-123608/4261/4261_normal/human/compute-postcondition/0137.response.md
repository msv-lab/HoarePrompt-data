According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must currently be at least 1.

State: **`i` is greater than 0**
