The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `k` must be a positive integer that divides `i` and satisfies that `i` is divisible by `k^2`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `k` must be a positive integer that divides `i` and satisfies that `i` is divisible by `k^2`.**
