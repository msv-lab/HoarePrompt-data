The variable `r` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous state indicates that `j` is an element of `req`, but the specific value of `j` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numeric value for `r`. The other variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged as a result of this assignment. 

Output State: **`i` is now the integer result of `i` divided by `k`; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is now an element of `req`; `r` is assigned the value of `j`**.
