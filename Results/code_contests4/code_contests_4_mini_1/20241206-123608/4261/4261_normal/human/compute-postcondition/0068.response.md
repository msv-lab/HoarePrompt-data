To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `r` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `k` is still 1

Now, we calculate `k ** (j + 1)`. Since `k` is 1 and `j` is 2:

1. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `j + 1` = 2 + 1 = 3
2. Calculate `k ** (j + 1)`:
   - `k ** (3)` = 1 ** 3 = 1

Now, we check the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`:
- This becomes `1 % 1 == 0`, which is true.

Since the condition is currently true, it means the loop can execute one more time without needing to adjust the states.

Therefore, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is still 1**.
