The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set or collection `req`. Since `j` is increased by `r` and is not already in `req`, after execution, `j` will be added to `req`, but the values of `i` and `j` themselves do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been added to `req` while `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` remains unchanged, `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is added to `req`**
