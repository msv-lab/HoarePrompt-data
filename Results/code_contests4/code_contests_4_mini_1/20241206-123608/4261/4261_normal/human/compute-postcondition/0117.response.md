According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `li`. The variable `i` at the end of the last iteration is -1, which means that it points to the element before the first element of `li`. This indicates that the loop has not yet executed at all, so we need to consider the first element of `li` for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `i` should take the value of the first element in `li`. Since `i` is currently -1, we can assume that the next value of `i` will be 0 (if considering 0-based indexing), and we need to determine `r` and `j` based on this new value.

Given that `i` will now be pointing to the first element, we need to set `r` and `j` according to whether the first element is a multiple of `k`. If the first element of `li` is denoted as `li[0]`, we can calculate `r` and `j` accordingly.

For the loop to execute one more time, assuming `li` has at least one element, we need to set `i` to 0, and we need to determine `r` and `j` based on the first element being processed.

Thus, the updated state will be:
State: **`i` is 0, `r` is the highest integer such that `li[0]` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is the highest integer such that `li[0]` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `req` includes all integers obtained during the loop iterations.**
