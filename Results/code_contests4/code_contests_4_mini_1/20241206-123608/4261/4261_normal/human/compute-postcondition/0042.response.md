The value of `j` is assigned to 0, which updates its previous value. The values of `i` and `r` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `r` was previously assigned the value of `j`, so now `r` will also be updated to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, `r` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, `r` is 0**
