The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. The variable `i` remains greater than 0, and the condition for `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 1, while `i` and the conditions regarding `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, k must be a positive integer that divides `i**
