The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, but it is being reset to `0`. The other variables `i`, `r`, and `req` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 0, and `req` includes all integers obtained during the loop iterations.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 0, and `req` includes all integers obtained during the loop iterations.**
