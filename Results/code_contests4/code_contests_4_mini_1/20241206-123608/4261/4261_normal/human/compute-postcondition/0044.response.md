The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` must be a divisor of `i` and less than or equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` must be a divisor of `i` and less than or equal to `i**
