The code `i //= k ** j` performs an integer division of `i` by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Given the initial state where `i` is greater than 1 and `j` is defined as the maximum integer such that `k`, we can analyze the impact.

Since `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is a maximum integer based on `k`, `k ** j` will yield a significant value depending on the value of `k`. The exact outcome of `i` after the operation will depend on the specific values of `i`, `k`, and `j`.

However, without concrete values for `k` and `j`, we can only conclude the operation's effect. The value of `i` will be reduced by a factor of `k ** j`, and the result will still be greater than or equal to 0 (since integer division cannot yield a negative).

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State will summarize the conditions and the effect of the operation.

Output State: **`i` is reduced by integer division with `k ** j`, where `i` is greater than 1 and `j` is the maximum integer such that `k`**.
