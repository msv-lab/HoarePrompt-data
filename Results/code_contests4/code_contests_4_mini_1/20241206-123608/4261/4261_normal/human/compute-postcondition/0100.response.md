According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i % k ** (j + 1)` must be equal to 0. 

Right before the loop, `i` is the integer result of `i` divided by `k` minus 1, and `j` is 0. This means that `j + 1` is equal to 1, so the condition simplifies to `i % k == 0`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be divisible by `k`. Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted such that `i % k == 0`. Since `i` is currently defined as the result of `i/k - 1`, we need to make sure this results in a value that is a multiple of `k`.

Therefore, we can state the requirement for `i` to be adjusted as follows: `i` must be a multiple of `k`.

State: **`i` is a multiple of `k`, `j` is 0**
