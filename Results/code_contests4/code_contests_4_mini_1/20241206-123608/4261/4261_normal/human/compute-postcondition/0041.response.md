According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been decreased by 1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 1 before the next iteration. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to be greater than 0, specifically it needs to be at least 1 before the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is greater than 1, `j` is added to `req`, and `r` is assigned the value of `j`**
