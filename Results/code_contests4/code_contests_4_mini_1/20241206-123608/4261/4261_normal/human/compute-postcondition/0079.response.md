The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 0. The states of the other variables (`r`, `j`, `k`, and `req`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, and `req` includes infinity.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r` is infinity, `j` is infinity, `k` is 1, and `req` includes infinity**.
