To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to analyze the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is a multiple of `k ** (j + 1)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is a multiple of `k`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `i` must also be a multiple of `k`. 

1. Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` equals 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k ** 3` for the loop to execute again.
2. Currently, we know that `i` is a multiple of `k`, but we do not know if it is a multiple of `k ** 3`. Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` must also be a multiple of `k ** 3` for the loop to continue.

So, the necessary adjustment is that `i` should be specified as a multiple of `k ** 3`.

State: **`i` is a multiple of `k`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `i` must also be a multiple of `k ** 3`**
