The `file.write(sep)` function call writes the value of `sep`, which is a space character (' '), to the `file`. The other variables, including `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `at_start`, and `args`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an array of `n` non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` now contains a space followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 3 elements with `x` as the third element in `args`.
