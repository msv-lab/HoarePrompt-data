Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an array of `n` non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` now contains a space followed by the string representation of the third element in `args`, `at_start` is False, and `args` contains at least 3 elements with `x` as the third element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, the state of the program remains as described; there are no changes made in the absence of an else part.***
