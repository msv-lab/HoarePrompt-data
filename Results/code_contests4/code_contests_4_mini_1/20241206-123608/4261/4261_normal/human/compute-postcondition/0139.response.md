According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i % k ** (j + 1)` must be equal to 0. Since `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is currently 0, we need to ensure that `k` is a positive integer such that `i` is divisible by `k`. 

However, since `j` is 0, we are checking if `i` is divisible by `k`. For the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 and that `i` is divisible by `k`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is greater than 0; `j` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time then `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is divisible by `k`**
