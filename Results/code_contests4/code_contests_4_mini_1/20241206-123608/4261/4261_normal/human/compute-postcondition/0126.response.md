The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is not specified. The value of `i` remains unchanged, but it is stated that `i` is greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`, allowing the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1**
