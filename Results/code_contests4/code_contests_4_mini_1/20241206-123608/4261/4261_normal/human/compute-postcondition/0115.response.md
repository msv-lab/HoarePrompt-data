The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` was previously a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, after decrementing, `i` may no longer be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`. The values of `j` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is now `i - 1`, `j` is the highest integer such that `i` was a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `r` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is now `i - 1`, `j` is the highest integer such that `i` was a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `r` is equal to `j`.**
