According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop condition checks if `i` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `i` is greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`
- `j` has been increased by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must also be a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. Since `j` has been increased by 1 in the last iteration, the condition will check if `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

Given that `i` was already a multiple of `k` at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is also a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is a multiple of `k ** (j + 1)`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `i` is also a multiple of `k ** (j + 1)`**
