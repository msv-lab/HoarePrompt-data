The code provided is a docstring, which does not affect any variables or the program state. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30), `k` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100), and `a` is an array of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^{16}) for each test case.**
