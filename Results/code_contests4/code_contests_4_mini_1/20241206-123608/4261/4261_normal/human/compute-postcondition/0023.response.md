Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an array of `n` non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` has been modified by writing either `kwargs['end']` or `'\n'`, `at_start` is False, and `args` contains all elements processed. If the flush operation has been performed on `file`, then the corresponding changes are reflected in `file`.***
