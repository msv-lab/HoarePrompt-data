The value of `j` is incremented by `r`, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, and it will depend on the specific calculations related to `i` and `k`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `j` is the largest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k^j`, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `i`, and `j` is increased by `r`. 

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is the largest integer such that `i` is divisible by `k^j`, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `i`, and `j` is increased by `r.**
