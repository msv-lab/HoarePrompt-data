The value of `r` is assigned to 0. The previous value of `r` is unspecified, but after this assignment, `r` is now 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is the highest integer such that `li[0]` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `req` includes all integers obtained during the loop iterations.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is the highest integer such that `li[0]` is a multiple of `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `req` includes all integers obtained during the loop iterations.**
