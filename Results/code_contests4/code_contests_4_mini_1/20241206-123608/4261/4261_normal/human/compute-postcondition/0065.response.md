`j` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. After execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` must still be 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` must still be 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
