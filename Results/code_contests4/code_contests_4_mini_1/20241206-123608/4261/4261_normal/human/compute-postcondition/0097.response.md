The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is the integer result of `i` divided by `k`, but the exact value is not provided. The other variables `j`, `r`, and `req` remain unaffected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the change in `i`.

Output State: **`i` is now the integer result of `i` divided by `k` minus 1; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is now an element of `req`; `r` is assigned the value of `j`**
