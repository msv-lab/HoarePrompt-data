The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `j` is 1, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `k` is a divisor of `i`, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to the square root of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `k` is a divisor of `i`, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to the square root of `i`**.
