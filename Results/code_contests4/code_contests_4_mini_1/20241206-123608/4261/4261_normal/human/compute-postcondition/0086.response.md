According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is a positive integer that divides `i` and satisfies that `i` is divisible by `k^2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be divisible by `k^3` (since `j + 1` equals 3). The current state indicates that `i` is divisible by `k^2`, but we need to ensure that it remains divisible by `k^3`. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the requirement to ensure that `i` is divisible by `k^3`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be divisible by k^3**
