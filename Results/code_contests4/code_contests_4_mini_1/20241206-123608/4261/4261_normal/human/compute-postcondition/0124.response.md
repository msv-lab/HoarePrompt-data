The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variable `i` is greater than 0 and must be a multiple of `k` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0 and a multiple of `k`; `j` is increased by 1**
