The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. Since `sep` is assigned the value of a space character (' '), the `file` now contains a space written to it. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an array of `n` non-negative integers, `sep` is ' ', `file` has a space written to it, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`.
