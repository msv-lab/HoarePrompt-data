To determine the conditions under which the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the expression `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. 

1. The loop's execution depends on whether `i` is divisible by `k ** (j + 1)`. 
2. Right before the loop, we have `i` as 1, `r` as 0, and `j` as 0. 
3. Plugging the values into the loop condition, we have `1 % k ** (0 + 1) == 0`, which simplifies to `1 % k == 0`. 

For the expression `1 % k == 0` to be true, `k` must be equal to 1 (since any number greater than 1 will not divide 1 evenly). 

Thus, we need to adjust the state so that `k` is set to 1 to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `r` is 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `k` must be 1**
