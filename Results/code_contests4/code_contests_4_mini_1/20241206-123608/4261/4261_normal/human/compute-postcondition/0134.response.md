The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. Since `j` is specified to not be an element of `req` before this operation, after executing this code, `j` will be included in `req`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `j` has been increased by `r`, `req` now includes all integers from 1 to the new value of `j` plus the new element `j`, and `j` is an element of `req`.

Output State: **`i` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `j` has been increased by `r`, `req` now includes all integers from 1 to the new value of `j` plus the new element `j`, and `j` is an element of `req`.**
