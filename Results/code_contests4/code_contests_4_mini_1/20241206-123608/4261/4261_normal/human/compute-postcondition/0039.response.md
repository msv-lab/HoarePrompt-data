The value of `r` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is increased by `r` prior to this assignment, the specific value of `j` is not given in the initial state, but `i` remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `r` takes on the current value of `j`, and `j` itself remains unchanged at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` remains unchanged, `j` is added to `req`, and `r` is assigned the value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` remains unchanged, `j` is added to `req`, and `r` is assigned the value of `j`**.
