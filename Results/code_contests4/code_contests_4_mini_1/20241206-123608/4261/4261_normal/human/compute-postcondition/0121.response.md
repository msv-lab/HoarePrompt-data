To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions given.

The loop condition is `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. This means that for the loop to execute, `i` must be divisible by `k ** (j + 1)`.

1. Since `i` is greater than 0, we know that `i` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `j` is currently 0, which means the condition simplifies to `i % k == 0`. This states that `i` must be divisible by `k`.
3. The value of `k` is not provided, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be divisible by whatever the value of `k` is.

Given that the loop will execute if `i` is divisible by `k`, we need to ensure that the current value of `i` satisfies this condition. If `i` is not currently divisible by `k`, then adjustments need to be made.

To summarize:
- We have `i > 0`, but we need to ensure that `i` is divisible by `k` for the loop to execute one more time.
- Without specific values for `k`, we can only state that `i` must be adjusted to be a multiple of `k`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we can say:
State: **`i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` must be a multiple of `k`**.
