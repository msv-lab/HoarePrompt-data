The code `req.add(j)` adds the value of `j` to the set `req`. Since `j` is not an element of `req` prior to this operation, `j` will now be included in `req`. The previous values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and only the set `req` is modified by adding `j`.

Output State: **`i` is now the integer result of `i` divided by `k`; `j` is increased by `r`; `j` is now an element of `req`.**
