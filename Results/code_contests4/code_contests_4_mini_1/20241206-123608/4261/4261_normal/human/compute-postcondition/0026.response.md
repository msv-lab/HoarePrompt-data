The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 0, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for the loop to execute the first time is still related to `i` being greater than `k`, which is not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than `k`.**
