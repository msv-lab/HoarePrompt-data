The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for the loop execution is based on `i` being divisible by `k^3`, which is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `i` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `i` must still be divisible by `k^3`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `i` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be divisible by `k^3`.**
