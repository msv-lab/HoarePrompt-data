The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial state states that `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `i**
