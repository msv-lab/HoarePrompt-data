The code initializes `j` to 0. The previous state mentions that `i` is the integer result of `i` divided by `k` minus 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than `k`. The value of `j` is now set to 0, but other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the integer result of `i` divided by `k` minus 1, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is the integer result of `i` divided by `k` minus 1, `j` is 0**.
