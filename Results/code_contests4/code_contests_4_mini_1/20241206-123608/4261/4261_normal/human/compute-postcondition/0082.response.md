To determine the conditions under which the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the loop statement:

```
while i % k ** (j + 1) == 0:
```

The loop will execute as long as the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is true. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is greater than 0
- `j` is 0

We can deduce the following:
- Since `j` is 0, the expression `k ** (j + 1)` simplifies to `k ** 1`, which is just `k`.
- Therefore, the loop condition becomes `i % k == 0`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be divisible by `k`. However, we do not have information about the value of `k`. 

Since `i` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `i` is a multiple of `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is less than or equal to `i`.

Thus, the required state modification is:
- `k` must be a positive integer that divides `i`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be a positive integer that divides `i`**
