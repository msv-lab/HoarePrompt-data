To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its output hints step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine if an array `v` filled with zeroes can be transformed into a target array `a` using a specific algorithm involving powers of `k`. The algorithm allows us to increment any position `pos` in `v` by `k^i` at the `i-th` step, or to skip the step.

### Code Analysis
The code consists of two functions:
1. **func_1**: This function processes the input array `a` and checks if we can achieve the target configuration.
2. **func_2**: This function is responsible for printing results based on whether we can achieve the target array configuration.

#### Key Logic in func_1:
- It attempts to reduce each element in the array `a` by continually dividing by `k` and tracking the "exponents" (i.e., how many times each position can be incremented by `k^i`).
- It uses a `set` called `req` to record the exponents that have already been seen. If an exponent is repeated, it concludes that the target configuration cannot be achieved and outputs "NO"; otherwise, it outputs "YES".

### Output Hints
The output hints indicate that:
- The function checks for duplicates in the calculated exponents after reducing the values of `a`.
- If duplicates are found, it immediately concludes that the transformation is impossible ("NO"). If no duplicates are found after processing all elements, it prints "YES".

### Edge Cases
1. **Zeroes in the Target Array**: The code correctly handles the case where the target array consists of zeroes since no operations are needed.
2. **Large Values of `a[i]`**: The code has to be efficient in handling values up to `10^16`. The use of division by `k` helps to reduce the values progressively.
3. **Duplicate Values in `a`**: If two elements in `a` require the same exponent to reach zero (e.g., both being `1`), the code must catch this as failure.

### Potential Issues
- The logic within the nested loops may not properly handle cases where the exponent calculation could lead to an invalid situation. Specifically, if multiple elements in `a` can result in the same exponent after reductions, the code should return "NO".

### Conclusion
Upon analyzing both the code and the output hints, I found that the function checks for duplicates based on the calculated values from `a`. The condition checks seem to align with the problem requirements. However, the handling of edge cases, particularly when calculating powers and reducing values, can lead to incorrect results if not all cases are covered.

For instance, if two elements in `a` are `1`, both would require reaching the same exponent (0), causing the function to mistakenly output "NO" when it should validate that both can be achieved separately.

Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly in handling duplicate values in `a`.

**Correctness: False**. 
The function does not correctly handle cases where multiple elements in `a` require the same exponent, which can lead to incorrect conclusions about the possibility of reaching the target array.
