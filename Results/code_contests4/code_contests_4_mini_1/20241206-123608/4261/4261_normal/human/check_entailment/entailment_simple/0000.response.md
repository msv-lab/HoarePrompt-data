To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires checking if an array `v` (initially filled with zeroes) can be transformed into a given array `a` by performing a series of operations. In each step, you can either:
1. Choose a position in the array `v` and increase its value by `k^i` (where `i` is the step index).
2. Skip the step.

The goal is to decide if it is possible to achieve the target array `a` through these operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It takes `n` (size of array) and `k` (the base for exponentiation).
   - It processes each element in the target array `li` (which corresponds to `a`).
   - A set `req` is used to track distinct values that can be generated.
   - For each element `i` in `li`, it checks how many times `i` can be divided by increasing powers of `k`. This is done using the inner while loop.
   - The outer while loop iterates until `i` is reduced to zero, during which it calculates a value `j` that represents a combination of powers of `k` that could contribute to the value of `a`.
   - If the value `j` has already been encountered (i.e., if `j` is in `req`), it returns "NO" (indicating it's impossible to achieve the target).
   - If all values are processed without duplicating, it returns "YES".

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function simply prints the result ("YES" or "NO").

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic of `func_1()` is primarily concerned with identifying whether the powers of `k` can be uniquely assigned to the positions in `v` to match the target values in `a`.
- The program correctly handles the possibility of forming the target array by using a set to track already used power combinations, ensuring that each power is uniquely assigned to one position.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where the target array is already zero (it can simply skip all steps).
- It also checks for duplicate values in the target array, which would be impossible to form since each position can only be incremented uniquely by distinct powers of `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the explanation of the algorithm's flow and its handling of the conditions described in the problem statement, the program appears to be correct. It systematically checks the feasibility of achieving each target array based on the defined operations.

Thus, the final output is:

Correctness: **True**
