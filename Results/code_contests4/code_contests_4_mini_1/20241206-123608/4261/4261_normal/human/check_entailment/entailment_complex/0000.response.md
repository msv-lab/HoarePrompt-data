To determine the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze how the code processes the input and whether it successfully meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can transform an array of zeros into a given array `a` by incrementing specific positions with powers of `k` at each step.
- Each step allows either to increment a position or skip.
- The goal is to see if we can achieve exactly the values in `a` using the powers of `k` (i.e., `k^0`, `k^1`, ...).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each element in the list `li` (which corresponds to the array `a`).
   - For each element `i`, it calculates how many times `i` can be divided by increasing powers of `k` and keeps track of the values using a set `req`.
   - If a calculated value of `j` (which is based on the power of `k` and how many times it can divide `i`) has been seen before (i.e., is already in `req`), it outputs 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it outputs 'YES'.

2. **Potential Issues:**
   - The inner logic of calculating `j` and checking for duplicates might not account for all ways to combine powers of `k` to form the required values in `a`.
   - The program only considers distinct outcomes of the division process but does not properly verify if all values in `a` can be formed with the allowed operations.
   - For example, if the target array `a` contains two of the same value greater than zero, such as `[1, 1]`, it will fail because there aren't enough distinct powers of `k` to achieve two increments of `1` from zero.

### Test Case Analysis:
Taking the provided test cases into account:
- For the input `3 4` with `1 4 1`, it should return `NO`, as the program should not be able to achieve two `1`s from zero as per the requirements, which is consistent with the earlier analysis.
- However, the programâ€™s logic of tracking duplicates based on `j` may not adequately ensure that distinct operations can cover all values required in `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not provide a comprehensive solution to the problem. Specifically, the logic fails to guarantee that all values in `a` can be formed correctly, particularly in scenarios where duplicate increments are needed.

**Correctness: False**

The main case where the program fails is when `a` contains multiple instances of the same non-zero value, as seen in the example `[1, 1]`, where the program should return `NO`, but it may not handle this properly due to its reliance on the set and the calculation of `j`.
