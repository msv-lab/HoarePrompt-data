To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the program.

The problem states that Vasya has two girlfriends, Dasha and Masha, and he travels to them based on the frequency of the trains. The program's goal is to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more frequently based on the frequencies of the trains (given by integers `a` and `b`).

The program seems to use the following steps:

1. It defines a function `func_1(a, b)` which appears to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using recursion.
2. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `g = a * b / func_1(a, b)`.
3. Then, it checks the frequency of visits based on the LCM and prints "Equal", "Dasha", or "Masha" depending on the calculated conditions.

Let's break down the potential issues:

1. **Condition Check Logic**: The condition `if g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1:` is used to determine if Vasya visits both girlfriends equally. This seems logically flawed because the frequency should be derived from how many times Vasya can visit each girlfriend in the LCM period, which would be `(LCM / a)` for Dasha and `(LCM / b)` for Masha. The current logic doesn't cover all scenarios properly.

2. **Input Handling and Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are such that `g / min(a, b)` does not yield an integer. This could lead to incorrect evaluations or division errors in other contexts.

3. **Potential Outputs**: If `a` is much smaller than `b`, it could lead to frequent visits to Dasha, but the condition checking may yield an incorrect result.

For example, if we consider `a = 2` and `b = 3`:
- LCM is `6`.
- Dasha visits: `6 / 2 = 3` times, Masha visits: `6 / 3 = 2` times.
- Expected output should be "Dasha".
- However, with the current logic, it may not evaluate correctly based on the flawed conditions.

Given these points, the program fails to logically cover all potential cases accurately and can yield incorrect results based on certain inputs.

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program can fail to produce the expected outcome for certain inputs, such as `a = 2` and `b = 3`, where it should output "Dasha" but may not do so based on the logic implemented.
