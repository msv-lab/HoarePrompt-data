Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. 

1. **Logic Error in the GCD Calculation and Output**: The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, but the subsequent logic for determining how often Vasya visits Dasha or Masha is incorrect. The calculation `g = a * b / func_1(a, b)` is intended to find the least common multiple (LCM), but the subsequent conditions do not correctly account for the intervals in which Vasya would choose one girlfriend over the other.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Comparison**: The condition `if g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is not a correct way to determine if he goes to Dasha or Masha more frequently. This condition does not logically represent the intervals during which Vasya would prefer one girlfriend over the other based on the arrival times of the trains.

3. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is a function in Python 2, but the context implies that the program should be written in Python 3 (where `input()` should be used instead).

4. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases explicitly stated in the problem description, such as when both trains arrive simultaneously. The decision-making based on the frequency of the trains is not correctly implemented.

To illustrate a case where the program fails:
- For input `3 7`, the expected output is `Dasha`, as per the problem description. However, due to the logical flaws in the program's structure and conditions, it may not yield the correct output.

Thus, the program does not meet the correctness criteria outlined in the problem description.
