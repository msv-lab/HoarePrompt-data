Functionality: ** The function accepts two distinct positive integers `a` and `b`, and it computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns `a` if `b` is 0; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). This process continues until one of the numbers becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD. **
