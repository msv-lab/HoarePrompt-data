The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are distinct positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6. If `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`. Otherwise, it calls itself with the parameters `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (i.e., `a % b`). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two distinct positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the value of `a` if `b` is 0; otherwise, it continues to compute by calling itself with updated parameters until a base condition is met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two distinct positive integers `a` and `b`, returns `a` if `b` is 0; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`.**
