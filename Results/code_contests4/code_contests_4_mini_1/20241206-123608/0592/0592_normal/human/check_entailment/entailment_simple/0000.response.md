Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The problem asks for determination of which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently based on the frequencies of the trains to each girlfriend. However, the annotated program only computes the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the two frequencies `a` and `b` using a recursive function, which is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following points:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` is designed to return the GCD of `a` and `b`, which does not provide any information about the frequency of visits to Dasha or Masha. The problem requires counting how often Vasya visits each girlfriend based on the train arrival times, not calculating their GCD.

2. **Output Requirements**: The problem requires returning "Dasha", "Masha", or "Equal" based on the visit frequencies, but the function returns an integer (the GCD) which does not fulfill the output requirements of the problem.

3. **Lack of Logic for Visit Frequency**: The program does not include any logic to determine the intervals at which Vasya would go to either girlfriend, which is crucial for solving the problem as described.

In conclusion, since the program does not accomplish the task of determining how often Vasya goes to Dasha versus Masha as specified in the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
