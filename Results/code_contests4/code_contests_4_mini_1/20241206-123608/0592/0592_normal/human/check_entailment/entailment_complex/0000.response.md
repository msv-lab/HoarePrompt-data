Correctness: **False**

The provided program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this does not solve the problem described, which is about determining which girlfriend Vasya visits more frequently based on the frequencies of the trains heading to Dasha and Masha.

The problem description requires a comparison of the frequencies of trains (denoted by `a` and `b`) and determining:
- If Vasya visits Dasha more often, print "Dasha".
- If Vasya visits Masha more often, print "Masha".
- If he visits both equally often, print "Equal".

The current program does not make any such comparisons or calculations regarding the frequencies of the trains. It simply calculates the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is irrelevant to the task at hand. 

For example, with inputs `a = 3` and `b = 7`, the program would compute their GCD (which is 1) but would not provide any information about how often Vasya would visit Dasha or Masha. 

This indicates that the program does not address the requirements of the problem as described, hence it is incorrect.
