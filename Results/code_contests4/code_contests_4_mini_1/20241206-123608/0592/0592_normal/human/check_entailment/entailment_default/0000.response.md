Let's analyze the given problem description and the provided code to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine which girlfriend Vasya will visit more often based on the frequency of trains going to each girlfriend's location. If trains arrive at different frequencies (a and b), we need to find out if Vasya goes to Dasha more often, Masha more often, or if he goes to both equally.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
g = a * b / func_1(a, b)
if g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1:
    print('Equal')
elif a < b:
    print('Dasha')
else:
    print('Masha')
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)
```

1. The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the GCD obtained from the `func_1` function, which implements the Euclidean algorithm.
2. The ratio `g / min(a, b)` and `g / max(a, b)` is used to determine if Vasya goes to both girlfriends equally often or more often to one over the other.
3. The conditions in the if-elif structure determine the output based on the comparison of these ratios.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
1. The condition `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` is meant to check for equal frequency. However, it relies on integer division, which can lead to incorrect results if not properly handled.
2. The logic for deciding whether to print "Dasha" or "Masha" is based solely on the values of `a` and `b` rather than the actual frequency with which Vasya visits each girlfriend, which could be misleading.
3. The program does not explicitly handle the case where the GCD might lead to an incorrect evaluation of `g`, particularly if `g` is not correctly calculated with respect to the frequencies of the trains.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe that the function computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm and seems to agree with the code's approach to determining the frequency with which Vasya visits each girlfriend. However, they do not clarify whether the ratio comparisons accurately lead to the expected outcomes described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the examination of both the code and the problem description, as well as the potential edge cases and issues identified, it appears that the code does not correctly handle all scenarios. The reliance on integer division and the condition checks could lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may not work correctly in cases where the calculation of `g` and the subsequent comparisons do not yield the correct representation of the visiting frequency to both girlfriends. For example, for inputs like `3` and `6`, the output might not reflect the equal frequency due to integer division miscalculations.
