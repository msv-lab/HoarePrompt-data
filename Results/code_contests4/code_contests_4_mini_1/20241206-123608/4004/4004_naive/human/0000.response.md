Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly prints 'YES' for vowels and 'NO' for consonants, while the problem description specifies that it should print 'vowel' for vowels and 'consonant' for consonants. For example, an input of 'a' should output 'vowel', but the program would output 'YES'. Similarly, an input of 'z' should output 'consonant', but the program would output 'NO'. Thus, it does not match the output requirements of the problem description.
