Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the output does not match the expected strings "vowel" or "consonant". Instead, the program prints "YES" for a vowel and "NO" for a consonant, which does not conform to the output specifications. 

For example:
- Input: `a` should output `vowel` but the program outputs `YES`.
- Input: `z` should output `consonant` but the program outputs `NO`.

Since the output does not align with the problem's requirements, the program is incorrect.
