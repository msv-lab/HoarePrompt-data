Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, the function must determine whether the input character `c` is a vowel and print "vowel" if it is, or "consonant" if it is not. 

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Output Strings**: The program outputs "YES" if the character is a vowel and "NO" if it is not. However, the problem description specifies that the outputs should be "vowel" and "consonant", respectively. This discrepancy in the output strings makes the program fail to meet the specified requirements.

2. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not compatible with Python 3. The correct function to use would be `input()`. Although this specific point may not affect the correctness in terms of logic, it does indicate that the program is not using the appropriate version of Python.

3. **Logic**: The logic for checking if the character is a vowel is correct and checks against the list of vowels. However, due to the output mismatch, it cannot be considered correct overall.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the problem description's requirements correctly.
