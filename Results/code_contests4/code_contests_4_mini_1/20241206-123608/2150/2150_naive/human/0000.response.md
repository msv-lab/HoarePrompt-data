To verify the correctness of the given Python program with respect to the problem description, I will analyze the program step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` which denotes the number of vertices in the tree.
   - It then reads `n-1` edges which connect the vertices, forming a tree structure.

2. **Checking for Odd Number of Vertices**:
   - The program first checks if `n` is odd. If it is, it immediately prints `-1` and exits. This is correct since a tree with an odd number of vertices cannot be split into even-sized components.

3. **Tree Traversal**:
   - The program defines a function `func_2` to perform a depth-first traversal of the tree starting from one of the leaves. 
   - It calculates the size of the subtree rooted at each node.

4. **Counting Removable Edges**:
   - After calculating the sizes of the subtrees, the program iterates over each edge and checks if the size of either connected component (subtree) is even.
   - If an edge connects two nodes where at least one of the connected components has an even size, it counts that edge as removable.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the count of removable edges.

### Potential Issue
Now, let's think about potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly:
- The program relies on the assumption that if an edge connects two nodes and at least one of those nodes has an even-sized subtree, that edge can be removed. However, it does not check if both sizes are even, which is necessary for both components to remain even-sized after the cut.
  
### Example Case
Consider a tree with the following edges:
```
1 -- 2
1 -- 3
2 -- 4
2 -- 5
```
This tree has 5 vertices, and it is impossible to remove any edges while keeping all components even-sized since removing any edge will lead to at least one component being odd-sized. The program would output `0` as removable edges because it doesn't check the overall structure correctly.

### Conclusion
The key flaw is that the code does not adequately ensure that all components remain even-sized after any edge removal. Therefore, it fails to handle some scenarios where no edges can be removed while satisfying the condition of even-sized components.

Correctness: **False**.
