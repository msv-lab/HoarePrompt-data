Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases specified by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to properly account for the scenario when the tree has an odd number of nodes.

### Reasoning:
1. The program first checks if `n % 2 == 1`. If so, it immediately returns `-1`, which is correct since you can't split an odd-sized tree into even-sized components.
2. However, when counting the sizes of the connected components after cutting edges, the logic appears flawed. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate the size of subtrees rooted at each node. It then checks if the size of each subtree (and thus the remaining part of the tree when an edge is cut) is even.

### Potential Test Case:
Consider a tree structured like this:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```
This tree has 5 nodes (an odd number), and according to the logic of the program, it will output `-1` immediately. However, if we take a different input, like:

```
4
1 2
1 3
3 4
```
This tree has 4 nodes (even). The correct behavior would be to check if edges can be cut such that all components remain even. The function may miscalculate due to incorrect logic in counting subtree sizes and might fail to return the maximum cuts correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program has flawed logic in handling the counting of sizes and the decision-making process on whether an edge can be cut. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem for all potential cases, leading to an overall incorrect implementation.
