The function accepts a positive integer `node` representing a node in a tree structure. It returns 0 if the `node` has already been seen (indicating it has been visited before). If the `node` has not been seen, it adds the `node` to a set of seen nodes, initializes its size to 1, then recursively calculates the size of the subtree rooted at `node` by summing the sizes of all its neighboring nodes in `E[node]`, and finally returns this size. The function effectively counts the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the given `node`.
