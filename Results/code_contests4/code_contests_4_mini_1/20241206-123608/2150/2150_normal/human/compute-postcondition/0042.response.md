The code `Q.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `Q`. The previous state indicates that `b` is the third element in `E[a]`. Thus, the list `Q` will now include `b` as its new last element. Other variables such as `a`, `cnt`, and `seen` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first element from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `seen` includes `a`, `E[a]` has at least 3 elements, and `b` is the third element in `E[a]`, with `b` now appended to `Q`.

Output State: **`a` is the first element from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `seen` includes `a`, `E[a]` has at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in `E[a]`, and `b` is appended to `Q`.**
