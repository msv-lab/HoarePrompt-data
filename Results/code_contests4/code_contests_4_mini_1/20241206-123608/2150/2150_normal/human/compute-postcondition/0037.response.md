According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the collection `E[a]`. The loop will execute if `E[a]` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `E[a]` has at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Before the loop starts, the state includes `a` being the first element from `Q`, `cnt` being incremented by 1, and `seen` including `a`. However, we also need to confirm the state of `E[a]` for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is the first element from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `seen` includes `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `E[a]` must have at least 1 element, and `b` is the first element in `E[a]`**
