According to the code, the loop continues executing as long as `Q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` has been modified to include all elements from `E[a]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must still contain at least one element. 

Since `a` is the first element from `Q` and the loop has operated on it, `Q` may be empty if there were no elements in `E[a]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, at least one element from `E[a]` should have been added to `Q` during the last iteration.

State: **`a` is the first element from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by the number of elements in `E[a]`, `seen` includes `a`, and for the loop to execute again `Q` must include at least one more element from `E[a]`**
