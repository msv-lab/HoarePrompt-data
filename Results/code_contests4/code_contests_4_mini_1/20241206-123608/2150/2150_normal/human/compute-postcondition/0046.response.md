The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. The parameter `a` is an integer that represents the number of vertices in the tree, constrained to the range (1 ≤ a ≤ 100000). The parameter `b` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (u, v) representing the edges between vertices, and the length of `b` is equal to a - 1. After executing the function body, the program returns the count of unique vertices that were traversed, represented by 'cnt'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `a` representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list `b` of edges, and return the count of unique vertices that were traversed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer a representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list of tuples b representing the edges between those vertices, and returns the count of unique vertices that were traversed.**
