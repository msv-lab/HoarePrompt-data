The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `node`. `node` represents a node in a tree structure defined by `n` positive integers, where `n` is between 1 and 100,000, and the input consists of `n - 1` pairs of integers (u, v) that represent edges of the tree. 

Based on the output conditions:
- If `node` has no neighbors (i.e., it is a leaf node), the function returns 0.
- If `node` has neighbors, the function returns the size of the node, which is calculated as 1 plus the sum of the return values of `func_2` for all its neighboring nodes in the tree.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a node in a tree and return the size of the subtree rooted at that node, where the size is defined as the count of nodes in that subtree. If the node has no children, it returns 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter node and returns 0 if node is a leaf. If node has neighbors, it returns the size of the subtree rooted at node, calculated as 1 plus the sum of sizes of all its neighboring nodes.**
