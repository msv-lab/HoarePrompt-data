Postcondition: ***`a` is assigned the value of the first element from `Q`, and `Q` is modified to remove that first element, maintaining its non-empty state for further loop execution. If `a` is in `seen`, the next iteration of the loop is continued; otherwise, the program proceeds without any specified action.***
