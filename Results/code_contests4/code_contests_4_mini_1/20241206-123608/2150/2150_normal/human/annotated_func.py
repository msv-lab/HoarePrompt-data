#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ a ≤ 100000), and b is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (u, v) representing the edges between vertices (1 ≤ u, v ≤ a) such that the length of b is a - 1.

    Q = deque()
    Q.append(a)

    cnt = 0
    while Q:
        a = Q.popleft()

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `Q` is empty, `seen` contains all vertices that were reachable from the initial vertices in `Q`, `cnt` is equal to the number of unique vertices that were traversed, `a` is the last vertex processed from `Q`, and `b` represents the last edges processed from `E[a]`.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the count of unique vertices that were traversed, represented by 'cnt'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges between those vertices. It returns the count of unique vertices that were traversed starting from the vertex `a`. However, the function currently does not properly initialize the edges (`E`) from the list of tuples `b`, which may lead to a NameError or incorrect results, as the edges are not defined in the function. Additionally, the parameter `seen` is incorrectly initialized as a set containing the entire list of edges instead of starting as an empty set. This could result in the function not counting any vertices if `a` is not in `seen`.

    for neigh in E[node]:
        print(neigh)
        
        sz[node] += func_2(neigh)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `node` is printed, `node` has been added to `seen`, `sz[node]` is equal to 1 plus the sum of the return values of `func_2` for all neighbors in `E[node]`, and `E[node]` contains all the neighbors of `node`.
    return sz[node]
    #The program returns the size of the node which is 1 plus the sum of the return values of func_2 for all its neighbors in E[node]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `node` representing a node in a tree structure. It returns 0 if the `node` has already been seen (indicating it has been visited before). If the `node` has not been seen, it adds the `node` to a set of seen nodes, initializes its size to 1, then recursively calculates the size of the subtree rooted at `node` by summing the sizes of all its neighboring nodes in `E[node]`, and finally returns this size. The function effectively counts the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the given `node`.
