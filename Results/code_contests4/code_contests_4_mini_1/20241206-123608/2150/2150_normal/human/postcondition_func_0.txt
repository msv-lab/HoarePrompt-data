The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of vertices in a tree and a list of tuples `b` representing the edges between those vertices. It returns the count of unique vertices that were traversed starting from the vertex `a`. However, the function currently does not properly initialize the edges (`E`) from the list of tuples `b`, which may lead to a NameError or incorrect results, as the edges are not defined in the function. Additionally, the parameter `seen` is incorrectly initialized as a set containing the entire list of edges instead of starting as an empty set. This could result in the function not counting any vertices if `a` is not in `seen`.
