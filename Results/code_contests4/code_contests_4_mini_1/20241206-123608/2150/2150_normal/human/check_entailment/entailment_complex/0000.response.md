Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Initialization of Edges (`E`)**: The function `func_1` mentions that it uses `E[a]` to access the edges, but `E` is never defined or initialized within the function or in the code provided. This will lead to a `NameError` and incorrect behavior.

2. **Logic for Counting Edges**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of edges that can be removed such that all remaining connected components have an even number of vertices. However, the function provided does not seem to implement this logic at all. The first function (`func_1`) is designed to count vertices but doesn't address the edge removal requirement.

3. **Handling of Even and Odd Vertices**: The problem states that if the total number of vertices `n` is odd, it is impossible to split the tree into components of even sizes. However, there is no check for the parity of `n` in the logic provided. If `n` is odd, the program should immediately return `-1`, but this check is missing.

4. **Logic in `func_2`**: The second function (`func_2`) appears to be focused on calculating the size of subtrees but lacks any mechanism to assess or return the number of edges that can be removed. Additionally, it uses a `seen` set to track visited nodes, but again, this does not contribute to solving the problem as specified.

Given these points, the code fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for several potential cases, particularly when `n` is odd or when the logic fails to calculate the edges correctly. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
