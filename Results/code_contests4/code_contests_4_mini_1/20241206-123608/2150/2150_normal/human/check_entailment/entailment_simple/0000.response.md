Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Understanding of Tree Structure**: The program lacks a clear mechanism to track and analyze the size of connected components after removing edges. The problem requires calculating the sizes of the connected components after edge removal and ensuring that all remaining components have even sizes. The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not seem to effectively manage this task.

2. **Edge Removal Logic**: The program does not incorporate any logic to determine which edges can be removed while ensuring that the remaining components are of even size. The problem description implies that there should be a specific method to decide which edges can be removed based on the sizes of the resulting components. The current implementation does not address this.

3. **Use of Global Variables**: The functions reference global variables like `seen`, `sz`, and `E`, but these are not initialized or defined in the provided code. This omission makes the program incomplete and non-functional as it does not have the necessary context or state management to perform its intended computations.

4. **Return Value**: The problem requires the output of the maximum number of edges that can be removed or -1 if impossible. The provided functions return sizes of nodes but do not calculate or return the number of removable edges.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 (which would return -1) or when all nodes are connected in such a way that no edges can be removed while leaving even-sized components.

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description as it lacks the necessary logic to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed while ensuring all components remain even-sized, and it improperly uses global state without initialization.
