To evaluate the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, let's analyze the functions and the hints.

### Problem Description Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed from a tree such that all remaining connected components have even sizes. 

### Function Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function attempts to traverse the tree starting from a given vertex `a`.
   - However, it does not initialize the edges (`E`) properly, which can lead to errors.
   - The `seen` set is mistakenly initialized with `b`, which is problematic because it should start empty.
   - This function, as it stands, cannot reliably count the vertices and will likely result in a NameError due to the uninitialized `E`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is intended to calculate the size of the subtree rooted at a given node.
   - It correctly initializes the `seen` set and the `sz` dictionary for counting subtree sizes.
   - It traverses the tree using recursion to count the number of nodes in each subtree.
   - Finally, it checks if the sizes of the subtrees can be used to count potential cuts.

### Output Hints Analysis
- **Output Hint for Function 1**: The hint is accurate in pointing out the issues with initialization and the potential for NameError.
- **Output Hint for Function 2**: This hint correctly describes the function's purpose and behavior, indicating it effectively counts the size of the subtree.

### Edge Cases Consideration
- If `n` (the number of vertices) is odd, the output must be `-1` since it is impossible to partition an odd-sized tree into components of even sizes.
- If `n` is 1, the tree has no edges to remove, so the output should be `0`.

### Conclusion
The first function, `func_1`, is not functioning correctly due to uninitialized variables, which would prevent the program from executing properly. This indicates that the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Additionally, the hints align with this assessment, emphasizing the issues with `func_1` and its inability to count correctly.

Given that the program does not follow the problem description correctly due to the flawed implementation in `func_1`, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
