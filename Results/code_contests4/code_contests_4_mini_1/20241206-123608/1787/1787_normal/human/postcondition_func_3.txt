The function reads a line of input containing multiple integers, splits the input into individual strings, converts them into integers, and returns a map object of these integers. This map object represents an array of positive integers, which are expected to be part of multiple test cases, but the function does not handle the entirety of those test cases or their lengths directly; it only processes the provided input as a single line.
