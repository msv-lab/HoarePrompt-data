To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over `Arr[1:]`, which means it will execute if `Arr` has more than one element (since `Arr[1:]` starts from the second element of the list).

2. The initial state indicates that `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. For the loop to execute, `Arr` must contain at least two elements (i.e., `Arr` must have at least one element at index 1).

3. The variable `T` being a non-zero integer, `n`, and `p` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the program state.

4. The variable `flag` is set to 0, which does not impact the loop's execution either.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `Arr` has at least two elements. Additionally, we need to define the state of the loop variable `i` when it first executes. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `Arr` must have at least two elements.
- When the loop executes for the first time, `i` will be equal to `Arr[1]`.

Combining all this information, the answer is:

State: **`T` is a non-zero integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 0, `i` is `Arr[1]` for the loop to execute the first time.**
