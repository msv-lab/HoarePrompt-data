The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decreased by 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the third element of `Arr`, and we break out of the loop that requires `i` not to equal `p`.
