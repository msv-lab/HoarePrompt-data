According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will continue executing as long as `T` is not zero (i.e., `T` must be greater than 0). At the end of the last iteration, `T` has been decreased by 1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must have been at least 1 before the decrement. Therefore, `T` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1 at the start of the loop.

Additionally, the other states (`n`, `Arr`, `p`, `flag`, and `i`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not directly affect the execution condition of the while loop.

State: **`T` is decreased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be at least 1**
