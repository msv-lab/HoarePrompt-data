`p` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `Arr`, which is `Arr[0]`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `Arr` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `p` will be determined by the value of `Arr[0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-zero integer; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`; `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`.

Output State: **`T` is a non-zero integer; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`; `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`; `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]**
