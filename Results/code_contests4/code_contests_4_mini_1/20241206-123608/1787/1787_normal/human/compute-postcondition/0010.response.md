Postcondition: ***`T` is a non-zero integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[1]`, and if `i` is not equal to `p`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
