The value of `Arr` is assigned the result of `func_5()`. The previous values of `T` and `n` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the new assignment of `Arr`. The previous values of `T` (decreased by 1) and `n` (assigned from `int(func_6())`) are still valid but unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is decreased by 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is assigned the result of `func_5()`**
