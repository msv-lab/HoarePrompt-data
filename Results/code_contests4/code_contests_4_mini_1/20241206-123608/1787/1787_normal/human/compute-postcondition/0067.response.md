The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decreased by 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, and `i` is the fourth element of `Arr`.
