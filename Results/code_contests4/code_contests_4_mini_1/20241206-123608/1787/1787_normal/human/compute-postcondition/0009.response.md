The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-zero integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is `Arr[1]`, and `i` is not equal to `p`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
