According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `T` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be adjusted back to its previous value, which is at least 2 (since it was decreased by 1 and it was originally non-zero).

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be at least 2**
