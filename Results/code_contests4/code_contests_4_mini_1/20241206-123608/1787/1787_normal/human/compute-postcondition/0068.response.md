Postcondition: ***`T` is decreased by 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, and `i` is the fourth element of `Arr`. If `i` is not equal to `p`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
