The variable `Arr` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_5()`. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-zero integer; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6()) and `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`.

Output State: **`T` is a non-zero integer; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`; `Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`**.
