Output State: **`T` is decreased by 1; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6());`; `Arr` contains at least 2 elements; `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`; if `flag` is 1, then the output is 1; otherwise, if `flag` is 0, then the output of `print(n)` is the value of `n`; `i` is assigned the value of the last checked element in `Arr[1:]` before breaking, if it did break.**
