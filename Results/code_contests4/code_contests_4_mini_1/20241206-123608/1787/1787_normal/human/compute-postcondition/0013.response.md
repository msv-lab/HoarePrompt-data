The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop where we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-zero integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is set to 1, `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
