Postcondition: ***`T` is a non-zero integer that has been decreased by 1 and is at least 2 for the loop to execute again; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6());` `Arr` contains at least 2 elements; `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`; if `flag` is 1 (indicating at least one element from `Arr[1:]` is different from `p`), then the output is 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 0 (indicating all elements from `Arr[1:]` are equal to `p`), then the output of `print(n)` is the value of `n`. Additionally, `i` is assigned the value of the last checked element in `Arr[1:]` before breaking, if it did break.***
