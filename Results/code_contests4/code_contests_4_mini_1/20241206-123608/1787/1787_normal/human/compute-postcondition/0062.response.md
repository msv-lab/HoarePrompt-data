Output State: **`T` is decreased by 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is the third element of `Arr`, and since the loop condition requires `i` not to equal `p`, the loop can execute one more time.**
