Postcondition: ***`T` is decreased by 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `i` is the last element of `Arr`. If `flag` is 1 indicating that at least one element in `Arr[1:]` is not equal to `p`, then `1` is printed. Otherwise, if `flag` is 0 indicating all elements in `Arr[1:]` are equal to `p`, then `n` is printed.***
