Postcondition: ***`T` is a non-zero integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`, `flag` is 0 (indicating that all elements in `Arr[1:]` are equal to `p`), `i` is assigned the last element of `Arr[1:]` if the loop executed fully.***
