The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a non-zero integer that has been decreased by 1 and is at least 2 for the loop to execute again; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6());`; `Arr` contains at least 3 elements; `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`; `flag` is set to 1; `i` is assigned the value of `Arr[2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
