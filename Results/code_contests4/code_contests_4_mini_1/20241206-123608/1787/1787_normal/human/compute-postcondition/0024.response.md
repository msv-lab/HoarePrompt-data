Postcondition: ***`T` is a non-zero integer, `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6())`, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, and `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`. If `flag` is 1, it indicates that there exists at least one element in `Arr[1:]` that is not equal to `p`, `i` is assigned the last element of `Arr[1:]` if the loop executed fully, and 1 is printed. If `flag` is 0, it indicates that all elements in `Arr[1:]` are equal to `p`, `i` is assigned the last element of `Arr[1:]`, and the value of `n` is printed.***
