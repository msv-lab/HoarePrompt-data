Output State: **`T` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be at least 2; `n` is assigned the value of `int(func_6());`; `Arr` contains at least 2 elements; `p` is assigned the value of `Arr[0]`; `flag` is 1; `i` is `Arr[1]` and `i` is not equal to `p` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
