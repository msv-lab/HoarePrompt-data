The input consists of multiple test cases, where t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the length of the password, followed by a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the contents of the password. The sum of n across all test cases will not exceed 200,000.
