The function processes multiple test cases where the first input is an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers. It checks if all the integers in the list are the same. If they are, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints `1`. The function effectively computes whether the list of integers consists of identical values or not, returning `n` for identical values and `1` for differing values.
