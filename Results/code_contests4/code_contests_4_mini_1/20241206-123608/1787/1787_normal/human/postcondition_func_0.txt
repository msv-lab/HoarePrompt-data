The function does not accept any parameters and returns two lists: 'fact' containing factorial values from 0! to 100004! computed modulo 'mod', and 'ifact' containing the modular inverses of these factorial values for n from 0 to 100004. The function ensures efficient computation of factorials and their inverses for later use, particularly in combinatorial calculations.
