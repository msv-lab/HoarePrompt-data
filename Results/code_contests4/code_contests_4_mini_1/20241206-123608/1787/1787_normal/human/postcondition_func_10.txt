The function accepts a list of tuples `P`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It calculates a value `ans` using the formula (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2, which is based on the integer `P` but does not actually utilize the contents of the tuples in any meaningful way. The function returns this calculated value `ans`, which is not directly related to the contents of the input list. Therefore, the actual output does not depend on the specific values in the tuples of `P`.
