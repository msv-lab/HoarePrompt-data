The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of positive integers `p`, and returns the result of calculating `n` raised to the power of `(p[i] - 2)` modulo `p[i]` for each element `p[i]` in the list `p`. However, it does not iterate through the list `p`, and it will raise an error since the code attempts to perform the power operation on `p` directly instead of each individual element. Thus, the function will not work as intended and will fail if `p` is a list.
