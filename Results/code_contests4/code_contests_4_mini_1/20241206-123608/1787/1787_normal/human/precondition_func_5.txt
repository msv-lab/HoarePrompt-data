The function will handle multiple test cases, where t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the initial contents of the password. The total sum of n across all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
