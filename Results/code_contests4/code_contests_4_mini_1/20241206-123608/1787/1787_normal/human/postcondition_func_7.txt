The function accepts an integer `x`, representing the number of test cases, and a list `y` of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the result of the expression `x` multiplied by `y` divided by the result of calling another function `func_7` with the same parameters `x` and `y`. The actual behavior of the function depends on the implementation of `func_7`, which may not be defined here, potentially leading to undefined behavior if `func_7` returns zero or a non-integer. Additionally, the multiplication of `x` with `y` may not yield the intended mathematical result since `y` is a list, which could lead to an error if not handled correctly.
