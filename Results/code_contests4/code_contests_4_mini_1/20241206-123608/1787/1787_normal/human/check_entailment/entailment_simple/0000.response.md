Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The problem requires an operation to be performed on an array of integers where adjacent elements that are not equal can be summed, reducing the array's size. The goal is to determine the shortest possible length of the array after performing these operations.

2. **Logic in `func_12`**: The main function (`func_12`) checks if all elements in the array `Arr` are equal. If they are, it prints `n` (the length of the array) since no operations can be performed. If any elements are not equal, it prints `1`, indicating that it is possible to reduce the array to one element. However, this logic does not accurately reflect the operations defined in the problem description:
   - The function simply checks for equality among elements and makes a decision based on that without considering the actual summation of adjacent elements. The operations allowed can lead to different outcomes, depending on the order of operations and the specific values in the array.

3. **Inefficiency in Handling Cases**: The program does not account for the iterative process of summing adjacent elements multiple times to find the shortest length. The requirement is to keep performing the operation until no further operations can be done, which is not implemented.

4. **Unrelated Functions**: Many functions in the provided code (like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) do not contribute to solving the problem as described and seem unrelated to the task of reducing the size of the array through summation operations.

In conclusion, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements as it does not properly implement the logic needed to compute the shortest possible length of the array after performing the defined operations.
