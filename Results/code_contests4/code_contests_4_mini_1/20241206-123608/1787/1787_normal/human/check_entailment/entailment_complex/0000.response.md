Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program is intended to find the shortest possible length of the password after applying operations on adjacent elements of the array. However, the logic in `func_12` only checks if all elements in the array are the same or not and returns `n` if they are the same and `1` otherwise. This does not align with the problem's requirement to calculate the minimum length of the array after performing the defined operations.

For instance, consider the input case where the array is `[2, 1, 3, 1]`. The expected output is `1` because we can perform operations to reduce the array to a single element. However, if we had an array where all elements are the same, such as `[420, 420]`, the implementation simply outputs `2`, which is correct, but does not provide the length after operations. 

Moreover, the program seems to ignore the operations that can be performed on the array entirely, which is a fundamental part of the problem. Thus, it does not account for the potential reductions in length that can be achieved through the defined operations, leading to incorrect outputs for many valid input cases. 

In summary, the program fails to implement the necessary logic to compute the minimum length of the array after performing the required operations, which is critical to solving the problem as described.
