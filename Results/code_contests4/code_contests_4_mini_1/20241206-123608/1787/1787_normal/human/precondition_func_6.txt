x is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and y is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, followed by n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial contents of the password. The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
