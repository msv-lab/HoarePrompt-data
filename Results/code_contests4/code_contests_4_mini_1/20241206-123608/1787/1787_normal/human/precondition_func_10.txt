P is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the password, and a list of n positive integers a (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the initial contents of the password. The length of all password contents across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
