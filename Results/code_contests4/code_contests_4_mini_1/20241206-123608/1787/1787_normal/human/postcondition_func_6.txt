The function accepts an integer `x` and a list `y` of tuples. It appears to attempt to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) between `x` and `y` using a while loop, but due to the way the loop is structured, it will not execute as expected because `y` is a list, and the operation `x % y` will raise an error. As a result, the function will not return the intended tuple list but will instead lead to a TypeError. Therefore, the function is incomplete and does not provide meaningful output.
