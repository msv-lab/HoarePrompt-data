Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases, with the first line containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case has a line with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), followed by a line with n positive integers a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
