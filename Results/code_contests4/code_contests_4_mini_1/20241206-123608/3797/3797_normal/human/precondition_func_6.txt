n is an integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, there are two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), followed by a string s of length |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) consisting only of characters . and X. The total length of all strings s across all queries does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
