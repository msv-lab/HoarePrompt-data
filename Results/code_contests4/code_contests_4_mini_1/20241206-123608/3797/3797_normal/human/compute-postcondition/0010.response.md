Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character including an additional 'X' at the end; `cnt` is 0; `this` is assigned the value 0; `flag` is False; `c` is the first character in `s`; `c` is 'X'; `this` is greater than 0; and either `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `this` is greater than or equal to `a + 4 * b - 1; an exception is raised due to the 'raise' statement.**
