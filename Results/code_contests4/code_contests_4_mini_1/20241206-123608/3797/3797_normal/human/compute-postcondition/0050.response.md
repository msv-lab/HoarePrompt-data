Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters with at least one more character after `c`, `c` is the next character in `s` after the current character processed; if `2 * b <= this`, and `this` is less than `a`, an exception is raised. If `this` is greater than or equal to `a`, the program continues without raising an exception.***
