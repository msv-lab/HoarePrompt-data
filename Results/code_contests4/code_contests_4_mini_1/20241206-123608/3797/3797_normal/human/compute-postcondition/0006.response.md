The loop repeatedly swaps the values of `x` and `y`, with the operation `x % y` being performed until `y` becomes empty. The `%` operator is not defined for lists, which causes the loop to terminate when `y` is empty. 

After the first execution of the loop, `x` becomes the original `y`, and `y` becomes the result of `x % y`. After the second execution, `x` becomes the result of the previous value of `y`, which is a list of tuples, and `y` becomes the result of applying the `%` operation on the new `x` (which is now a list of strings) and the original `y`.

Since the loop will continue until `y` is empty, we look at the state when the loop finally terminates. When `y` becomes an empty list, the loop stops executing. At this point, `x` will hold the last non-empty value of `y`, which was a list of tuples.

Output State: **`x` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `y` is an empty list.**
