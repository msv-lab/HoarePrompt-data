Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 1 character, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `c` is the first character in `s` and is equal to 'X'. `b` is less than or equal to `this / 2`, and `this` is greater than 0. Additionally, if `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or if `this` is greater than or equal to `a + 4 * b - 1, an exception is raised.***
