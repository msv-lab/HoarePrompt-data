The variable `this` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `a`, `b`, `q`, and `cnt` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt` are incremented by 1; `cnt` is further incremented by 1; `this` is 0.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt` are incremented by 1; `cnt` is further incremented by 1; `this` is 0**.
