Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 2 characters, `this` is 0, `flag` is True, and an exception is raised if `this` is less than `a` when `2 * b <= this`. If `c` is equal to '.', `this` is increased by 1 and `flag` is set based on the new character. If `c` is not equal to '.', `this`, `flag`, and other variables remain unchanged.***
