The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. The parameter `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `a` and `b` satisfying the condition \(1 \leq b < a \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). The parameter `r` is a list of strings, where each string consists of characters '.' and 'X' and has a length between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^5\). The total length of all strings in `r` does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

After executing the function body, it returns the result of dividing the sum of the list `x` and the total length of the list `r` (after subtracting 1) by the length of `r`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a list of tuples `x` containing integers and a list of strings `r`, then return a calculated value based on the sum of the tuples and the length of the strings in the list `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `x` and a list of strings `r`, and returns the result of dividing the sum of the elements in `x` (after adding the total length of `r` minus 1) by the length of `r.**
