Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters with at least one more character after `c`; if `c` is 'X' and `this` > 0, `cnt` is increased by 1 and `this` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `c` is a period ('.'), `this` is increased by 1; if `c` is not a period, `this` remains unchanged.***
