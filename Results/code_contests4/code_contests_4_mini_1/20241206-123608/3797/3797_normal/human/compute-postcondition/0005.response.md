The code attempts to assign `y` the value of `x` and `x % y`. However, since `x` is a list of strings and `y` is a list of tuples containing integers, the operation `x % y` is not a valid operation in Python. This results in an error during execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that the operation cannot be completed successfully.

Output State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'list' and 'list'**
