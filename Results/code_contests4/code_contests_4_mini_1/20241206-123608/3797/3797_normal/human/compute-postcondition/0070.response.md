The code snippet contains a `raise` statement, which is used to raise an exception in Python. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this code snippet. However, since the `raise` statement is executed, it indicates that an exception is raised, which would typically interrupt the normal flow of the program.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values from the function `func_3()`, `q` remains unchanged, `s` is a list of characters plus 'X', `cnt` is 0, `this` is 0, `flag` is False, `c` is 'X', `this` is greater than 0, and an exception is raised.
