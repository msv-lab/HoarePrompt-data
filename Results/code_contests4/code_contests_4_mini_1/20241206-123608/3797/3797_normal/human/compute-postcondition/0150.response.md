Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 2 characters, `this` is 1, `flag` is True or False depending on the new character, and `c` is the second character in `s`. If `b <= this < a` or `a + 4 * b - 1 <= this`, an exception is raised.***
