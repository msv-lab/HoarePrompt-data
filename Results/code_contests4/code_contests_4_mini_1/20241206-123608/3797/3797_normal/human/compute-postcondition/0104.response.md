Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt` are incremented by 1. If `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or if `this` is greater than or equal to `a + 4 * b - 1`, then `this` is set to 0, `flag` remains unchanged, and a raise is executed to interrupt the normal flow of the program.***
