Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters including the next character before the last 'X'; `c` is the next character in `s`; `cnt` remains 0; `this` can be 0 or updated to 1 if `c` is '.'; `flag` is True; an exception has been raised due to the raise statement. If `this` is less than `a`, the state remains unchanged as no else part exists.***
