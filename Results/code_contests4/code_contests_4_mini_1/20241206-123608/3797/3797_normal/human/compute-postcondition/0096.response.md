Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `q`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, and `flag` are variables with their respective values. If `2 * b` is less than or equal to `this`, and `flag` is true while `this` is less than `a`, an exception is raised, leaving all variables unchanged. Otherwise, the program continues without raising an exception, and the variables retain their original values.***
