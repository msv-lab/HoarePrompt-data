Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters with at least one more character after `c`, `c` is the next character in `s` after the current character processed. If `flag` is true, an exception is raised. If `flag` is false, the program continues without raising an exception.***
