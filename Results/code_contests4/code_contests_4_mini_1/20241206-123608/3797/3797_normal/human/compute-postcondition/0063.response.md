The value of `s` is modified by appending the character 'X' to the list. The values of `a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt`, `this`, and `flag` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values from the function `func_3()`; `q` remains unchanged; `s` is now a list of characters plus 'X'; `cnt` remains unchanged; `this` remains 0; `flag` remains True or False.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from the function `func_3()`; `q` remains unchanged; `s` is now a list of characters plus 'X'; `cnt` remains unchanged; `this` remains 0; `flag` remains True or False.**
