Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters including the next character before the last 'X'; `c` is the next character in `s`; `cnt` remains 0; `this` can be either 1 or updated from 1; `flag` is False. If `c` is '.', `this` is updated to 1 and retains its value; otherwise, there is no change as there is no else part.***
