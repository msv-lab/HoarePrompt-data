According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one element), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and it is stated that `y` is not empty (since it contains tuples). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must remain non-empty.

State: **`x` is a list of strings containing at least one string; `y` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers and for the loop to execute again `y` must remain non-empty**
