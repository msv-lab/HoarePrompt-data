Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters including the next character before the last 'X'; `c` is the next character in `s`. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, `cnt` is increased by 1, `this` is updated to 0, and `flag` is set to True, while an exception has been raised. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `this` can be either 1 or updated from 1, `flag` is False, and if `c` is '.', `this` is updated to 1; otherwise, there is no change.***
