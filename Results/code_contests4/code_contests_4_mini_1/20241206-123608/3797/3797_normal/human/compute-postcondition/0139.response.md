Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 1 character, `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is True, `c` is the first character in `s` and is equal to 'X', and an exception is raised because `flag` is True if `this` is less than `a`. There is no else part in the code.***
