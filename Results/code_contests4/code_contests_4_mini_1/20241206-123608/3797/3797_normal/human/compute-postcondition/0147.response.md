Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 1 character, `this` is 0, `flag` is True, and `c` is the first character in `s` which is equal to 'X' if the condition `c == 'X' and this > 0` holds true. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 1 character, `this` is 1, `flag` is False, and `c` is the first character in `s` which is '.' indicating that the condition `c == '.'` is met, while either `c` is not 'X' or `this` is less than or equal to 0 holds true.***
