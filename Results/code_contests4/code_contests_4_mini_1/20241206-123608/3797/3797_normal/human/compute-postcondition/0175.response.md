Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `cnt` are integers. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `a`, `b`, and `cnt` are increased by 1 and `this` is set to 0, while `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their values from `func_3()`, `cnt` is 2, and `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 3 characters. If `c` is '.', then `this` is updated to 1, and `flag` depends on the next character in `s`.***
