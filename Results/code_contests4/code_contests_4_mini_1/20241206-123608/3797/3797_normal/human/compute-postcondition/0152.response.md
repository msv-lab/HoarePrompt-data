Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 2 characters, `this` is 1, `flag` is True or False depending on the new character, and `c` is the second character in `s`. If `flag` is True, an exception is raised due to the condition being met. If `flag` is False, no exception is raised, and the program continues executing without interruption.***
