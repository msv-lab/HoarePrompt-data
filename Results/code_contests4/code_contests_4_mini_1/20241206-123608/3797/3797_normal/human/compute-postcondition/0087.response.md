Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `q`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, and `flag` are variables with their respective values. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `a`, `b`, `q`, `s`, and `cnt` are increased by 1, `this` is set to 0, and `flag` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` and `b` are reassigned values from the function `func_3()`, `q` remains unchanged, `s` is a list of characters plus 'X', `cnt` is reset to 0, `this` is set to 1, `flag` is False, and it is ensured that `c` is not 'X' or `this` is less than or equal to 0 while `c` is equal to '.'***
