Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `q`, `s`, `cnt`, `this` are variables with their respective values. If `c` is equal to '.', then `a`, `b`, `q`, `s`, `cnt`, and `this` are all incremented by 1, while `flag` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute a second time, `c` will be the next character in the list `s`, and the length of `s` must be greater than 1.***
