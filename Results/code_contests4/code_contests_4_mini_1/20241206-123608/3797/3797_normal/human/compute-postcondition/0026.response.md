Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character including an additional 'X' at the end; `cnt` is 0; `this` is 1; `flag` is False; `c` is the first character in `s`, and if `c` is equal to '.', then `this` is updated to 1. If `c` is not 'X', `this` can also be less than or equal to 0. There is no else part in the code.***
