The value of `this` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `this` is 0, so after execution, `this` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `b` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 1 character, `this` is 1, `flag` is False, `c` is '.', and either `c` is not 'X' or `this` is less than or equal to 0.
