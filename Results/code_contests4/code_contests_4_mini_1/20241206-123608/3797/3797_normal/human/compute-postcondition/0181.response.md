The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `q`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. The parameter `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 300,000. The parameters `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300,000. The parameter `s` is a string consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with a length of 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300,000. 

The function will process the inputs according to its internal logic, but the specific output based on these parameters has not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept these parameters and perform operations on them, leading to an unspecified output.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters q (an integer within 1 to 300,000), a (an integer greater than b and up to 300,000), b (an integer less than a and at least 1), and s (a string of '.' and 'X' with length from 1 to 300,000). The output is determined by the internal logic of the function.**
