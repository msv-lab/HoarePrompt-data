Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt` are incremented by 1. If `flag` is true, then `this` is set to 0, `flag` remains unchanged, and a raise is executed to interrupt the normal flow of the program. If `flag` is false, no changes occur in `this` or `flag` and the normal flow of the program continues.***
