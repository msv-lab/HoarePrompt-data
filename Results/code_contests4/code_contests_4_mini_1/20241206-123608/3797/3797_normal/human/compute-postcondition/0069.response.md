Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned values from the function `func_3()`, `q` remains unchanged, `s` is a list of characters plus 'X', `cnt` is 0, `this` is 0, `flag` is False, `c` is the first character in `s` which is 'X', `this` is greater than 0, and either `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `a` plus 4 times `b` minus 1 is less than or equal to `this`.***
