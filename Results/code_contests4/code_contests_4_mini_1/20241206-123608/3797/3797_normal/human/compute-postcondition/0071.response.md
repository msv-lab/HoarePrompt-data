Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned values from the function `func_3()`, `q` remains unchanged, `s` is a list of characters plus 'X', `cnt` is 0, `this` is 0, `flag` is False, and `c` is 'X'. If `b` is less than or equal to `this` which is greater than 0 and `this` is less than `a`, or `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this`, an exception is raised.***
