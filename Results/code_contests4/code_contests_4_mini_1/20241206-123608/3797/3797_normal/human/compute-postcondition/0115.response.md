Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt` are incremented by 1. If `c` is 'X' and `this` was greater than 0, then `this` is set to 0. If `c` is '.', `this` is set to 1 and the flag remains unchanged. If `c` is not '.', the values of `a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt`, `this`, and flag remain unchanged. In both cases, for the loop to execute a second time, the length of `s` must be greater than the current index + 1.***
