The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `a` and `b` that satisfy the constraints (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5). The parameter `y` is a list of strings `s`, where each string consists of characters `.` and `X`, and the length of both `x` and `y` is the same and does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 in total. After executing the function, it returns the list of tuples `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of tuples `x` and a list of strings `y`, and return the list of tuples `x` as output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `x` and a list of strings `y`, and returns the list of tuples `x`.**
