According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`, which is a list of characters from input with 'X' appended to it. For the loop to execute, the list `s` must have at least one character. At the start of the loop, the variable `c` will take on the values from the list `s`. 

Given that `this` is 0 and `flag` is False, they do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The key condition for the loop to execute is that `s` should not be empty.

Assuming that `s` contains at least one character (which is ensured by the fact that 'X' has been appended), the first character in the list will be assigned to `c`. 

State: **`a` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `b` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from input with at least 1 character, `this` is 0, `flag` is False, `c` is the first character in `s`**
