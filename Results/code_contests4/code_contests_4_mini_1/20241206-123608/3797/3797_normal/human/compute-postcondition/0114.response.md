Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt` are incremented by 1. If `c` is equal to '.', then `this` is set to 1 and the flag remains unchanged. For the loop to execute a second time, the length of `s` must be greater than the current index + 1. If `c` is not equal to '.', then the values of `a`, `b`, `q`, `cnt`, `this`, and flag remain unchanged, with the same condition for the loop to execute again.***
