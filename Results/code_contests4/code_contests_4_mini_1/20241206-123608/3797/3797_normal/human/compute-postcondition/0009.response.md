Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of tuples `x` containing integers and a list of strings `y`. It performs an operation that replaces `x` with `y` in each iteration, ultimately returning `x` unchanged as a list of tuples, while `y` becomes an empty list. This means the function returns the original list of tuples `x` regardless of the content of `y`.**
