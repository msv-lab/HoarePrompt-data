According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. Since `s` is a list of characters plus 'X', it will have at least one element. Therefore, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, the first character in `s` will be assigned to `c`, and `c` will be the first character in the list. 

State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values from the function `func_3()`, `q` remains unchanged, `s` is a list of characters plus 'X', `cnt` is 0, `this` is 0, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in `s`.**
