The program might raise an exception if any of the conditions that trigger a `raise` statement are met during the iteration over the list `s`. Specifically, this can occur if:
1. If a character `c` is 'X' and `this > 0`, the function checks the conditions involving `b` and `a`. If any of these conditions are satisfied, it raises an exception.
2. If `this < a` when `flag` is `True`, it also raises an exception.

If none of the conditions are met, the function counts the occurrences of 'X' in `s` and tracks the number of '.' characters. After processing all characters, it prints 'NO' if `cnt` is odd and 'YES' otherwise.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s`, `s` is a list of characters from input with 'X' appended to it, `this` is the total count of '.' characters in `s`, `flag` indicates whether the last character processed was 'X' with `this` greater than 0; 'NO' is printed if `cnt` is odd, otherwise 'YES' is printed. If an exception occurs, the output will be 'NO'.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `cnt` is the count of 'X' characters in `s`, `s` is a list of characters from input with 'X' appended to it, `this` is the total count of '.' characters in `s`, `flag` indicates whether the last character processed was 'X' with `this` greater than 0; 'NO' is printed if `cnt` is odd, otherwise 'YES' is printed. If an exception occurs, 'NO' is printed.**
