Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 300,000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `b` < `a` ≤ 300,000; `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character including an additional 'X' at the end; if `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, then `cnt` is 1, `this` remains 0, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `this` is updated to 1, `flag` is False, and if `c` is equal to '.', then `this` is updated to 1, while `this` can also be less than or equal to 0 if `c` is not 'X'.***
