f is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ f ≤ 300000); dim is a variable-length list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) followed by a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting of only characters . and X. The total length of all strings in dim does not exceed 300000.
