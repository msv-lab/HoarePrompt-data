The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. This is calculated by determining the bit length of `n - 1` and raising 2 to that power. It does not perform any checks for edge cases, such as when `n` is 0 or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior. If `n` is 1, it will return 1, as 2 raised to the power of 0 is 1.
