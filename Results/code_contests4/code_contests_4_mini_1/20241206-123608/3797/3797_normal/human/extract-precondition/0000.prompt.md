You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
Function definition:
```
def func_8(x, r):
```
