The function accepts a list of tuples `x` and a list of strings `r`, calculates the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `x`, adds the total length of the strings in `r` minus 1 to this sum, and divides the result by the length of `r`. It returns this computed value. However, there is a potential issue: if the length of `r` is 0, this will result in a division by zero error.
