q is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 300000) representing the number of queries; for each query, a and b are integers (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 300000) representing the lengths of substrings Alice and Bob must select, respectively; s is a string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 300000) consisting only of characters '.' and 'X', and the total length of all strings across all queries does not exceed 300000.
