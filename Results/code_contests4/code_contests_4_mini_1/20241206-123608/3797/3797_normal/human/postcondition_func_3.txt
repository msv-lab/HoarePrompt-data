The function accepts an integer `f`, which represents the number of queries, and a variable-length list `dim` containing tuples of integers and strings. If `dim` is empty, it returns the integer `f`. Otherwise, it returns a list created by recursively calling `func_4` with `f` and each tuple from `dim`, excluding the first element of `dim`, iterating based on `dim[0]`. However, the implementation may not handle cases where `dim` contains fewer elements than expected or if the tuples within `dim` do not match the expected structure, as there are no checks for these conditions.
