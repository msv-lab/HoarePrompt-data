The function accepts a list of tuples `l` and two integers `start` and `end`, returning a range object that starts from `start` and ends at `len(l) + end`. It does not perform any validation on the inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `start` or `end` are outside the expected range of values. Specifically, if `start` is greater than `len(l) + end`, the resulting range will be empty.
