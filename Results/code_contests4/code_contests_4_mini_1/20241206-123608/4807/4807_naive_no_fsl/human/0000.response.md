To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program must generate a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
2. No integer in the permutation should be in its original position (i.e., for all i from 1 to n, p[i] ≠ i).
3. The program should handle multiple test cases as specified by the input.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads an integer `a`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `b`, which is the length of the permutation to generate. 

The logic for generating permutations is somewhat convoluted:
- It initializes `s` to `b` and constructs a string `g` that is meant to hold the permutation.
- It has two while loops trying to generate the permutation based on whether `b` is even or odd.

### Issues Identified:
1. The logic within the `while` loops is not clear and does not systematically generate a valid permutation that meets the criteria.
2. The output string `g` is built but its contents do not guarantee that no integer will be in its original position (i.e., the condition `p_i ≠ i` is not guaranteed).
3. For small values of `n`, especially `n = 2`, the expected output should be `2 1`, which is a valid permutation. The provided logic does not clearly ensure this output.

### Test Case Example:
Let's consider a specific case where n = 3:
- A valid permutation could be `2 3 1`, which satisfies the condition.
- However, given the complexity of the string manipulation and the unclear logic, the program may not produce a valid permutation for this case.

### Conclusion:
The program lacks clarity and does not have a systematic approach to ensure that the permutation generated is valid for all cases. Thus, it is possible to construct cases where the output does not meet the requirement of the problem description.

**Correctness: False**

This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the program's logic does not ensure the output will always satisfy the required permutation conditions, especially for cases where `n` is small.
