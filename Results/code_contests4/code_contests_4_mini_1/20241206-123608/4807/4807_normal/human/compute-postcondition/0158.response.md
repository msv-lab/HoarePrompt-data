`g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`. The previous value of `g` is "1 ", and `s` is at least 2, so `str(s)` will convert the integer value of `s` to a string, resulting in a concatenated string. The exact value of `g` after execution will depend on the value of `s`, but it will always be "1 " followed by the string representation of `s`. The variable `b` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is at least 2; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is "1 " concatenated with str(s)**
