The variable `g` is updated by concatenating its previous value with the string representation of `s`. The specific values of `g` and `s` are not provided, but `g` being a string means that the result will still be a string. The impact of the code is that `g` will now contain its previous content followed by the string representation of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `g` is a string that is updated to be its previous value concatenated with `str(s)`.

Output State: **`g` is a string that is updated to be its previous value concatenated with `str(s)`**
