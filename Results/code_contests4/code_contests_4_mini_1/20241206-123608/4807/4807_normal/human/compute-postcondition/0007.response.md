The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(b)`. Since `g` is initially an empty string and `b` is an input integer, `g` will now contain the string representation of `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `b` is an input integer; `s` is assigned the value of `b`; `g` is now the string representation of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `b` is an input integer; `s` is assigned the value of `b`; `g` is now the string representation of `b`.**
