`g` is assigned the value of `g + str(s)`. Since `s` is an odd integer, `str(s)` converts `s` to its string representation and appends it to `g`. The previous value of `g` is a string with a space appended, so the updated `g` will now include the string representation of the odd integer `s` after the existing string in `g`. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is the updated string with the value of `s` appended after a space.

Output State: **`s` is an odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is the updated string with the value of `s` appended after a space.**
