The variable `g` is being concatenated with a space character. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `g`, and since the code only modifies `g` without affecting the other variables, we can only describe the change to `g`. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 2; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is now `g + ' '` (where `g` was previously unknown).

Output State: **`s` is at least 2; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is now `g + ' '` (where `g` was previously unknown)**
