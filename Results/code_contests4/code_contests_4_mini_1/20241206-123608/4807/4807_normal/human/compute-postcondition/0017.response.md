The value of `s` is decreased by 1. Given that `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, this means that after the execution, `s` can take on values from 2 down to 0, depending on its initial value. The values of `t`, `n`, `g`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the decrement of `s` and the conditions for the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is decreased by 1; `g` is assigned the value `g + str(s)`; `b` must be even**
