The variable `g` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `g` is a string representation of `b` followed by the string representations of all integers from `b - 1` down to 1, with spaces in between. However, this assignment overwrites `g` with an empty string, thus losing its previous value. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`s` is an input odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is an empty string**
