The value of `g` is concatenated with a space, but the previous value of `g` is unknown. The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is `b - 2`, `g` is concatenated with a space.

Output State: **`s` is `b - 2`, `g` is concatenated with a space**
