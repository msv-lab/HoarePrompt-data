The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is at least 2, after the operation, `s` will be at least 0. The values of `b` and `g` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 0; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is "1" concatenated with str(s).

Output State: **`s` is at least 0; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is "1" concatenated with str(s)**
