The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than 1 and equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `s` is now 0, and `g` includes the string representation of `s` with an additional space character, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
