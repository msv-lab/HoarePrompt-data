The value of `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. Since `s` is greater than 1 and equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `s` has a specific value but it is not provided. The previous value of `g` is also not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `g` is now `g` concatenated with the string form of `s`.

Output State: **`g` is updated to be `g` concatenated with str(s)**
