Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `b`. It generates a sequence of integers starting from `b` down to 1, with specific rules based on the parity of `b`. If `b` is even, it decrements by 1 until it reaches 1, and if `b` is odd, it includes the integer `b//2 + 1` in the sequence before continuing to decrement by 1. The generated sequence for each test case is printed as a string.**
