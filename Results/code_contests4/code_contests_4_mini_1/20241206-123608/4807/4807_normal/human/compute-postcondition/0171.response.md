The value of `s` is decremented by 2. Since `s` is at least -1, the new value of `s` will be at least -3. The variable `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The variable `g` is updated to include the string representation of the new value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least -3; `b` is odd; `g` includes the string representation of the updated value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is at least -3; `b` is odd; `g` includes the string representation of the updated value of `s`.**
