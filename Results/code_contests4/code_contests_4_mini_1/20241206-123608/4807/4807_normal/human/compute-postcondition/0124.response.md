The variable `g` is assigned an empty string. The previous state indicates that `g` contained a string representation of the odd integer `b` followed by spaces and the even integers from `b // 2 + 1` down to 2. However, the assignment of `g` to an empty string now overrides its previous value. The variable `s` remains unchanged, still holding the value of `b`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is an empty string**
