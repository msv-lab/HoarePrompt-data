In the given code, `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is at least -1, so `s - 1` will be at least -2. The string representation of `s - 1` will be either "-2" or a lower value depending on `s`. 

After executing the code, `g` will contain its previous value plus the string of `s`. The variable `b` is not affected by this operation, but since `b` is stated to be odd, we will keep that in mind.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the changes to `g` based on the concatenation:

Output State: **`s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`.**
