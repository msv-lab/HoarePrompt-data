The code `g = g + ' '` concatenates a space character to the existing value of `g`. The initial state indicates that `g` includes the string representation of `s - 1`, and since `s` is greater than 0, `g` is not empty. The value of `b` remains unchanged as an odd integer, and `s` also is not directly affected.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `g` with an additional space appended to it, while `s` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0; `b` remains an odd integer; `g` includes the string representation of `s - 1` followed by a space.**
