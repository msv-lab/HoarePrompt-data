The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the existing value of `g`. Since no value for `g` is provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. However, we can state that `g` will now include an additional space character. The other variables `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, and `g` is updated to include an additional space.

Output State: **`s` is now an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, and `g` is updated to include an additional space.**
