The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown as it was not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 0, `g` contains the string representation of the input odd integer `b` followed by spaces and the even integers from `b // 2 + 1` down to 2; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `g` contains the string representation of the input odd integer `b` followed by spaces and the even integers from `b // 2 + 1` down to 2; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
