The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(b)`. Since `g` is an empty string and `b` is assigned to `s`, the value of `g` will be updated to the string representation of `b`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `s` is assigned the value of `b`, and `g` will now hold the string representation of `b`. 

Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b`**
