The variable `g` is updated by concatenating a space character to its previous value. The previous value of `g` is not specified, so we can only state that it now includes an additional space. Other variables remain unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the previous value of `s` minus 1; `b` is an input odd integer; `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1; `g` has an additional space character.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the previous value of `s` minus 1; `b` is an input odd integer; `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1; `g` has an additional space character.**
