The code `i = i + 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables `s` and `g` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `i` without specifying its original value.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `g` contains the string representation of all odd integers down from `b` to 1 (if b > 1 and odd) or is "1" (if b is 1); `i` is increased by 1.**
