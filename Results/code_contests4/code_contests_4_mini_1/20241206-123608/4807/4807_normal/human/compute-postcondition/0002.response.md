The value of `i` is initialized to 0. Other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is an input integer; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is an input integer; `i` is 0**
