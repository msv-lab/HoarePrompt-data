Output State: **`s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `b // 2`, resulting in `g` being updated to include the value of `b // 2` after a space, and `g` is now equal to `g + str(s)`; `s` is decreased by 2.**
