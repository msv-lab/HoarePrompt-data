`g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s - 1` to its current value. Since `s` is greater than 0, `s - 1` will be either greater than or equal to 0. The state of `g` changes, but other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than 0 and now is either greater than 0 or equal to 0; `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 0 and now is either greater than 0 or equal to 0; `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s - 1**
