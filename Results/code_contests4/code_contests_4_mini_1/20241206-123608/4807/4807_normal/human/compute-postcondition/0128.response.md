The code `g = g + ' '` concatenates a space character to the existing value of `g`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `g`, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `g` is being modified to include an additional space. The values of other variables (`s` and `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `b - 1`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even; `g` is modified to include an additional space.**
