The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the current value of `g`. The other variables (`s`, `b`) remain unaffected by this operation. Since `s` is greater than 1, it does not equal 0, so the conditions regarding `b` and the exiting of the loop are not triggered. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `g` along with the unchanged values of `s` and `b`.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 1 and has been decremented by 1; `b` remains an odd integer; `g` is updated to `g + ' '`**.
