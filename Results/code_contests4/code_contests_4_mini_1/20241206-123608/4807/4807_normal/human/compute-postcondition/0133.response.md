The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g` concatenated with the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is `b - 1`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even. Therefore, `s` will be an integer value that is one less than an even integer greater than 1 (which will also be an integer). The original value of `g` is not explicitly given, but it is mentioned that it is appended with a space character initially. 

After the execution of the code, `g` will have an additional string representation of `s` concatenated to it. The output state reflects the new state of `g` after this concatenation. 

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 1`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even; `g` is updated to `g + str(s)`**
