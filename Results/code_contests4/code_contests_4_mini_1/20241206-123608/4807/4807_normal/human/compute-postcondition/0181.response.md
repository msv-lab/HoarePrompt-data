The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it has no input parameters specified in the definition. Instead, it operates on a predefined number of test cases, denoted by the integer `t`, which must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it processes an integer `n`, which must satisfy the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function does not specify a return value in this context. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to handle multiple test cases based on the constraints provided for `t` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, it handles an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).**
