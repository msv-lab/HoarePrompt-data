The variable `g` is updated by concatenating it with the string representation of `s`. Given that `s` is `b - 2`, the value of `str(s)` will be the string representation of the expression `b - 2`. Therefore, `g` will now contain its previous value plus the string representation of `s`. The other variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is `b - 2`, `g` is concatenated with `str(b - 2)`**
