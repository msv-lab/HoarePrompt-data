`g` is assigned the value of `g + ' '`, which appends a space character to the existing value of `g`. Since `g` is at least "1", it will change to "1 ". The states of `s` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 2; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is "1 ".
Output State: **`s` is at least 2; `b` remains odd and greater than 1; `g` is "1 "**
