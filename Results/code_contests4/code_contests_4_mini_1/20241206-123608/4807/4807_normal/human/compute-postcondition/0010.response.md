The variable `g` is being concatenated with a space character (' '), but there is no prior value assigned to `g` mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `g` is unknown, and it is being updated by appending a space to it. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is decremented by 1; `g` is updated by appending a space.**
