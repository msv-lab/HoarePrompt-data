The variable `g` is updated by concatenating it with `str(s)`. Since `s` is an even integer, `str(s)` will convert it to its string representation. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the new value of `g` after the concatenation while keeping the previous values of `s` and `b`.

Output State: **`s` is now an even integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is updated to include an additional space followed by the string representation of `s`.**
