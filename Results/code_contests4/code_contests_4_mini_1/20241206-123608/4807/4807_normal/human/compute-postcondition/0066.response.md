The variable `g` is assigned the value of `g + str(b)`. The initial value of `g` is an empty string, and `b` is an input odd integer. Therefore, `g` will now contain the string representation of the odd integer `b`. The value of `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is an input odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is the string representation of the input odd integer `b`**
