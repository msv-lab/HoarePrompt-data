The variable `g` is being concatenated with a space character (' '), but since there is no prior value given for `g`, we cannot determine its exact new value. The other variables `s` and `b` remain unchanged, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now an odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, and the value of `g` has been updated by appending a space.

Output State: **`s` is now an odd integer, `b` is an input odd integer, and `g` has been updated by appending a space.**
