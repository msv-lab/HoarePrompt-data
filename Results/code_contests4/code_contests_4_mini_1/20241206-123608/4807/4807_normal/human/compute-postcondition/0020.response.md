Output State: **`s` is 1 if `b` is even and initially greater than 1; `g` is the string representation of `b` followed by the string representations of all integers from `s` down to 1 separated by spaces. If `b` is odd, the loop does not execute and `s` remains equal to `b`, `g` remains as the string representation of `b`.**
