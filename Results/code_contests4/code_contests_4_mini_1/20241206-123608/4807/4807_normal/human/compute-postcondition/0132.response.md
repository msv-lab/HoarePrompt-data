The code `g = g + ' '` appends a space character to the existing value of `g`. The variable `g` is not mentioned in the initial state, which suggests it could hold any value. The previous value of `g` remains unchanged, and the state of `s` is also not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is equal to `b - 1`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even; `g` is appended with a space character.

Output State: **`s` is equal to `b - 1`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even; `g` is appended with a space character.**
