The value of `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s`, which is concatenated with a space. Since `s` is at least -1, `str(s)` will produce a string representation of that value, and the previous value of `g` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s` concatenated with a space.

Output State: **`s` is at least -1; `b` is odd; `g` is updated to include the string representation of `s` concatenated with a space.**
