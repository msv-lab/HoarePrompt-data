According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `b`. The condition for the loop execution is `s - 1 > 0` and `b % 2 == 1`. 

Right before the loop, `s` is 1, which means `s - 1` equals 0. Therefore, the condition `s - 1 > 0` is false, and the loop cannot execute. For the loop to execute at least one time, `s` needs to be greater than 1 (i.e., `s` should be at least 2). The variable `b` is an input odd integer, and it satisfies the condition `b % 2 == 1` as long as it is an odd integer. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s`, which must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. 

State: **`s` is greater than 1, `b` is an input odd integer**
