Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than 0, `b` remains an odd integer, and `g` includes the string representation of `s - 1`. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, then `g` is updated to the string representation of `s - 2 - 1` followed by two spaces and then followed by the string representation of `s - 2`.***
