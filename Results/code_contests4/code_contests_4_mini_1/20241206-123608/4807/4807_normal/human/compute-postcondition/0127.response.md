`The value of s` is decremented by 1. Since `s` was previously assigned the value of `b`, and for the loop to execute the first time `b` must be greater than 1 and even, `s` will now be less than `b`. The output state reflects the new value of `s` after decrementing it by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the value of `b - 1`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even.

Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `b - 1`, where `b` is greater than 1 and even**
