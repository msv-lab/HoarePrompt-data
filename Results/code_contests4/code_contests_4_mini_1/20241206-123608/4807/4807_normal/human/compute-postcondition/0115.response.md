Postcondition: ***`g` is a string that is updated to be its previous value concatenated with the string of `s - 1` and an additional space if `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`. In this case, `s` is decremented by 2, remaining greater than 1, and `b` continues to be odd. If `s` is 0, the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
