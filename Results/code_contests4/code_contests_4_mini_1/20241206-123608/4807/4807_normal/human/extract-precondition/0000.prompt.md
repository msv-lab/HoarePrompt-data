You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given one integer n (n > 1).

Recall that a permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation of length 5, but [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1, 3, 4] is also not a permutation (n = 3 but there is 4 in the array).

Your task is to find a permutation p of length n that there is no index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that p_i = i (so, for all i from 1 to n the condition p_i ≠ i should be satisfied).

You have to answer t independent test cases.

If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each n > 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the permutation you have to find.

Output

For each test case, print n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n — a permutation that there is no index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that p_i = i (so, for all i from 1 to n the condition p_i ≠ i should be satisfied).

If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each n > 1.
