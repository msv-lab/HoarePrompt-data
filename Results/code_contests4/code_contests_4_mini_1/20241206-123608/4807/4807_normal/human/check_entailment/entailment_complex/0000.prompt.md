You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given one integer n (n > 1).

Recall that a permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation of length 5, but [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1, 3, 4] is also not a permutation (n = 3 but there is 4 in the array).

Your task is to find a permutation p of length n that there is no index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that p_i = i (so, for all i from 1 to n the condition p_i ≠ i should be satisfied).

You have to answer t independent test cases.

If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each n > 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the permutation you have to find.

Output

For each test case, print n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n — a permutation that there is no index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that p_i = i (so, for all i from 1 to n the condition p_i ≠ i should be satisfied).

If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each n > 1.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func():
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    a = int(input())
    i = 0
    while i < a:
        b = int(input())
        
        s = b
        
        g = ''
        
        g = g + str(b)
        
        while s - 1 > 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            s = s - 1
            g = g + ' '
            g = g + str(s)
        
        while s - 1 > 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            s = s - 1
            if s == b // 2 + 1:
                g = g + ' '
                g = g + str(s - 1)
                g = g + ' '
                g = g + str(s)
                s = s - 2
            if s == 0:
                break
            g = g + ' '
            g = g + str(s)
        
        print(g)
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is equal to `a`, `s` is 0 for all iterations, `b` remains as the last input integer, and `g` contains the string representation of the last input integer `b` followed by the appropriate sequence of integers based on the parity of `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `b`. It generates a sequence of integers starting from `b` down to 1, with specific rules based on the parity of `b`. If `b` is even, it decrements by 1 until it reaches 1, and if `b` is odd, it includes the integer `b//2 + 1` in the sequence before continuing to decrement by 1. The generated sequence for each test case is printed as a string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
