The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires generating a permutation of integers from 1 to n such that no integer is in its original position (i.e., p_i ≠ i for all i). However, the code generates a sequence that counts down from the given integer b and does not ensure that the generated sequence meets the permutation criteria outlined in the problem description.

For example, if the input n is 3, the expected output should be a permutation like [2, 3, 1] or [3, 1, 2]. However, the code could generate a sequence like "3 2 1", which violates the condition that p_i ≠ i. The logic of the code does not create a valid permutation for all possible inputs within the specified range.

Additionally, the code's handling of even and odd integers creates further deviations from producing valid permutations. For any input, it does not guarantee the necessary properties of a permutation as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
