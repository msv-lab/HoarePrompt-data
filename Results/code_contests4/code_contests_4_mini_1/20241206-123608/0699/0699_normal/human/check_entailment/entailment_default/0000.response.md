The provided Python program is designed to compute the minimum and maximum beauty of an array as defined in the problem description. The beauty is calculated using the ceiling function on the elements divided by a given integer \( x \).

Upon examining the code, it performs the following operations:
1. It calculates the total sum of the elements in the list \( a \) and computes its integer division by \( x \) to find the minimal beauty.
2. It calculates the maximum beauty by summing the ceiling values of each element divided by \( x \).

### Initial Assessment
The program appears to handle the computations as described. However, an edge case arises regarding the calculation of the minimum beauty. The integer division of the total sum by \( x \) (`int(somme / x)`) does not account for the ceiling function, which is necessary for the minimal beauty calculation. According to the problem, the beauty of the array should be defined using the ceiling function, which means that if the total sum is not a perfect multiple of \( x \), the result should be rounded up.

### Edge Cases
1. If the sum of the elements in \( a \) is not divisible by \( x \), the program will produce a lower value than it should for the minimum beauty, because it uses integer division instead of applying the ceiling function.
2. For example, if \( a = [5, 5] \) and \( x = 6 \), the total sum is 10, and the minimum beauty should be \( \lceil 10/6 \rceil = 2 \). However, the program would output \( 10 // 6 = 1 \).

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints describe that the function prints the integer part of the total sum divided by \( x \) and the sum of the ceiling values. This aligns with the behavior of the code, but it also highlights the flaw in calculating the minimum beauty due to the lack of the ceiling function for the total sum.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description accurately for every potential case, specifically regarding the calculation of the minimum beauty when the total sum is not divisible by \( x \). Thus, there exists at least one case where the program will yield an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**.
