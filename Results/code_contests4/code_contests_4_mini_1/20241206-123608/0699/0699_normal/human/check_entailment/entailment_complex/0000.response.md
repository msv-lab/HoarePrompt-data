Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements set out in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Beauty**: The program calculates the minimum beauty by simply taking the integer part of the total sum of the array `a` divided by `x` (`int(somme / x)`). However, the minimum beauty should be calculated based on the sum of the elements when they are combined optimally. If two adjacent elements are combined, the resulting sum should be considered as a single element for the beauty calculation. The program does not account for this operation, leading to potentially incorrect minimum beauty values.

2. **Lack of Combination Logic**: The problem description allows for adjacent elements to be combined, which can significantly alter the resulting beauty. The program only calculates the beauty based on the original array without performing any operations to reduce its size or combine elements. This means that it fails to explore the combinations that could yield a lower beauty value.

3. **Maximum Beauty Calculation**: While the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by summing the ceiling of each element divided by `x`, it does not take into account that the maximum beauty can be obtained by leaving the array unchanged, which it does correctly at this point. However, this does not compensate for the incorrect minimum beauty calculation.

Overall, the program lacks the necessary logic to correctly determine both the minimum and maximum beauty as described in the problem statement, particularly regarding how to handle the combination of adjacent elements. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
