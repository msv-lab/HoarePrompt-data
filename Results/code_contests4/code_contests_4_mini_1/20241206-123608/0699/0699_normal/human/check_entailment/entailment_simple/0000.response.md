To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we can break down the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Operations on Array**: We can replace two adjacent elements with their sum, which reduces the size of the array.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: 
    - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the ceiling of each element divided by `x`.
    - We need to determine both the minimum and maximum beauty achievable after performing operations on the array.

### Expected Outputs
For each test case, we need to return two integers: 
- The minimum possible beauty after performing operations,
- The maximum possible beauty without any operations.

### Analysis of the Provided Code
1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(n, x, a)` takes the number of elements `n`, the divisor `x`, and the array `a`.
2. **Variables**:
   - `somme`: This variable calculates the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `mx`: This variable calculates the maximum beauty by summing up `math.ceil(a[i] / x)` for each element in `a`.

3. **Maximum Beauty Calculation**: The maximum beauty is correctly calculated as `mx` which sums the ceiling values of each element divided by `x`.

4. **Minimum Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to compute the minimum beauty by dividing the total sum `somme` by `x` and converting it to an integer. However, this does not account for the fact that the minimum beauty should also be computed using the ceiling function on the total sum divided by `x`.

### Issue Identified
The program incorrectly computes the minimum beauty. The line `int(somme / x)` should use the ceiling function to accurately reflect the minimum beauty, which can be expressed as:

```python
int(math.ceil(somme / x))
```

This would ensure that any fraction left from the division is rounded up, which is necessary for the beauty definition.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly calculate the minimum beauty according to the problem description, it fails to fulfill the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
