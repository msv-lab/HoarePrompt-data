According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, which ensures that it is at least 1. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop. 

Also, since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`, the first value of `i` when the loop executes will be 0. The variable `somme` is set to the sum of the list `a`, which is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop but indicates the cumulative value of the list elements. 

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1 and that `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
