To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the code snippet provided.

1. The function `reduce` is used here with a lambda function that sums the elements of the list `a`.
2. The initial value for the reduction is set to `0`.
3. The result of `reduce(lambda a, x: a + x, a, 0)` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

We denote the sum of the elements in `a` as `somme`. Since we know that `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, the value of `somme` will be a positive integer.

No other variables are affected by this operation, and the value of `mx` remains `0`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated sum of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a float representation of the initial positive integer value (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `mx` is 0, `somme` is sum(a)**.
