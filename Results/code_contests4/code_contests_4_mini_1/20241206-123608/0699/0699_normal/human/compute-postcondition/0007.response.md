According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2.

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` will be 2 before the next iteration starts). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
