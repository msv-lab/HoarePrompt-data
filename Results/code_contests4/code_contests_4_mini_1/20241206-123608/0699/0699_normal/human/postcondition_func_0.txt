The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `x`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It calculates the total sum of the elements in `a` and also computes the ceiling of the division of each element in `a` by `x`. Finally, it prints two values: the integer part of the total sum divided by `x` and the sum of the ceiling values. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
