To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: 
    - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
    - For each test case:
        - Two integers `n` (length of the array) and `x`.
        - An array `a` of `n` integers.
        
2. **Operations**: 
    - You can replace two adjacent elements with their sum.

3. **Beauty Definition**:
    - Maximum beauty is obtained by leaving the array unchanged.
    - Minimum beauty is calculated based on the sum of the entire array divided by `x`.

### Function Logic
- The function calculates:
    - `somme`, which is the total sum of the array `a`.
    - Maximum beauty (`mx`) as the sum of the ceiling of each element divided by `x`.

### Issues Identified
1. **Minimum Beauty Calculation**:
   - The minimum beauty is incorrectly calculated as `int(somme / x)`, which effectively uses floor division instead of the ceiling value. The minimum beauty should be calculated as `math.ceil(somme / x)` because the beauty function is defined with a ceiling operation.

2. **Maximum Beauty Calculation**:
   - The maximum beauty is correctly calculated as the sum of the ceilings of each individual element divided by `x`.

### Potential Test Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 3
3 6 9
```
Expected Output:
- Minimum beauty: `ceil((3 + 6 + 9) / 3) = ceil(18 / 3) = 6`
- Maximum beauty: `ceil(3 / 3) + ceil(6 / 3) + ceil(9 / 3) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`

However, if the function executes:
- It calculates minimum beauty as `int(18 / 3) = 6` (this is correct).
- It calculates maximum beauty as `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` (this is also correct).

Now let's consider:
```
1
1 2
5
```
Expected Output:
- Minimum beauty: `ceil(5 / 2) = 3`
- Maximum beauty: `ceil(5 / 2) = 3`

If we had an input with two elements:
```
1
2 2
5 5
```
Expected Output:
- Minimum beauty: `ceil((5 + 5) / 2) = ceil(10 / 2) = 5`
- Maximum beauty: `ceil(5 / 2) + ceil(5 / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6`

The function would output:
- Minimum beauty: `int(10 / 2) = 5` (this is correct).
- Maximum beauty: `3 + 3 = 6` (this is correct).

However, in both cases, the logic for minimum beauty is flawed because it should be using `ceil`, but the provided logic gives the correct result due to integer division and the specific cases of the inputs.

### Conclusion
Given that the minimum beauty calculation fails to always use ceiling division when needed and thus can lead to incorrect results in certain cases, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
