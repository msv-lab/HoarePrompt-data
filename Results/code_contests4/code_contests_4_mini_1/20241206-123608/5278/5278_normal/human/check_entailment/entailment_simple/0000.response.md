The provided program aims to determine the minimum value of the maximum load \( P \) that can be assigned to \( k \) trucks such that all \( n \) packages can be loaded onto the trucks without exceeding their maximum load. 

Here's an analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the inputs for \( n \) and \( k \), and subsequently reads \( n \) weights into the list \( w \).

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - It calculates the total weight (`sumW`) and identifies the maximum weight of a single package (`maxW`), which is essential for determining the minimum possible value of \( P \) since each truck must be able to carry at least the heaviest package.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If there is only one truck (`k == 1`), the only option is to load all packages into that truck, resulting in \( P = \text{sumW} \).
   - If the number of trucks equals the number of packages (`n == k`), each truck gets exactly one package, so \( P = \text{maxW} \).

4. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The program uses binary search to determine the minimum \( P \) that allows all packages to be loaded without exceeding the truck limit \( k \).
   - The search range is established between `maxW` and \( 100000 \times 10000 \) (the maximum possible weight sum).
   - During each iteration of the search, the program attempts to load the packages onto the trucks, counting how many trucks are needed if the maximum load is set to the current midpoint (`middle`).
   - If more trucks are required than available, it adjusts the search range to look for larger potential values of \( P \); otherwise, it tries smaller values.

5. **Final Output**: The program successfully calculates and outputs the minimum \( P \) that satisfies the loading conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It handles all edge cases appropriately and ensures that the loading constraints are respected while utilizing an efficient binary search approach to minimize the maximum load.

Correctness: **True**
