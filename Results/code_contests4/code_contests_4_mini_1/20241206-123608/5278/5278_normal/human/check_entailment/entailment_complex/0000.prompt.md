You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given $n$ packages of $w_i$ kg from a belt conveyor in order ($i = 0, 1, ... n-1$). You should load all packages onto $k$ trucks which have the common maximum load $P$. Each truck can load consecutive packages (more than or equals to zero) from the belt conveyor unless the total weights of the packages in the sequence does not exceed the maximum load $P$.

Write a program which reads $n$, $k$ and $w_i$, and reports the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor.

Constraints

* $1 \leq n \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq k \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq w_i \leq 10,000$

Input

In the first line, two integers $n$ and $k$ are given separated by a space character. In the following $n$ lines, $w_i$ are given respectively.

Output

Print the minimum value of $P$ in a line.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, and w_i is an integer such that 1 <= w_i <= 10,000 for each package. The first line of input contains the values of n and k, followed by n lines each containing the weight of a package.
def func():
    n, k = [int(val) for val in raw_input().split(' ')]
    w = []
    maxW = sumW = 0
    for i in range(n):
        num = int(raw_input())
        
        sumW += num
        
        w.append(num)
        
        if maxW < num:
            maxW = num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`.
    minP = 0
    if (1 == k) :
        minP = sumW
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            minP = maxW
        else :
            left = maxW
            right = 100000 * 10000
            while left <= right:
                middle = (left + right) // 2
                
                truckCnt = i = loadings = 0
                
                while i < n:
                    loadings += w[i]
                    if middle < loadings:
                        truckCnt += 1
                        if k < truckCnt + 1:
                            break
                        loadings = w[i]
                    i += 1
                
                if truckCnt + 1 <= k:
                    minP = middle
                
                if k < truckCnt + 1:
                    left = middle + 1
                else:
                    right = middle - 1
                
            #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `left` is greater than `right`, `minP` is the minimum capacity required for the trucks to carry the load, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is equal to the total load of the last segment of `w` processed, and `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks needed based on the loadings and `k` conditions.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers; `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; and `k` is not equal to 1. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `minP` is set to `maxW`. Otherwise, `minP` is the minimum capacity required for the trucks to carry the load, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is equal to the total load of the last segment of `w` processed, and `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks needed based on the loadings and `k` conditions.

If `k` is equal to 1, then `minP` is set to `sumW` and `k` is set to 1. If `k` is not equal to 1, and if `n` is equal to `k`, then `minP` is set to `maxW`. Otherwise, `minP` is the minimum capacity required for the trucks to carry the load, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is equal to the total load of the last segment of `w` processed, and `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks needed based on the loadings and `k` conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` (the number of packages) and `k` (the number of trucks), followed by `n` package weights. It calculates the maximum weight among the packages and the total weight of all packages. It then determines the minimum capacity required for the trucks to carry all packages based on the following conditions: if `k` is 1, the minimum capacity is the total weight; if `n` equals `k`, the minimum capacity is the maximum weight; otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows the packages to be distributed among the trucks without exceeding their count. If the distribution is not feasible, the function does not handle that case explicitly, potentially leading to unhandled scenarios.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
