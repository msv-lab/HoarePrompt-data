The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown, but it will now be one greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `loadings`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `loadings` is increased by `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1.**
