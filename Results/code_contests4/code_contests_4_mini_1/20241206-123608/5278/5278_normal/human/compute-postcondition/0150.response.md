Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (the number of packages) and `k` (the number of trucks), followed by `n` package weights. It calculates the maximum weight among the packages and the total weight of all packages. It then determines the minimum capacity required for the trucks to carry all packages based on the following conditions: if `k` is 1, the minimum capacity is the total weight; if `n` equals `k`, the minimum capacity is the maximum weight; otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows the packages to be distributed among the trucks without exceeding their count. If the distribution is not feasible, the function does not handle that case explicitly, potentially leading to unhandled scenarios. **
