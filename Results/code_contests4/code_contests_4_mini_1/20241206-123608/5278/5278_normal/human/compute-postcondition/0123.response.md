The value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `truckCnt` is increased by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **variable `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `loadings` is equal to `w[0] + w[1]`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1**
