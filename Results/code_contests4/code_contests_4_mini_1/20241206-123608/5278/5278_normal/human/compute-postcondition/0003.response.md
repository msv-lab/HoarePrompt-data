According to the code, the loop will execute for a range defined by the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, it is guaranteed to have at least one iteration. Therefore, the loop can execute without any adjustments needed for `n`. 

However, at the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. The current states of `k`, `w`, `maxW`, and `sumW` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they may be relevant within the loop body.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `i` is 0 for the first iteration**
