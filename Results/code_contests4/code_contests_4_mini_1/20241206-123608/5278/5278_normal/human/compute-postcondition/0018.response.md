The value of `sumW` is increased by `num`, which means that the new value of `sumW` will be the previous value plus the input integer `num`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `w`, `maxW`) remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `sumW` and maintains the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 2; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num`; `w` now contains `num`; `maxW` is updated if it was less than `num`.**
