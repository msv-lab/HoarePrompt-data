The value of `num` is appended to the list `w`. The variables `n`, `i`, and `sumW` remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num`; `w` now contains `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num`; `w` now contains `num**.
