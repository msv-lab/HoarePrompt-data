Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the total sum of relevant `w[i]` values accumulated until the loop condition failed, and `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed based on the loading conditions evaluated during the loop execution. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, then `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1.***
