Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the total sum of relevant `w[i]` values accumulated until the loop condition failed, and `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed based on the loading conditions evaluated during the loop execution. If `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, then `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`.***
