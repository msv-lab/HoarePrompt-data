`num` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and `num` will hold an integer value based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000; `i` is 0 for the first iteration; `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000; `i` is 0 for the first iteration; `num` is an input integer**
