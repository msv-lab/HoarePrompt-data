`sumW` is incremented by the value of `num`, which is an input integer. The previous value of `sumW` is unknown, and other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num**
