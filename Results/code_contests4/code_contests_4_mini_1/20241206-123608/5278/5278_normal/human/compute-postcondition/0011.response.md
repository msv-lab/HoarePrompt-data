The variable `num` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, but it does not change due to this line of code. The variable `i` remains 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer**
