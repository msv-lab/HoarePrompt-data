According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, and `n` is greater than this new value of `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than the updated `i`. 

Since `n` is already greater than the new value of `i`, no adjustments to `i` or `n` are necessary; the loop can already proceed one more time.

State: **`i` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`**
