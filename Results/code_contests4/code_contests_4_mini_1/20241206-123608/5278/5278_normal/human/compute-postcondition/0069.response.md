Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of the last segment of `w` that exceeded `middle`, and `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the load based on the values in `w`. If `truckCnt` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, and `left` is now `middle + 1`. Otherwise, `truckCnt` is less than or equal to `k`, `truckCnt + 1` is greater than `k`, and `right` is equal to `middle - 1.***
