The value of `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The previous state indicates that `loadings` was already increased by `w[i]`, but now it is reassigned to the current value of `w[i]`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `truckCnt`, and `k`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `loadings` is now `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` has been increased by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `loadings` is now `w[i]`, and `truckCnt` has been increased by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
