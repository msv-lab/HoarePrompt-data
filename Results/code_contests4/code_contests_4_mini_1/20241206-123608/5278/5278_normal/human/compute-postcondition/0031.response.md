The variable `right` is assigned the value `100000 * 10000`, which calculates to `1000000000`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; `minP` is 0; `k` is not equal to 1; and `n` is not equal to `k`; `left` is equal to `maxW`; `right` is 1000000000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; `minP` is 0; `k` is not equal to 1; and `n` is not equal to `k`; `left` is equal to `maxW`; `right` is 1000000000**.
