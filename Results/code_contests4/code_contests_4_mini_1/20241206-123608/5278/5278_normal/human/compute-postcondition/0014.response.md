The value of `maxW` is assigned the value of `num`. The value of `num` is an input integer, and it is also used to increase `sumW`. Therefore, `maxW` will now hold the value of that input integer. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `sumW`, and `w`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 1; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num`; `w` now contains `num`; `maxW` is `num`.**
