Postcondition: ***`i` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, and if `middle` is less than `loadings`, then `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the original conditions remain unchanged.***
