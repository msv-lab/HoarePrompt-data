Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `loadings` is equal to the total loading value based on the last index processed of `w`, and `truckCnt` is the count of trucks needed to carry the load based on the `middle` threshold and `k` conditions. The total number of trucks (`truckCnt`) plus one is greater than `k`.***
