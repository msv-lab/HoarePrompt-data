According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is between 1 and 100,000, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` becomes 2.

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 (because `i` will be 2). 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 2; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num`; `w` now contains `num`; if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
