The value of `minP` is assigned the value of `sumW`. The previous value of `minP` was 0, and it is now updated to the value of `sumW`, which is the sum of all integers in `w`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; `minP` is equal to `sumW`; and `k` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; `minP` is equal to `sumW`; and `k` is equal to 1.**
