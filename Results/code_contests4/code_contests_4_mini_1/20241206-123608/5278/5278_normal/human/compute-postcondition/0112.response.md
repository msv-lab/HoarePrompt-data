The value of `loadings` is incremented by `w[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, the value added to `loadings` is `w[0]`. The previous values of the variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the increment operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `loadings` is increased by `w[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `loadings` is increased by `w[0]**
