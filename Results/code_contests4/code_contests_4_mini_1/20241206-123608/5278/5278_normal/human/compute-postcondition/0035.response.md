According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000. Since `i` is currently 0, which is less than any valid value of `n` (which is at least 1), the loop can execute one time without any adjustments needed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `i` is 0**
