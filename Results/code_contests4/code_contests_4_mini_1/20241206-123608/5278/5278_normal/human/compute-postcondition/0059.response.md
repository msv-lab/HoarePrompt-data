Postcondition: ***`i` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, and `loadings` has been updated by adding `w[i]`. If `middle` is less than `loadings`, then `loadings` is now `w[i]`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
