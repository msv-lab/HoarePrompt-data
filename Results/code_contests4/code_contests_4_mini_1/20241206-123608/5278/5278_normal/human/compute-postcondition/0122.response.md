The variable `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`. The previous value of `loadings` is equal to `w[0]`, and `i` is currently 1. Therefore, after execution, `loadings` will be equal to `w[0] + w[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `loadings` is equal to `w[0] + w[1]`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `loadings` is equal to `w[0] + w[1]`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.**
