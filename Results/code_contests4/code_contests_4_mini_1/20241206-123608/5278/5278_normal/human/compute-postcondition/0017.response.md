The variable `num` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sumW`, `w`, `maxW`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `num` and retains the previous conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 2; `num` is an input integer; `sumW` is increased by `num`; `w` now contains `num`; if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
