Postcondition: ***After the execution of the program, `loadings` is updated to the value of `w[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than the updated value of `i`. Additionally, if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.***
