The variables `maxW` and `sumW` are both initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged, and the empty list `w` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000; `w` is an empty list; `maxW` is 0; `sumW` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000; `w` is an empty list; `maxW` is 0; `sumW` is 0**.
