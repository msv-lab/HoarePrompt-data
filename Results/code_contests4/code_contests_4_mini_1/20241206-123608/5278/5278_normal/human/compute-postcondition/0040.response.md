The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 0; `loadings` is increased by `w[0]`; `middle` is less than `loadings`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1; `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
