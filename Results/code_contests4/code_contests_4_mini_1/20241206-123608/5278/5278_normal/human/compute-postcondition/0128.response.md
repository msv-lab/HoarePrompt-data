Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `loadings` is equal to `w[0] + w[1]`, and if `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `loadings` is updated to `w[1]`, and if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.**
