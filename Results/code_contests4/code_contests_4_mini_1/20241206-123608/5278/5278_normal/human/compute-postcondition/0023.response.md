The variable `minP` is assigned the value of 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `w`, `sumW`, `maxW`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of those variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; `minP` is 0**.
