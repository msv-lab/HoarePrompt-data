The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the integers from the first line of input, where `raw_input()` accepts a string input which is then split into two parts and converted into integers. The values of `w_i` for the packages are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of the variables `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000**
