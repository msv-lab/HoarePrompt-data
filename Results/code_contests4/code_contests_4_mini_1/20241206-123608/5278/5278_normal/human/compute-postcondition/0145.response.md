Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `loadings` is equal to the total loading value based on the last index processed of `w`, `truckCnt` is the count of trucks needed to carry the load based on the `middle` threshold and `k` conditions. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then `left` is assigned the value `middle + 1`. Otherwise, `minP` retains its previous value and `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1.***
