According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
