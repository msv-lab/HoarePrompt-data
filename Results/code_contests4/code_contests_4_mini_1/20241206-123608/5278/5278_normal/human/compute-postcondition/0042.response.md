The variable `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The previous values indicate that `loadings` was increased by `w[0]`, and since `i` is currently 0, `loadings` will now be equal to `w[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 0; `loadings` is `w[0]`; `middle` is less than `loadings`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1; if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
