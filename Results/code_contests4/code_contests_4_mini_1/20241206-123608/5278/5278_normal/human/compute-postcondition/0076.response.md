In the given code, the value of `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `loadings` is increased by `w[0]` and `middle` is less than `loadings`, but these variables do not affect `truckCnt`. Therefore, the output state only reflects the change in `truckCnt`.

Output State: **`loadings` is increased by `w[0]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`; `truckCnt` is increased by 1**
