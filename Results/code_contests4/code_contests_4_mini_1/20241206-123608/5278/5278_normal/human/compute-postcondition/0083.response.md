According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 

If `i` was initially some value `x`, after being increased by 1, it is now `x + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`.

State: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the new value of `i` (which is increased by 1)**
