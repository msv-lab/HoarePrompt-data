The variable `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, which is the maximum integer in the list `w`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `w`, `sumW`, `minP`, `k`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; `minP` is 0; `k` is not equal to 1; and `n` is not equal to `k`; `left` is equal to `maxW`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers entered as input; `sumW` is equal to the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; `minP` is 0; `k` is not equal to 1; and `n` is not equal to `k`; `left` is equal to `maxW`.**
