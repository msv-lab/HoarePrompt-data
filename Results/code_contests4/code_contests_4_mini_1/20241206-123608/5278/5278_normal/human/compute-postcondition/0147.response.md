Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `w` is a list containing `n` integers; `sumW` is the sum of all integers in `w`; `maxW` is the maximum integer in `w`; and `k` is not equal to 1. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `minP` is set to `maxW`. Otherwise, `minP` is the minimum capacity required for the trucks to carry the load, `i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is equal to the total load of the last segment of `w` processed, and `truckCnt` is the total number of trucks needed based on the loadings and `k` conditions.***
