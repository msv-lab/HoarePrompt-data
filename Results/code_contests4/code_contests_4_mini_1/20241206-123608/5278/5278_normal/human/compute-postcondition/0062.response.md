Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `loadings` is the sum of the last segment of `w` that exceeded `middle`, `truckCnt` is the number of trucks needed to carry the load based on the values in `w`, `truckCnt` is less than or equal to `k - 1`, and `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. If `n` integers in `w` can all be loaded without exceeding `middle`, then `truckCnt` is equal to or less than `k`.***
