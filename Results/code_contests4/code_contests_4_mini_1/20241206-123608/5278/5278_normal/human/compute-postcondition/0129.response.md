According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

Since `i` is currently 1 greater than its previous value, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`. We can express this as `n` must be greater than `i`, which after the increment would mean `n` needs to be greater than `previous i + 1`.

State: **`i` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than current value of `i`**
