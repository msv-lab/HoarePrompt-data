The code appends the value of `num` to the list `w`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 0 for the first iteration. The variable `sumW` is also not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `num` has been added to the list `w`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100,000; `i` is 0 for the first iteration; `w` is updated by appending `num`.**
