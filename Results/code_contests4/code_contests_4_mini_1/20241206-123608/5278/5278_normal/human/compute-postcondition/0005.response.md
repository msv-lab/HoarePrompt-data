`sumW` is assigned the value of `sumW + num`. The value of `sumW` is not provided, but it is updated by adding `num`, which is an input integer. Other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000; `i` is 0 for the first iteration; `sumW` is updated by adding `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000; `i` is 0 for the first iteration; `sumW` is updated by adding `num**
