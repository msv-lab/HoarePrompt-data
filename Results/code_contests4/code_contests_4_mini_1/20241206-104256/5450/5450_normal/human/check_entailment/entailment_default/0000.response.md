The program is designed to read two integers, A and B, and perform operations based on whether A is a divisor of B. If A is a divisor of B, it prints A + B; otherwise, it prints B - A. 

Analyzing the code:
```python
list = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
if list[1] % list[0] == 0:
    print(list[0] + list[1])
else:
    print(list[1] - list[0])
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program correctly checks if B (list[1]) is divisible by A (list[0]) using the modulus operator.
2. If it is divisible, it prints the sum of A and B, which is correct according to the problem description.
3. If it is not divisible, it prints the difference B - A, which also aligns with the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- The input constraints specify that A and B must be positive integers with 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 20. Therefore, edge cases to consider would include:
  - The smallest values (A = 1, B = 1)
  - The largest allowed values (A = 20, B = 20)
  - Cases where A is a divisor of B (e.g., A = 4, B = 12)
  - Cases where A is not a divisor of B (e.g., A = 5, B = 12)

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function correctly identifies divisibility and prints the appropriate result based on that condition.

### Verification against Output Hints:
- The output hints align with the code's logic:
  - For inputs where B is divisible by A, the code correctly computes A + B.
  - For inputs where B is not divisible by A, the code correctly computes B - A.

### Conclusion:
In all cases defined by the problem description and the output hints, the code behaves as expected and produces the correct output. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to follow the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
