Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3. The correct function to read input in Python 3 is `input()`. This would lead to a `NameError` when the program is executed, making it impossible to test any cases.

Additionally, the program does not define the function `func()` as taking parameters to receive `A` and `B`, and instead relies on reading input directly from standard input. This limits its usability and does not align with common function design.

Even if the input reading was fixed, the logic inside the program correctly implements the problem description's requirements. It checks whether `A` (list[0]) is a divisor of `B` (list[1]) and then correctly computes either `A + B` or `B - A` based on that condition. However, due to the input reading method being incorrect for Python 3, the overall correctness fails. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements in a running state due to the input handling issue.
