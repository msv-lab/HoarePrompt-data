The function accepts two positive integers A and B, where 1 <= A <= B <= 20, and reads them from user input. If B is divisible by A, it prints the sum of A and B. If B is not divisible by A, it prints the difference between B and A. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results based on the divisibility condition.
