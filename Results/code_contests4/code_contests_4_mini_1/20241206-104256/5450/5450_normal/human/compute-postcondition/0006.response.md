The function `func` accepts two parameters: `A` and `B`. Both `A` and `B` are positive integers, with the constraints that \( 1 \leq A \leq B \leq 20 \). After executing the function body, the function processes these parameters to produce an output based on their values. However, the specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `A` and `B` that meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters A and B, which are positive integers satisfying 1 <= A <= B <= 20.**
