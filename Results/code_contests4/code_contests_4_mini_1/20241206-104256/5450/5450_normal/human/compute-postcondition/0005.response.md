Postcondition: ***`A` and `B` are positive integers such that 1 <= `A` <= `B` <= 20; `list` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the second element of `list` is divisible by the first element, the output is the sum of the first and second elements of `list`. Otherwise, the output is the difference between the second and first elements of `list`.***
