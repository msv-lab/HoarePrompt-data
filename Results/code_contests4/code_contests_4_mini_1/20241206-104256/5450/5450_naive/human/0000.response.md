Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if A is a divisor of B and prints the sum A + B if that condition is met. Otherwise, it prints B - A. The program adheres to all constraints and conditions outlined in the problem description.

To break it down:
- The input is read and split into a list of integers.
- The program checks if the second integer (B) is divisible by the first integer (A).
- It correctly performs the addition or subtraction based on the result of the divisibility check.

The code handles all edge cases dictated by the constraints (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 20), including when A and B are equal.

Examples provided in the problem description also return the expected results:
- For input `4 12`, it outputs `16` since 4 is a divisor of 12.
- For input `8 20`, it outputs `12` since 8 is not a divisor of 20.
- For input `1 1`, it outputs `2` since 1 is a divisor of 1.

Since all potential cases are handled correctly, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
