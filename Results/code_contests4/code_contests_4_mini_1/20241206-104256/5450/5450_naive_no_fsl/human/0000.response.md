Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads two integers, A and B, from the input.
2. It checks if A is a divisor of B using the condition `list[1] % list[0] == 0`.
3. If A is a divisor of B, it prints the sum `A + B`.
4. If A is not a divisor of B, it prints the difference `B - A`.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 20), all potential inputs fall within the specified range. 

Let's analyze the examples provided in the problem statement:

- For input `4 12`, since 4 is a divisor of 12, the output is `4 + 12 = 16`. This is correct.
- For input `8 20`, since 8 is not a divisor of 20, the output is `20 - 8 = 12`. This is correct.
- For input `1 1`, since 1 is a divisor of 1, the output is `1 + 1 = 2`. This is correct.

All possible combinations of A and B within the constraints have been considered, and the program behaves as expected in all cases. Therefore, there are no edge cases or missing logic, and the implementation adheres to the problem description perfectly. 

Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
