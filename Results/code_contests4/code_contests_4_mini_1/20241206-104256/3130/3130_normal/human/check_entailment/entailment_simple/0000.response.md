To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the function's logic and see if it accurately computes the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the given array.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers from input. This matches the problem description that requires an array of integers.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The list `out` is initialized with `-1` for each index, which will later store the distances to the nearest zero. This is appropriate as the output should represent distances.

3. **Queue for BFS**:
   - A deque (`que`) is used to perform a breadth-first search (BFS). The program enqueues positions of zeros with a distance of `0`, which is correct as these are the reference points for calculating distances.

4. **BFS Execution**:
   - The while loop processes each index in the queue:
     - For each index where a zero is found, it sets the corresponding distance in `out` if it hasn't been set already (`out[ix] != -1`).
     - It then attempts to enqueue the neighboring indices (both `ix + 1` and `ix - 1`) with an incremented distance (`lev + 1`).
     - Importantly, the condition `if out[ix] != -1:` is misplaced; it should instead check if `out[ix]` is still `-1` (unvisited) before setting the distance.

5. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The BFS will propagate distances from each zero outwards, ensuring that the nearest zero is always found before further distances are calculated. The BFS nature guarantees that once a distance is set, it will not be overwritten, thus providing the correct minimal distance.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is printed as a space-separated string of distances, which matches the required output format.

### Problematic Aspect:
- Due to the incorrect condition `if out[ix] != -1:`, the program might skip setting the distance for the first visit of the index `ix`, which leads to incorrect output for indices that have been visited multiple times.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to ensure that each index is assigned the minimum distance to the nearest zero because it checks for distances already set incorrectly. Therefore, it may yield incorrect results for some cases.

Correctness: **False**
