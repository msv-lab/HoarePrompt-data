The value of `que` is updated by appending the tuple (i, 0). Since `i` is 2, the tuple (2, 0) is added to `que`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, and `que` now contains the tuple (2, 0).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `que` contains the tuple (2, 0)**
