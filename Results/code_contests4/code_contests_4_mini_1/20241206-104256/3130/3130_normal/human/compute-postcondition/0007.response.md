The code appends a tuple `(i, 0)` to the list `que`. The value of `i` is 1, so the tuple that is appended is `(1, 0)`. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, and `que` now contains the tuple `(1, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `que` now contains the tuple (1, 0)**
