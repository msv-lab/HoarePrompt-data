According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `que` has one less tuple, which means it is not empty, thus the loop can still execute one more time.

Since there is no need to adjust any variables for the loop to execute again, we will repeat the program state as it is.

State: **`que` has one less tuple, `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple, `lev` is now 1, and if `out[ix]` is not -1, then `out[ix]` is set to 1. If `ix - 1` is within the range of 0 to `n - 1`, `que` now contains a new tuple (ix - 1, 2).**
