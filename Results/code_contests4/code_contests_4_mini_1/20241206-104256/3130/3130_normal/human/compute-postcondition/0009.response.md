According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. 

If `a[1]` is False, `que` now contains the tuple (1, 0). If `a[1]` is True, there is no change to `que`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, `i` will become 2 for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2, and if `a[2]` is False, `que` will contain the tuple (2, 0). If `a[2]` is True, there is no change to `que.**
