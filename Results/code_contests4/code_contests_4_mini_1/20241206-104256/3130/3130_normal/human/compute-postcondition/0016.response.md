The variable `out` at index `ix` is assigned the value of `lev`. Given that `lev` is 0, the value of `out[ix]` will be updated to 0. The other variables (`que`, `ix`, and `lev`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `que` now has one less tuple; `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple; `lev` is 0; and `out[ix]` is now 0.

Output State: **`que` now has one less tuple; `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple; `lev` is 0; and `out[ix]` is now 0.**
