According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0, since `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 up to `n - 1`. Additionally, the states of the variables `i` before the first execution of the loop need to be considered. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to the first value of the range, which is 0. 

The list `a` is not directly necessary for the loop to execute, but it should contain `n` integers as stated. The `out` list must also have `n` elements, which can be initialized to -1, and `que` being an empty deque does not affect the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `i` should be set to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
