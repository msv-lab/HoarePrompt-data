Postcondition: ***`que` has one less tuple and contains one more tuple if `out[ix]` is not equal to -1, where `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple and `lev` is the second element of the dequeued tuple. If `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, a new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1) is added to `que`. If `out[ix]` is equal to -1, the state of `que` remains unchanged with one less tuple.***
