`que` is updated by appending a new tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)`. The variable `ix` represents the first element of the dequeued tuple, and `lev` is the second element of that tuple. Therefore, the new tuple will contain the values `ix + 1` and `lev + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`que` now has one more tuple; `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple; `lev` is the second element of the dequeued tuple; `out[ix]` is assigned the value `lev`; the new tuple added to `que` is (ix + 1, lev + 1)**.
