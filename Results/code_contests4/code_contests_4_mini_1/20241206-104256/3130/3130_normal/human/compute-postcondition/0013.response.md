To determine what needs to be adjusted for the `while que:` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the state right before the loop.

In this case:
- `que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is 0.
- The loop condition `while que:` means that the loop will execute as long as `que` is not empty. 

If `que` is empty, the loop will not execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `que` must contain at least one tuple.

Given the description, `que` is populated with tuples `(i, 0)` for indices `i` where `a[i]` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, there must be at least one index in `a` where the value is 0.

Since `que` is not specified as empty in the provided state, we can assume that it should contain at least one tuple. If `que` currently has no tuples, we need to ensure that there is at least one index `i` such that `a[i]` is 0.

Thus, if `que` is empty currently, we must modify the state to ensure there's at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is 0.

State: **`que` contains at least one tuple `(i, 0)` for some index `i`, such that `a[i]` is 0**
