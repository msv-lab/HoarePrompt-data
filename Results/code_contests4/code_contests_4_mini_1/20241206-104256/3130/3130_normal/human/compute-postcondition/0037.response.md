The code appends a new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` to the deque `que`. The values of `ix` and `lev` are taken from the dequeued tuple, but the specific values of `ix` and `lev` are not provided. However, we know that `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple and `lev` is the second element. The other variables (`out`, `n`, and the state of `que` before this operation) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is: `que` has one more tuple; `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple; `lev` is the second element of the dequeued tuple; a new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1) is added to `que`.

Output State: **`que` has one more tuple; `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple; `lev` is the second element of the dequeued tuple; a new tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1) is added to `que`.**
