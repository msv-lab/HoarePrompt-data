Postcondition: ***`que` has one less tuple, `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple, `lev` is now 1, and if `out[ix]` is not -1, then `out[ix]` is set to 1. If `ix - 1` is within the range of 0 to `n - 1`, `que` now contains a new tuple (ix - 1, 2). If `ix - 1` is outside this range, the state remains unchanged.***
