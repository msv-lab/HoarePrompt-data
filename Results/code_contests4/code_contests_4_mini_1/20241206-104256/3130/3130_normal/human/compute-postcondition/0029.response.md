The code appends a new tuple to `que`. The new tuple consists of `ix - 1` and `lev + 1`. The value of `lev` is currently 1, so `lev + 1` will be 2. The value of `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple, and since `que` has one less tuple, we know it will now contain the new tuple `(ix - 1, 2)`. There are no other variables affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`que` now contains a new tuple (ix - 1, 2), `lev` is now 1, `out[ix]` is now 1**
