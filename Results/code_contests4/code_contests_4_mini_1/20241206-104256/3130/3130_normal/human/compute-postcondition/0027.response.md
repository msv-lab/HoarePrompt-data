The code appends a new tuple to the `que`. The new tuple consists of `ix + 1` and `lev + 1`. Given the initial state that `ix + 1` is between 0 and `n - 1` inclusive, this means the new first element of the tuple is valid within the boundaries of the range. Additionally, since `lev` is now 1, `lev + 1` will equal 2. Therefore, the new tuple that gets appended is `(ix + 1, 2)`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`que` has one less tuple; `ix` is now the first element of the dequeued tuple; `lev` is now 1; `out[ix]` is now 1; `que` now contains a new tuple (ix + 1, 2).**
