The function `func` accepts an input consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and each integer in the list must satisfy the constraint (-10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9). The list is guaranteed to contain at least one zero element. 

The functionality of the function is not explicitly provided in the output description, but we can summarize that it processes the input based on the constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a list of n integers, with constraints on their values, and the list must contain at least one zero element.**
