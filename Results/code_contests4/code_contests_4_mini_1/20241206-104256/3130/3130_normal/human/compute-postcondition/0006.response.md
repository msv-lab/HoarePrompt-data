According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
