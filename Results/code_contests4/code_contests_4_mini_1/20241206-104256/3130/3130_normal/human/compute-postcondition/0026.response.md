`out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`, which is 1. The previous state indicates that `out[ix]` was 0. The values of `que` and `ix` are not directly affected by this assignment, but the state of `out` at the index `ix` is now updated to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `que` has one less tuple, `ix` is now the first element of the dequeued tuple, `lev` is now 1, `out[ix]` is now 1, and `ix + 1` is between 0 and `n - 1` inclusive.

Output State: **`que` has one less tuple, `ix` is now the first element of the dequeued tuple, `lev` is now 1, `out[ix]` is now 1, and `ix + 1` is between 0 and `n - 1` inclusive.**
