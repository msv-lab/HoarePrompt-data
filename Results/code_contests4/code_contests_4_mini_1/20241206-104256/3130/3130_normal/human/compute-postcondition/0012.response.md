To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the initial conditions and how the loop operates based on the variable states.

The initial state has:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `out` is a list of `n` elements all set to -1.
- `que` is an empty deque.

The loop iterates through each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. In each iteration, if the value at index `i` of list `a` is 0 (considered as False), a tuple `(i, 0)` is appended to the deque `que`. If the value is non-zero (considered as True), `que` remains unchanged.

After all iterations of the loop:
- If `n` is greater than 0, `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`, and `que` will contain tuples corresponding to each index where `a[i]` is 0.
- If `a` contains all non-zero values, `que` will remain empty.
- If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `que` will remain empty.

Thus, the output state captures the final status of `que` after all iterations and the conditions under which they occurred.

Output State: **`que` contains tuples `(i, 0)` for each index `i` where `a[i]` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `i` is the final index value (n-1 or less), and `a` is a list of `n` integers.**
