The operation `ix, lev = que.popleft()` dequeues the first tuple from `que` and assigns its elements to `ix` and `lev`. Since `que` has one less tuple, `que` will now have one less tuple than before. The variables `ix` and `lev` will be updated to hold the first element of the dequeued tuple and the second element of the dequeued tuple, respectively. The previous state of `lev` is now overwritten by the new value from the dequeued tuple. The other variables (`out`, `n`, and `que`) remain affected only in terms of the count of the elements in `que`.

Output State: **`que` has one less tuple, `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple, `lev` is now the second element of the dequeued tuple**.
