Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, where the list must contain at least one zero. It computes the distance of each element in the list to the nearest zero and outputs these distances. If an element is a zero, its distance is 0. If there are no zeros to the left or right of a non-zero element, its distance remains -1. **
