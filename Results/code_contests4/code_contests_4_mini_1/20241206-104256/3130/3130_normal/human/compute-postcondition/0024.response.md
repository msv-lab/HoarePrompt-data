According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `que` has one more tuple, meaning it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`que` has one more tuple, `ix` is the first element of the dequeued tuple, `lev` is now 1, `out[ix]` remains 0, and `ix + 1` is between 0 and `n - 1` inclusive**.
