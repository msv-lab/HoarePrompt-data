The code initializes the variable `out` as a list containing `-1` repeated `n` times, where `n` is an input integer. The variable `que` is initialized as a deque (double-ended queue) from the collections module, which is an empty deque at this point. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `out` is a list of `n` elements all set to -1, and `que` is an empty deque.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `out` is a list of `n` elements all set to -1, `que` is an empty deque.**
