According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `N`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `N` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
