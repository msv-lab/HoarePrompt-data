The code `a += ')'` appends a closing parenthesis to the variable `a`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `a`, but it indicates that `N` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. The value of `a` is unknown in this context. However, since `a` is being modified, we note that `a` will now hold its previous value plus a closing parenthesis.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `a` is now appended with a closing parenthesis.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `a` is now appended with a closing parenthesis.**
