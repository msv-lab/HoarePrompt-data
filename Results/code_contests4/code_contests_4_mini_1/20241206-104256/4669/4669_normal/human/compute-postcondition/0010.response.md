The variable `s` is assigned the result of `s.split('()')`, which splits the string `s` at each occurrence of the substring `()`. This means that `s` will now be a list of substrings that were separated by `()`. The initial state of `N` and the initial string `S` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input string; `S` is a string containing at least one occurrence of `()`; `s` is now a list of substrings derived from the original string after splitting at `()`.

Output State: **`N` is an input string; `S` is a string containing at least one occurrence of `()`; `s` is now a list of substrings derived from the original string after splitting at `()`.**
