The variable `s` is assigned the result of `ss.split('()')`, which splits the string `ss` at each occurrence of the substring `()`. The values of `N` and `S` do not change, and since `ss` is an input string, the output will depend on its content. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an input string; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`; `s` is a list created by splitting `ss` at each occurrence of `()`. 

Output State: **`N` is an input string; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`; `s` is a list created by splitting `ss` at each occurrence of `()`.**
