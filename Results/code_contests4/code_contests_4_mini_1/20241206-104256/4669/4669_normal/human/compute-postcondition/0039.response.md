The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly since its definition does not include any input variables. However, it operates under the constraints that `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the specific return values or conditions under which they are returned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with the constraints of `N` as an integer and `S` as a string of parentheses, but it does not accept any parameters directly. 

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that N is an integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`, but does not accept parameters directly. The specific output is not defined.**
