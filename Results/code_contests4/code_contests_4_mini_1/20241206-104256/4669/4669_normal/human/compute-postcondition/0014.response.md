The code `s = s.split('()')` modifies the variable `s`, which is initially a concatenated string derived from `S` that contains at least one occurrence of `()`. The `split('()')` method splits the string `s` at each occurrence of `()`, resulting in a list of substrings. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `s` to be a list of the split components. 

Output State: **`N` is an input string; `S` is a string containing at least one occurrence of `()`; `s` is a list derived from splitting the original string on '()'**
