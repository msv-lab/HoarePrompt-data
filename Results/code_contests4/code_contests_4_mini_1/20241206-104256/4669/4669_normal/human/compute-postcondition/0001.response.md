`ss` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string. The previous states of `N` and `S` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input string; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`; `ss` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an input string; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`; `ss` is an input string.**
