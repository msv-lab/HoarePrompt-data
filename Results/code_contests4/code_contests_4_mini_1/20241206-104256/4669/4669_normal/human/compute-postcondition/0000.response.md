`N` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input string. Since `N` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, the output state is that `N` is now an input string that will later be converted to an integer. The string variable `S` remains unaffected at this stage. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input string; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`.

Output State: **`N` is an input string; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters `(` and `)`**
