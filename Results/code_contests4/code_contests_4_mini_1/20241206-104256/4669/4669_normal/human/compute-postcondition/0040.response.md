Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer N and a string S of length N consisting of the characters `(` and `)`. It reduces S by repeatedly removing adjacent pairs of `()` until no more pairs can be removed. Then, it counts the number of unmatched `(` and `)` in the resulting string and constructs a new string that consists of the unmatched `)` followed by the original input string S, followed by the unmatched `(`. The final output is printed but not returned, and the function does not handle potential edge cases related to invalid input. **
