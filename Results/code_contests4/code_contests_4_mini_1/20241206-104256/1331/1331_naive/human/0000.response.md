Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement any logic to fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it lacks any defined operations to generate pairs of indices for sorting the given arrays. 

To illustrate a case where the program fails:
- If we input the following:
  ```
  2 5 0
  3 1 2 5 4
  4 1 3 2 5
  ```
  The expected output should be a series of index pairs that can sort both arrays in ascending order. However, since the function `func_1` does nothing (it only has a `pass` statement), it will not produce any output, hence failing to meet the problem requirements.

Since the program does not perform any operations or produce the necessary output, it does not handle any potential input cases correctly. Thus, it is incorrect.
