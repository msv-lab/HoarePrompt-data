Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the provided function `func_1()` is simply a placeholder that does not contain any logic to process the input arrays or sort them according to the specified order (ascending or descending). The problem description requires the function to generate an array of pairs of distinct indices that can be used to sort the given arrays by swapping the elements at those indices. However, since the function does not implement any functionality, it fails to fulfill the requirements of the problem.

Specifically, the function does not:
- Accept or process the input arrays.
- Generate the necessary pairs of indices for swapping elements.
- Ensure that the arrays are sorted in the specified order.

Therefore, it does not meet the problem's requirements for any potential case, and thus the correctness is determined to be **False**.
