The provided program is a placeholder function that does not contain any logic to process or sort the integers as described in the problem statement. The problem requires the implementation of a function that sorts multiple arrays according to the specified order (ascending or descending) through a series of index swaps. However, since the function `func_1()` is defined with only a `pass` statement, it does not perform any operations or produce any output.

The problem description outlines the need to sort arrays based on given pairs of indices, but the program does not implement this functionality at all. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem.

Furthermore, the output hints confirm that the function has no implemented logic, stating that it "does not return any sorted integers or handle any input." This reinforces the fact that the code does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for any potential case, it is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
