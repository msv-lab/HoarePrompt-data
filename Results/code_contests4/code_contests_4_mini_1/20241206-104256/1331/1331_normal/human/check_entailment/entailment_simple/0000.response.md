Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not implement any functionality. The function `func_1()` is defined but only contains a `pass` statement, which means it does nothing. The problem description requires the program to generate a series of index pairs that can be used to sort multiple arrays based on a given order (ascending or descending). Since there is no logic present in the program to perform the required sorting or to generate the index pairs, it does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.

In essence, the program lacks all necessary components for reading input, processing the arrays, generating the appropriate index pairs, and outputting the result. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.
