#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 100), and k is an integer (0 or 1) indicating the sort order (0 for ascending and 1 for descending). Each of the next n lines contains m integers where each integer x satisfies 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` (the number of lines), a positive integer `m` (the number of integers per line), and an integer `k` (indicating the sort order: 0 for ascending and 1 for descending). However, the function does not implement any logic to process or sort the integers, as it is currently a placeholder with no functionality. Therefore, it does not return any sorted integers or handle any input, and its intended functionality is not realized.
