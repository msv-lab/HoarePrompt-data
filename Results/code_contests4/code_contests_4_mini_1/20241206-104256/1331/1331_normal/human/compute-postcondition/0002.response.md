Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` (the number of lines), a positive integer `m` (the number of integers per line), and an integer `k` (indicating the sort order: 0 for ascending and 1 for descending). However, the function does not implement any logic to process or sort the integers, as it is currently a placeholder with no functionality. Therefore, it does not return any sorted integers or handle any input, and its intended functionality is not realized. **
