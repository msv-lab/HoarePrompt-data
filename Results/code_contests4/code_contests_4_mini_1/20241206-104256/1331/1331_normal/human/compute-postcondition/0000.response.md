The code `pass` does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state in any way. Therefore, the Output State remains the same with the initial values of the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (0 or 1) indicating the sort order (0 for ascending and 1 for descending), and the next `n` lines contain `m` integers each, with each integer `x` satisfying 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^6.**
