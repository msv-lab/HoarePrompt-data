The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of lines of input, constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `m` is a positive integer that represents the number of integers in each line of input, constrained to the range 1 ≤ m ≤ 100.
- `k` is an integer that indicates the sort order, where 0 represents ascending order and 1 represents descending order.

After executing the function body, it processes `n` lines of `m` integers, each integer `x` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^6, and returns a sorted list of these integers based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the integers are returned in ascending order; if `k` is 1, they are returned in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and k, processes n lines of m integers, and returns the integers sorted in ascending order if k is 0, and in descending order if k is 1.**
