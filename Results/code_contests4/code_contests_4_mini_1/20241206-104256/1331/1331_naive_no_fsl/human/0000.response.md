Correctness: **False**

The provided program consists solely of a placeholder function `func_1()` with no implemented logic. According to the problem description, the task is to generate a series of index pairs that can be used to sort multiple arrays based on given conditions (ascending or descending order). Since the function does not contain any code to perform this sorting or generate the required index pairs, it cannot handle any input, nor can it produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.

For example, if we run the input:

```
2 5 0
1 3 2 5 4
1 4 3 2 5
```

The expected output should include pairs of indices that will lead to sorting the provided arrays in ascending order. The lack of implementation means that no output will be produced, hence the program fails to fulfill the requirements of the task in every potential case.
