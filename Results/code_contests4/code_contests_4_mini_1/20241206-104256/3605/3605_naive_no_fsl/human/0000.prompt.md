You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x(x > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1 000 000) — The coordinate of the friend's house.

Output

Print the minimum number of steps that elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x.

Examples

Input

5


Output

1


Input

12


Output

3

Note

In the first sample the elephant needs to make one step of length 5 to reach the point x.

In the second sample the elephant can get to point x if he moves by 3, 5 and 4. There are other ways to get the optimal answer but the elephant cannot reach x in less than three moves.
Program:
```
print(input() + 4) / 5
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
