Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program attempts to read input and expects an integer `x` (the position of the friend's house). However, the line `print(input() + 4) / 5` does not convert the input into an integer, which will lead to a TypeError when trying to perform arithmetic operations.

2. **Logic**: The logic used in the function is flawed. The expression `input() + 4` simply adds 4 to the raw input string instead of calculating the number of steps. The problem states that the elephant can move between 1 and 5 positions in one step. Therefore, to determine the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to take to reach `x`, the correct logic would involve using integer division to divide `x` by 5. If there is a remainder when dividing by 5, it indicates that an additional step is needed.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the result of an incorrect calculation. The expected output is the minimum number of steps, not the result of the erroneous expression provided.

To summarize, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of steps needed for the elephant to reach his friend's house at position `x`. Instead, it attempts to perform a faulty calculation that does not align with the requirements of the problem.
