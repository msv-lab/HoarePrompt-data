Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The logic used in the function is flawed. The expression `print(input() + 4) / 5` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach his friend's house at point `x`. Instead, it attempts to add 4 to the input value and then divide by 5, which does not reflect the proper calculation needed to determine the minimum steps.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using `input()`, but it does not convert this input to an integer. The input should be explicitly converted to an integer type to match the requirements specified in the problem description. If a non-numeric value is entered, it will lead to a runtime error.

3. **Lack of Return Value**: The function does not return any value. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum number of steps, which means the function should return this value rather than printing it.

4. **Logic for Steps**: The correct logic to determine the minimum steps should involve dividing `x` directly by 5 (the maximum step size) and handling any remainder appropriately. The program currently does not implement this logic.

In summary, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach point `x`, does not handle input correctly, and does not return the expected output.
