#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1,000,000.
def func():
    print(input() + 4) / 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for input, adds 4 to that input, and attempts to divide the result by 5. However, the function does not return any value, and there is a potential issue if the input is not a numeric value, which could lead to a runtime error.
