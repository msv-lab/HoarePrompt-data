Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get to his friend's house located at point x. 

The program currently performs the following operation:
```python
print(input() + 4) / 5
```
This line attempts to add 4 to the input (which is a string) before performing a division by 5, which is not the intended logic. 

Here’s the logic that is expected:
- If the elephant can move 1 to 5 positions in one step, to find the minimum number of steps to reach x, we need to calculate how many full 5-position steps he can take, and if there’s any remainder, that would require an additional step.

For example:
- If x = 12, the correct calculation would be:
  - 12 // 5 = 2 full steps of 5 (which covers 10 units), leaving 2 units remaining.
  - Since 2 is less than or equal to 5, that would require 1 additional step.
  - Therefore, the total would be 3 steps.

However, the given program does not accurately implement this logic and will produce incorrect results for various values of x, such as x = 12 or x = 7. 

In both cases, the output would not reflect the correct minimum number of steps needed.
