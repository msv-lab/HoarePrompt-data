Correctness: **False**.

The provided program only reads the input values but does not implement any logic to count the integers \( x \) in the range \([a; b]\) that satisfy the given condition \( f(x) = x \) for at least 7 permutations of the numbers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \). It fails to address the core requirement of the problem statement, which is to compute and output the count of such integers. 

For example, if the input is `2 7 1 8 2 8`, the program should output `0`, but it does not perform any calculations to determine that. It simply takes the input and ends without producing any relevant output. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem.
