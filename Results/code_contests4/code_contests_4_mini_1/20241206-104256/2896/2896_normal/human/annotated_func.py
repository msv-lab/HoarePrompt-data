#State of the program right berfore the function call: p1, p2, p3, and p4 are distinct integers in the range [1, 1000]; a and b are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a <= b <= 31415.
def func():
    p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts distinct integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4` in the range [1, 1000] and non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that `0 <= a <= b <= 31415` from user input. It does not return any value or perform any operations beyond collecting this input.
