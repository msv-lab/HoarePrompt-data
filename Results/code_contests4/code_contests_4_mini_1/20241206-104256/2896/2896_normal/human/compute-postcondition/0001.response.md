The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraints that `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` are distinct integers in the range [1, 1000], and `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a <= b <= 31415. The specific output of the function is not provided in the prompt, so we cannot determine the exact return values or conditions for output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the constraints of distinct integers p1, p2, p3, p4 in the range [1, 1000] and non-negative integers a and b within specified limits. The return value is not specified.**
