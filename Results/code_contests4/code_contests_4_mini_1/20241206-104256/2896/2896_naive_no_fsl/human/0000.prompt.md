You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Petya was given this problem for homework:

You are given function <image> (here <image> represents the operation of taking the remainder). His task is to count the number of integers x in range [a;b] with property f(x) = x.

It is a pity that Petya forgot the order in which the remainders should be taken and wrote down only 4 numbers. Each of 24 possible orders of taking the remainder has equal probability of being chosen. For example, if Petya has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 then he can take remainders in that order or first take remainder modulo 4, then modulo 2, 3, 1. There also are 22 other permutations of these numbers that represent orders in which remainder can be taken. In this problem 4 numbers wrote down by Petya will be pairwise distinct.

Now it is impossible for Petya to complete the task given by teacher but just for fun he decided to find the number of integers <image> with property that probability that f(x) = x is not less than 31.4159265352718281828459045%. In other words, Petya will pick up the number x if there exist at least 7 permutations of numbers p1, p2, p3, p4, for which f(x) = x.

Input

First line of the input will contain 6 integers, separated by spaces: p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b (1 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 31415). 

It is guaranteed that numbers p1, p2, p3, p4 will be pairwise distinct.

Output

Output the number of integers in the given range that have the given property.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
