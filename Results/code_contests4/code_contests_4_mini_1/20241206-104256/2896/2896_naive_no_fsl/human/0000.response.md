Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic required by the problem description. It only reads the input values but does not perform any calculations or checks to count the integers \( x \) in the range \([a; b]\) that satisfy the condition \( f(x) = x \) for at least 7 permutations of the numbers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \). 

For example, consider the input:

```
2 7 1 8 2 8
```

According to the problem, the program should evaluate the integers in the range from 2 to 8 and check how many of those integers satisfy the condition \( f(x) = x \) for at least 7 different permutations of the numbers 2, 7, 1, and 8. However, the program does not contain any logic to perform these evaluations, hence it cannot produce the correct output.

Since the program lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described, it will fail to produce correct results for this and other potential test cases.
