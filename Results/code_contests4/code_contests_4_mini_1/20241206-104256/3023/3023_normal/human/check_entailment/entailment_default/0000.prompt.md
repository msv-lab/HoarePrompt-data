You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N balls in a two-dimensional plane. The i-th ball is at coordinates (x_i, y_i).

We will collect all of these balls, by choosing two integers p and q such that p \neq 0 or q \neq 0 and then repeating the following operation:

* Choose a ball remaining in the plane and collect it. Let (a, b) be the coordinates of this ball. If we collected a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) in the previous operation, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, including when this is the first time to do this operation, the cost of this operation is 1.



Find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls when we optimally choose p and q.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9
* If i \neq j, x_i \neq x_j or y_i \neq y_j.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    N = read_int()
    balls = []
    for _ in range(N):
        balls.append(read_int_array())
    func_8(func_2(N, balls))
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a positive integer `N` (with 1 <= N <= 50) and then reads `N` arrays of integers which represent the coordinates of distinct balls. After populating the list `balls`, it calls another function `func_2` with `N` and `balls` as arguments, and subsequently calls `func_8` with the result of that call. The function does not specify what it returns or the behavior of `func_2` and `func_8`, leaving the overall output unclear.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, balls):
    bdict = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for (x, y) in balls:
        bdict[x].add(y)

    tried = set()
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            (p, q) = (balls[j][0] - balls[i][0], balls[j][1] - balls[i][1])
            if (p, q) not in tried:
                tried.add((p, q))
                tried.add((-p, -q))
                points = score(p, q)
                if points < ans:
                    ans = points
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `balls`, where each tuple contains unique coordinates of balls. It calculates the minimum score based on unique directional differences between pairs of balls using the function `score(p, q)`, and returns this minimum score. If no valid pairs are found or if `n` is less than 1, it will still return the initial value of `ans`, which is `n`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def score(p, q):
    out = n
    for (x, y) in balls:
        (nx, ny) = (x + p, y + q)
        if ny in bdict.get(nx, []):
            out -= 1
    return out
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts two integers `p` and `q` (with at least one being non-zero) and a positive integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 50). It calculates a score by starting with the value of `N` and decrementing it for each successful match found between the modified `ny` (calculated as `y + q`) and the values in `bdict` corresponding to the modified `nx` (calculated as `x + p`). The function returns this final score. Note that if there are no matches, the score will be `N`, and if all conditions are met for matches, the score could reach zero. The function does not handle the case where `bdict` may not contain any keys corresponding to `nx`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed in the surrounding code.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    if False and 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' in os.environ:
        func_4()
    else:
        func_1()
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and conditionally calls either `func_4` or `func_1` based on an always-false condition. As a result, it will always execute `func_1`, but the return value and effects of `func_1` are unknown from the provided information. The function does not return any value or output that can be determined from the given code.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    solution = solve
    test_inputs = None
    test_outputs = None
    judge = None
    slow_solution = None

        if slow_solution is not None:
            func_7(solution, test_inputs, slow_solution)
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and is designed to invoke other functions (`func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`) based on the conditional presence of certain variables (`solution`, `test_outputs`, `judge`, and `slow_solution`). However, it does not return any value or provide output related to the number of distinct balls based on their coordinates, as suggested by the annotations. Instead, it appears to set up for a testing or judging mechanism without producing a final result. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the stated purpose of returning the number of distinct balls.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(solution, inputs_answers):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for (args, test_ans) in inputs_answers:

            wrong += 1
        else:
            func_8('GOOD')
        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts a callable `solution` and a list of tuples `inputs_answers`, where each tuple contains arguments for `solution` and the expected result. It executes `solution` with the provided arguments, compares the output to the expected result, and counts how many tests failed. At the end of the evaluation, it logs a message indicating how many tests passed or failed. The function does not handle cases where `solution` raises exceptions or when the input arguments are not in the expected format.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(solution, inputs_gen, judge):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)

        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a solution function, an input generator function, and a judge function. It evaluates the solution against generated inputs and counts the number of incorrect answers based on the judge function. After all evaluations, it prints the total number of tests conducted and how many were incorrect, if any. The function does not handle any exceptions that may arise from the solution or judge functions and assumes they will execute without error.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(solution, inputs_gen, solution_slow):
    (total, wrong) = (0, 0)
    for args in inputs_gen:
        ans = solution(*deepcopy(args))

        total += 1
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a computational function `solution`, a generator `inputs_gen` that yields input data as tuples for testing, and a slower solution function `solution_slow` for comparison. It runs tests by executing `solution` and `solution_slow` on the same inputs, counts the number of incorrect results where `solution` does not match `solution_slow`, and logs the results. If all tests pass, it outputs a success message; otherwise, it reports the number of wrong answers out of the total tests conducted.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
