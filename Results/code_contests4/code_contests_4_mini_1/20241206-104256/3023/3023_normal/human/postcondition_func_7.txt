The function accepts a computational function `solution`, a generator `inputs_gen` that yields input data as tuples for testing, and a slower solution function `solution_slow` for comparison. It runs tests by executing `solution` and `solution_slow` on the same inputs, counts the number of incorrect results where `solution` does not match `solution_slow`, and logs the results. If all tests pass, it outputs a success message; otherwise, it reports the number of wrong answers out of the total tests conducted.
