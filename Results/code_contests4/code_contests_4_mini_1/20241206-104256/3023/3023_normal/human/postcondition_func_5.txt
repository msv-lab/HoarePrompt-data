The function accepts a callable `solution` and a list of tuples `inputs_answers`, where each tuple contains arguments for `solution` and the expected result. It executes `solution` with the provided arguments, compares the output to the expected result, and counts how many tests failed. At the end of the evaluation, it logs a message indicating how many tests passed or failed. The function does not handle cases where `solution` raises exceptions or when the input arguments are not in the expected format.
