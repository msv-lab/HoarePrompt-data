solution is a function that computes the minimum total cost required to collect all balls given the number of balls N and their coordinates (x_i, y_i) as a list of tuples, where 1 <= N <= 50 and |x_i|, |y_i| <= 10^9. inputs_gen is a generator function that yields input data in the specified format, and solution_slow is a reference to a slower alternative solution function for comparison.
