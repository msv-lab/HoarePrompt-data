According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
