The variable `x` is written to the file as a string. The previous state indicates that `x` is the second pair in `args`, but the specific value of `x` is not provided. The variable `sep` was also written to the file earlier if `at_start` is False, but is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` is being written as a string to the file, while the values of `sep` and `at_start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is written to the file as a string; `sep` is unchanged; `at_start` is False.**
