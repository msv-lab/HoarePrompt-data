To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet:

The variable `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. However, the values of `p` and `q` are not provided in the initial state or specified in the code. Since `p` and `q` are not defined, we cannot ascertain the exact value of `points`.

The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and a tuple `(-p, -q)` is added to the `tried` set, but these do not directly influence the output of the `score(p, q)` function.

Since `points` cannot be calculated without knowing `p` and `q`, we conclude the output state reflects the uncertainty regarding the `points` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; `points` cannot be determined without values for `p` and `q`.**
