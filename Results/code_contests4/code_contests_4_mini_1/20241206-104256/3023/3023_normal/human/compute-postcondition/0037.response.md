Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and their negations generated from the differences of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]` for all `j` in the range of `i`, `points` is the minimum score calculated from the function `score(p, q)` for valid `(p, q)` pairs, and `ans` is the minimum value of `points` across all iterations.**
