The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `points`, which is the result of the function `score(p, q)`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value for `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4; `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`; `ans` is assigned the value of `points`.**
