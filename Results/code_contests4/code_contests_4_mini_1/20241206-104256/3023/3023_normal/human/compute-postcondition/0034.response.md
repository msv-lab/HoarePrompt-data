The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, which was previously assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `tried` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current assignment of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `p` is updated to `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`, `q` is updated to `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, `ans` is assigned the value of `points`.**
