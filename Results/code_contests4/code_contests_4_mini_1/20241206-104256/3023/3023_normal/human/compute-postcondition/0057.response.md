According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `i` is also 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3. Since `j` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute again, and currently `j` is equal to `i`, the loop cannot execute a second time unless `i` is increased or another condition is met.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 3.**
