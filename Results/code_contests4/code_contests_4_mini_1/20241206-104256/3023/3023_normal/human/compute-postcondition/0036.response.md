Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `p` is updated to `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`, `q` is updated to `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`. If `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, then `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`.***
