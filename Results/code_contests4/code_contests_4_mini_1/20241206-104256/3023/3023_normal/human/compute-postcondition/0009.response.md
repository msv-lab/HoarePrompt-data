According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If `args` contains at least 2 pairs of integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `args` contains at least 1 pair of integers, and `x` is the first pair in `args`. For the loop to execute one more time, we must consider that `x` will take the next pair in `args`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `args` must contain at least 2 pairs of integers, and `x` must be updated to the next pair in the list.

State: **`args` contains at least 2 pairs of integers, `x` is the second pair in `args`, `sep` is written to the file, `at_start` is set to False**.
