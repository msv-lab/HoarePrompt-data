The `tried` set is updated by adding the tuple `(p, q)`. The previous values of `p` and `q` are `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]` and `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`, respectively. Since `tried` is a set, if `(p, q)` is already present in it, it will not change; otherwise, it will add this new tuple. The states of `n`, `i`, `p`, and `q` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `p` is updated to `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`, `q` is updated to `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`, and `(p, q)` is added to `tried`.**
