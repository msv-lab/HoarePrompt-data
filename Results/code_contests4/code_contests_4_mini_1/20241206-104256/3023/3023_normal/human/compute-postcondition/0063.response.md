Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; `p` and `q` are calculated from the values of `balls[j][0]`, `balls[i][0]`, `balls[j][1]`, and `balls[i][1]`; `tried` is updated to include the tuple `(-p, -q)`; `points` is assigned the value returned by `score(p, q)`; if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`.***
