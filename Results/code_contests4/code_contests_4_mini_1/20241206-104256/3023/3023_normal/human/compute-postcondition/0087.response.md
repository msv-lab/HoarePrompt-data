The code attempts to add a tuple `(p, q)` to a set called `tried`. The values of `p` and `q` are derived from the calculations involving the `balls` array, which are not defined in the initial state. However, we know that `p` and `q` are computed based on the values of `balls[4][0]`, `balls[3][0]`, `balls[4][1]`, and `balls[3][1]`.

Since the variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not directly affected by the code, and without specific values for the `balls` array, we cannot determine specific values for `p` and `q`. Thus, we state that `(p, q)` is added to the set `tried`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4; `(p, q)` is added to the set `tried`.**
