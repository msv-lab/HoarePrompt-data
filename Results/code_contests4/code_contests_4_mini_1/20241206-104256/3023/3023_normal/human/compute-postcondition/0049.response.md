According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Since `i` is 2, the loop can execute again because 2 is still equal to `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must still be 2**
