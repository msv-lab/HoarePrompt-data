According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `i` is also 3. Since the loop iterates while `j` is less than `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 4 and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `i` must be greater than 4**
