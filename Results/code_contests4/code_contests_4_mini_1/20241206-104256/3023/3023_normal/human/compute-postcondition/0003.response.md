According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` variable. If `args` contains at least one pair of integers, the loop will execute. Since `at_start` is set to True, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop but may influence behavior within the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `args` must contain at least one pair of integers (i.e., it should not be empty). When the loop begins, the first value of `x` will be the first pair of integers in `args`.

State: **`args` contains at least 1 pair of integers, `at_start` is True, `x` is the first pair in `args`**
