Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `p` is assigned the value of `balls[2][0] - balls[3][0]`, `q` is assigned the value of `balls[2][1] - balls[3][1]`. If the tuple `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, then `points` is assigned the value returned by `score(p, q)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`.***
