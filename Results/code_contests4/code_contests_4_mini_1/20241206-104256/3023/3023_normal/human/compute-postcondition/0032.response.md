The operation `tried.add((-p, -q))` adds the tuple `(-p, -q)` to the set `tried`. Given that `p` and `q` are already defined as `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]` and `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]` respectively, the values of `-p` and `-q` are simply the negatives of these computed differences. The `tried` set is updated to include these new values. The states of `n` and `i` are unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `p` is updated to `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`, `q` is updated to `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`, and `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`.**
