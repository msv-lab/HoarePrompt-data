Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `p` is `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`, `q` is `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`, and `tried` contains the tuple `(-p, -q)`. If the tuple `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, then `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, `ans` is updated to the value of `points`. If `(p, q)` is in `tried`, no changes are made to `ans`.***
