The `file.write` method writes the value obtained from `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. The `kwargs.pop` method will remove the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and return its value. If the key does not exist, it will return the default value `'\n'`. The state of `args`, `sep`, and `at_start` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` contains N pairs of integers, `sep` remains unchanged, `file` has written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to it, `at_start` is False.**
