According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

So, if `i` is currently 2, it will become 3 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `tried` contains tuples based on the values of `p` and `q`, `ans` is updated if any computed `points` were less than its initial value, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3.**
