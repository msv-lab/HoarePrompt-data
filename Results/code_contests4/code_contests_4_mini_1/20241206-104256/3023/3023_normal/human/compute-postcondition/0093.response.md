Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `i` (3), `tried` contains all unique tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` computed from `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]` and `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]` for `j` in the range from 2 to `i-1`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `points` computed from the function `score(p, q)` if any computed `points` were less than its initial value.**
