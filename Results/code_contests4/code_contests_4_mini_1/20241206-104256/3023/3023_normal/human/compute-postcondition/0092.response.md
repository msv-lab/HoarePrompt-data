Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4. If the pair `(-p, -q)` is not in the set `tried`, then `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, `ans` is updated to the value of `points`.***
