The function `score(p, q)` is called with the values of `p` and `q`, which are calculated based on the difference between the coordinates of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`. However, the specific values of `p` and `q` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `points` returned by the `score` function.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `tried` remain unchanged. The output state will indicate that `points` is assigned the result of `score(p, q)`, where `p` and `q` are based on the differences in coordinates.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2; `points` is assigned the value of `score(p, q)` where `p` and `q` are calculated based on the difference between the coordinates of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`.**
