The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `balls`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of balls, constrained to the range 1 <= n <= 50. The parameter `balls` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) that represent the coordinates of the i-th ball, with the condition that the absolute values of x_i and y_i are less than or equal to 10^9, and each ball's coordinates are unique. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum score 'ans' calculated from the function 'score(p, q)' for all valid unique tuples '(p, q)' and their negations across all iterations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of unique tuples balls representing coordinates. It returns the minimum score calculated from valid unique tuples and their negations.**
