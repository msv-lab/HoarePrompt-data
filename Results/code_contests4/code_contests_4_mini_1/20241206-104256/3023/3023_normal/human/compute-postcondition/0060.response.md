The state of the variables `p` and `q` is not explicitly defined here, so we will assume they are the results of calculations based on `balls[j][0]`, `balls[i][0]`, `balls[j][1]`, and `balls[i][1]` prior to this code execution. The code `tried.add((-p, -q))` adds a new tuple to the set `tried`, where both `p` and `q` are negated.

Since `tried` is modified by adding `(-p, -q)`, the output state reflects the inclusion of this new tuple while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; `p` and `q` are calculated based on the values of `balls[j][0]`, `balls[i][0]`, `balls[j][1]`, and `balls[i][1]`; `tried` is updated to include the tuple `(-p, -q)`.**
