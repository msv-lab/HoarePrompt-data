The code executes the method `add` on the set `tried`, inserting the tuple `(-p, -q)` into it. The values of `p` and `q` are not defined in the initial state, so we do not have specific values for their negations. The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, and `j`, along with the addition of `(-p, -q)` to the set `tried`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4; `(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried**.
