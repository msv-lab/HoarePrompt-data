According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the value of `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed with `j` starting at 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. However, since `j` must be less than `i` (which is 1), there will not be another valid iteration because `j` cannot reach 1 while still being less than `i`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the state must reflect that no changes are made to `points` or `ans`, and `j` cannot increment further.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `p` is `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`, `q` is `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`, `tried` contains the tuple `(-p, -q)`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be greater than 1.**
