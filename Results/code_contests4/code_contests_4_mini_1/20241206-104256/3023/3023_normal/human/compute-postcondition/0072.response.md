To determine the output state after the given code snippet executes, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code on the existing variables.

1. The variables `p` and `q` are already defined based on the expressions involving `balls`, which are not specified in this context, so we will treat `p` and `q` as expressions dependent on the values in the `balls` list.
2. The function `score(p, q)` is called with `p` and `q` as arguments. The result of this function call will be assigned to `points`, but since we do not have the implementation of `score`, we cannot determine the exact value of `points`.
3. The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the current code snippet.

Since the output state needs to reflect the current values of the variables, we note that `points` is assigned a value based on the `score` function but we do not specify what that value is since it depends on the function's implementation.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `p` is assigned the value of `balls[2][0] - balls[3][0]`, `q` is assigned the value of `balls[2][1] - balls[3][1]`, and `points` is assigned the value returned by `score(p, q)`**.
