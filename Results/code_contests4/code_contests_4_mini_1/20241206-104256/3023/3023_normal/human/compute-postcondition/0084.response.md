Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 3. If `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, and if `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `points`, which is the value returned from the function `score(p, q)`. Otherwise, if `(p, q)` is in `tried`, no changes are made to `ans`.***
