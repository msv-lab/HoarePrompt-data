The values of `p` and `q` are reassigned based on the current values of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`. The new values of `p` and `q` are calculated as follows:

- `p` is updated to `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`
- `q` is updated to `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`

The previous values of `p` and `q` are overwritten. The other variables, including `n`, `i`, and `tried`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new values of `p` and `q` based on their calculations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `p` is updated to `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]`, `q` is updated to `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`, `tried` contains the tuple `(-p, -q)`**.
