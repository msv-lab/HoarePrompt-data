According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which indicates how many times the loop will execute. The loop will execute a total of `i` times, starting with `j` initialized to 0 and increasing by 1 each iteration until it reaches `i - 1`. 

Given that `i` is currently 3, the loop will execute for `j` values of 0, 1, and 2. However, the task specifies that we need to ensure the loop executes a third time, which means `j` should be 2 at the start of the third iteration. 

Since the state indicates that `j` is currently 2 (which is the value it will have for the third execution), we only need to confirm that `i` is indeed 3 to allow for a valid iteration count.

For the loop to execute for the third time, `n` being a positive integer does not directly affect the execution of this loop since `n` is not referenced in the loop condition. However, it's noted that `n` must be greater than 3 for some context outside the loop, but it does not affect the current iteration status.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time `j` must be 2**.
