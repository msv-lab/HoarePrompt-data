Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `balls`, where each tuple contains unique coordinates of balls. It calculates the minimum score based on unique directional differences between pairs of balls using the function `score(p, q)`, and returns this minimum score. If no valid pairs are found or if `n` is less than 1, it will still return the initial value of `ans`, which is `n`. **
