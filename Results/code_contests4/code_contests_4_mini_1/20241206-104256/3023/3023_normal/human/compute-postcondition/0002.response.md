The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the other variables, `args`, `sep`, and `file`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, after execution, `at_start` is `True`, while `args`, `sep`, and `file` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` contains N pairs of integers (x_i, y_i); `sep` is either a specified separator or ' '; `file` is either a specified file or sys.stdout; `at_start` is True**.
