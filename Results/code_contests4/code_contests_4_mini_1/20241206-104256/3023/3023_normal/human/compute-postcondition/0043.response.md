The code adds the tuple `(-p, -q)` to the `tried` set. The variables `p` and `q` are calculated based on the values of `balls[j][0]`, `balls[j][1]`, `balls[i][0]`, and `balls[i][1]`, but their specific numeric values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the previous values of `p` and `q` cannot be determined explicitly. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the addition of the tuple to the set.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 1; tuple `(-p, -q)` is added to the `tried` set.**
