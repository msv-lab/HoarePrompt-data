According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has more items, the loop will execute again for the next item. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been written to the file as a string, `sep` remains unchanged, and `at_start` is False. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `x` should be set to the next item in `args`, and the iteration variable should be updated accordingly.

State: **`x` is the next item in `args`, `sep` is unchanged, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute again `args` must have more items than it had at the end of the last iteration**
