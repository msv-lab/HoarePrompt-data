The variable `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, where `p` and `q` are calculated based on the values of `balls[j][0]`, `balls[i][0]`, `balls[j][1]`, and `balls[i][1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `tried` remain unchanged during this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and includes the return of the `points` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 3; `p` and `q` are calculated based on the values of `balls[j][0]`, `balls[i][0]`, `balls[j][1]`, and `balls[i][1]`; `tried` is updated to include the tuple `(-p, -q)`, and `points` is assigned the value returned by `score(p, q)`.**
