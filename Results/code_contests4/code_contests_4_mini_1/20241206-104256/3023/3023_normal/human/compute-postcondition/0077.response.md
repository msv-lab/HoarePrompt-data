According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit set by `i`. The loop currently has `j` at 2, and `i` is 3. This means the loop has executed twice (with `j` taking values 0 and 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i`. Since `j` is currently 2, it can be incremented to 3 for the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 3, and `i` must remain as it is (3). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than 3**
