The function accepts no parameters and is designed to invoke other functions (`func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`) based on the conditional presence of certain variables (`solution`, `test_outputs`, `judge`, and `slow_solution`). However, it does not return any value or provide output related to the number of distinct balls based on their coordinates, as suggested by the annotations. Instead, it appears to set up for a testing or judging mechanism without producing a final result. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the stated purpose of returning the number of distinct balls.
