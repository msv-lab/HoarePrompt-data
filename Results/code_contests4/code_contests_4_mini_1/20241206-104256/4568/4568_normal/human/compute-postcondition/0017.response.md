Postcondition: ***`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings, the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is set to True; `canwin` remains True; `node` is a non-empty list assigned the value of `ttree.root.childs`; `child` is the element at index `it` of the `node` list; `odd_w` is True; and `even_w` remains True if it was initially True, indicating that the condition for `odd_w` being True has been satisfied.***
