Postcondition: ***`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings, the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is set to True; `canwin` remains True; `node` is a non-empty list assigned the value of `ttree.root.childs`; `it` is the next element in the `node` list; `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; if `odd_w` is True, then `even_w` remains the result of `func_1(child, 0)`.***
