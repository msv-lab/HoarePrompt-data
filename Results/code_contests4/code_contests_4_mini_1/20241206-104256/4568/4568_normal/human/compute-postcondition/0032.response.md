The variable `odd_w` is assigned the value of `True`. This directly impacts the state of `odd_w`, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `odd_w`.

Output State: **`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings, the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is set to True; `canwin` remains True; `node` is a non-empty list assigned the value of `ttree.root.childs`; `it` is the next element in the `node` list; `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`; `odd_w` is True; `even_w` remains the result of `func_1(child, 0)`**.
