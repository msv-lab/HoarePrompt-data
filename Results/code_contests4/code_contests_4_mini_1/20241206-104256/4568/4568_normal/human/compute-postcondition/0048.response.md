The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ttree`, which is a tuple. The first element of `ttree` is a list containing `n` non-empty strings (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`), and the second element is an integer `k` (where `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`). Each string in the list consists solely of lowercase English letters, and the total length of all strings does not exceed `10^5`. 

After executing the function body, there are three possible outcomes based on certain conditions:

- Case_1: The function returns the integer 3.
- Case_2: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_3: The function returns the integer 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a tuple `ttree` consisting of a list of non-empty strings and an integer, and return one of three integers (3, 1, or 2) based on specific conditions evaluated within the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `ttree` containing a list of non-empty strings and an integer, returning either 3, 1, or 2 based on specific conditions.**
