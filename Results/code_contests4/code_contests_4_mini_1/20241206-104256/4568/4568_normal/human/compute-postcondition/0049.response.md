Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `ttree`, which contains a list of non-empty strings and an integer. It iterates through the children of `ttree.root` and checks conditions based on the results from `func_1`. The function returns 3 if both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, 1 if only `canloss` is True, and 2 if neither condition is met. The function does not handle the case where `ttree` has no children, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
