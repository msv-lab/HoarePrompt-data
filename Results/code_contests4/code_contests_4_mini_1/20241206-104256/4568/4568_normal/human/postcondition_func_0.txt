The function accepts a `node` object and an integer `level`, returning a tuple `(odd_ret, even_ret)`. `odd_ret` indicates whether any child node at an odd level has `isWord` set to True, while `even_ret` indicates whether any child node at an even level has `isWord` set to True. If the node is None or not a word, the function processes its children recursively to determine these values. The function can return (True, False) or (False, True) based on the conditions of the nodes processed.
