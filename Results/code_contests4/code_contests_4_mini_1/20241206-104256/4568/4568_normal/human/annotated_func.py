    #The program returns a tuple (odd_ret, even_ret), indicating whether any 'odd_w' was True (odd_ret) and whether any 'even_w' was True (even_ret)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a `node` object and an integer `level`, returning a tuple `(odd_ret, even_ret)`. `odd_ret` indicates whether any child node at an odd level has `isWord` set to True, while `even_ret` indicates whether any child node at an even level has `isWord` set to True. If the node is None or not a word, the function processes its children recursively to determine these values. The function can return (True, False) or (False, True) based on the conditions of the nodes processed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `ttree`, which contains a list of non-empty strings and an integer. It iterates through the children of `ttree.root` and checks conditions based on the results from `func_1`. The function returns 3 if both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, 1 if only `canloss` is True, and 2 if neither condition is met. The function does not handle the case where `ttree` has no children, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
