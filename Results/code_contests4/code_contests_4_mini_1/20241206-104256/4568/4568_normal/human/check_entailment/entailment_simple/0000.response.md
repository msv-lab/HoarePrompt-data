To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and how the program aims to fulfill them.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Rules**: Two players build a word from a list of strings, and a player loses if they cannot make a move that results in a prefix of any string in the group.
2. **Winning Conditions**: We need to determine if the first player (who starts the game) can force a win given the optimal play of both players over `k` games. The player who loses the i-th game makes the first move in the (i+1)-th game.

### Program Breakdown:
The program consists of two functions:
- **func_1**: This function recursively checks if a player can win based on the current state of the game represented by a node in a trie-like structure. It evaluates whether the current level (depth) of the game is odd or even to determine potential winning and losing scenarios.
- **func_2**: This function evaluates the overall game situation based on the results from `func_1`. It checks whether the first player can guarantee a win or if they are in a position where they will lose if both play optimally.

### Key Points of Evaluation:
- **Return Values**: The return values of `func_1` (a tuple of boolean values) are correctly used to determine if there's a path to winning or losing based on the children nodes.
- **Game Logic**: The logic in `func_2` appropriately checks for conditions where the first player can win or lose based on the results from `func_1`.
- **Prefix Condition**: The program reflects the game's prefix condition through the structure of `node` and `childs`, and it evaluates possible moves through recursive exploration of the trie-like structure.
  
### Evaluation of Correctness:
1. **Optimal Play**: The program is designed to handle optimal plays by both players through the recursive checking of game states.
2. **Handling Multiple Games**: The logic accounts for the `k` games by determining the outcome based on the game state at the end of the last game.
3. **Return Statements**: The return values of 1, 2, and 3 in `func_2` effectively categorize game outcomes into winning and losing scenarios for the first player.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game rules and evaluates the winning conditions as described in the problem statement. It utilizes a recursive approach to determine the outcome based on the prefixes and the turn structure of the game.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
