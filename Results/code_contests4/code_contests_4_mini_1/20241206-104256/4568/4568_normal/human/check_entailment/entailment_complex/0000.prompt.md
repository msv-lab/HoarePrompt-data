You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.

Given a group of n non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.

Andrew and Alex decided to play this game k times. The player who is the loser of the i-th game makes the first move in the (i + 1)-th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last (k-th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.

Input

The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Each of the next n lines contains a single non-empty string from the given group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed 105. Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.

Output

If the player who moves first wins, print "First", otherwise print "Second" (without the quotes).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and each of the following n lines contains a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters, with the total length of all strings not exceeding 10^5.
def func_1(node, level):
    if (node is not None and node.isWord) :
        if (level % 2 == 1) :
            return True, False
            #The program returns a tuple containing True and False
        else :
            return False, True
            #The program returns False and True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), and each of the following `n` lines contains a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters, with the total length of all strings not exceeding 10^5. The variable `node` is None or `node` is not a word (node.isWord is False).
    nodes = node.childs
    odd_ret = False
    even_ret = False
    for it in nodes:
        child = nodes.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, level + 1)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_ret = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_ret = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `node` is not None, `nodes` is a non-empty collection from `node.childs`, `odd_ret` is True if any `odd_w` was True, `even_ret` is True if any `even_w` was True.
    return odd_ret, even_ret
    #The program returns a tuple (odd_ret, even_ret), indicating whether any 'odd_w' was True (odd_ret) and whether any 'even_w' was True (even_ret)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a `node` object and an integer `level`, returning a tuple `(odd_ret, even_ret)`. `odd_ret` indicates whether any child node at an odd level has `isWord` set to True, while `even_ret` indicates whether any child node at an even level has `isWord` set to True. If the node is None or not a word, the function processes its children recursively to determine these values. The function can return (True, False) or (False, True) based on the conditions of the nodes processed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ttree is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings, and the second element is an integer k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Each string in the list consists only of lowercase English letters, and the total length of all strings does not exceed 10^5.
def func_2(ttree):
    canloss = False
    canwin = False
    node = ttree.root.childs
    for it in node:
        child = node.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, 0)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_w = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_w = True
        
        if even_w:
            canwin = True
        
        if odd_w:
            canloss = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings, the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is True if any `odd_w` was True during the iterations; `canwin` is True if any `even_w` was True during the iterations; `node` is a non-empty list assigned the value of `ttree.root.childs`.
    if (canloss and canwin) :
        return 3
        #The program returns the integer 3
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings, the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is True or False; `canwin` is True or False; `canloss` and `canwin` are not both True; `node` is a non-empty list assigned the value of `ttree.root.childs`.
    if canloss :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`ttree` is a tuple where the first element is a list of n non-empty strings, the second element is an integer k; `canloss` is False; `canwin` is True or False; `canloss` and `canwin` are not both True; `node` is a non-empty list assigned the value of `ttree.root.childs`.
    return 2
    #The program returns the integer 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `ttree`, which contains a list of non-empty strings and an integer. It iterates through the children of `ttree.root` and checks conditions based on the results from `func_1`. The function returns 3 if both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, 1 if only `canloss` is True, and 2 if neither condition is met. The function does not handle the case where `ttree` has no children, which could lead to unexpected behavior.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
