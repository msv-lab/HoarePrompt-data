You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Recently Luba learned about a special kind of numbers that she calls beautiful numbers. The number is called beautiful iff its binary representation consists of k + 1 consecutive ones, and then k consecutive zeroes.

Some examples of beautiful numbers: 

  * 12 (110); 
  * 1102 (610); 
  * 11110002 (12010); 
  * 1111100002 (49610). 



More formally, the number is beautiful iff there exists some positive integer k such that the number is equal to (2k - 1) * (2k - 1).

Luba has got an integer number n, and she wants to find its greatest beautiful divisor. Help her to find it!

Input

The only line of input contains one number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number Luba has got.

Output

Output one number — the greatest beautiful divisor of Luba's number. It is obvious that the answer always exists.
