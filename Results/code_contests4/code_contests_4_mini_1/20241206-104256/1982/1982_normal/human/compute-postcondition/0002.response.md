The value of `p` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `i` is a string ('110'), it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer that has been updated to the input value; `i` is '110'; `p` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that has been updated to the input value; `i` is '110'; `p` is 1**
