According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `int(i, 2)` (which converts the binary string `i` to an integer) is less than or equal to `n`. 

Right before the loop, `i` is '110', which converts to the integer 6 (in decimal). Since `n` is an integer that has been updated to the input value, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 6 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 6.

State: **`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6, `i` is '110', `p` is 1**
