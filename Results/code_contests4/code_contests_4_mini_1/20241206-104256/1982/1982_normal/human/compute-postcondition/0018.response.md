The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on a predefined value of `n`, which is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000. The function's behavior and output based on the value of `n` are not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently unspecified. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its behavior based on the internal value of n is not defined.**
