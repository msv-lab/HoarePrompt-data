The value of `i` is being updated to a new string value formed by concatenating `'1'`, the previous value of `i`, and `'0'`. Since `i` was initially a string, it remains a string after this operation. The value of `n` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6; `i` is updated to `'1' + previous i + '0'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6; `i` is updated to '1' + previous i + '0'**
