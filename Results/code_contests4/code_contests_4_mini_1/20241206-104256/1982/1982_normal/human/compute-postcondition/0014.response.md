Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6. If `n` is divisible by the integer value of the binary string `i`, then it satisfies the condition `n % int(i, 2) == 0`. If `n` is not divisible by `int(i, 2)`, the state of `n` remains unchanged and the loop may execute again if `n` is greater than the new value of `int(i, 2)`.***
