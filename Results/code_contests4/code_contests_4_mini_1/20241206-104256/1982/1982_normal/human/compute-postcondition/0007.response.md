The value of `i` is being modified by concatenating the string '1', the current value of `i`, and the string '0'. The previous value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it can be any string value. The variable `n` does not affect the outcome of `i` in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6; `i` is modified to '1' + current value of `i` + '0'.**
