Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6. If `n` is divisible by the integer value of `i` interpreted as a binary number (denoted as `p`), then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code, and the program continues without any changes to the state.***
