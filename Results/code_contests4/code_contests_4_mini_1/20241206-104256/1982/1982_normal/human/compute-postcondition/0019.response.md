Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from user input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`. It calculates the largest power of 2 (in decimal) that divides `n` by generating binary representations of powers of 2 in the form of a binary string. The largest divisor found is printed as output. If `n` is less than 6, the loop may not execute sufficiently, and the printed result could be incorrect or default to 1.**
