The value of `p` is assigned the result of `int(i, 2)`, which converts the binary string `'110'` into its integer equivalent. The integer value of `'110'` in binary is `6`. Therefore, after execution, `p` becomes `6`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6, `i` is '110', `p` is 6, and `n` is divisible by 6.**
