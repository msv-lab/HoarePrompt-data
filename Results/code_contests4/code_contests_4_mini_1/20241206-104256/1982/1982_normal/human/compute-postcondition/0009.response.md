The code assigns the value of `p` to be the integer representation of `i` in base 2. The current state specifies that `n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6, and the loop condition indicates that `int(i, 2)` must be less than or equal to `n`. However, without the specific value of `i`, we can only conclude that `p` will have a value derived from `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6, and `p` is the integer value of `i` interpreted as a binary number.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6, `p` is the integer value of `i` interpreted as a binary number**
