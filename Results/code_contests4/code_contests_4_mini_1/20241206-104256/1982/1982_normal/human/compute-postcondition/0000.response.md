The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input within the specified range. Since `n` is already defined as an integer satisfying the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, its previous value is replaced by the input value. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer that has been updated to the input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that has been updated to the input value**
