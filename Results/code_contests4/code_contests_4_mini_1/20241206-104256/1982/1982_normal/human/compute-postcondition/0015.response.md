The value of `i` is being modified by concatenating '1' at the beginning and '0' at the end of the current value of `i`. The previous state of `i` is unknown, but it is a binary string. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code snippet only affects `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6; `i` has been modified by adding '1' at the start and '0' at the end.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is equal to or greater than 6; `i` has been modified by adding '1' at the start and '0' at the end.**
