The function accepts a string `sequence` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', along with two characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`. It counts how many characters are misplaced at both odd and even indices compared to `oddchar` and `evenchar`, respectively. It returns the sum of the minimum number of swaps needed to correct the misplaced characters and the absolute difference between the counts of even and odd misplaced characters. The function can handle sequences of length up to 100,000.
