Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than 0, `oddmisplaced` is 0, `evenmisplaced` is 1, `i` is 0, and `i` is an even integer. If `i` is an odd integer, then `evenmisplaced` is incremented by 1, and the character at position `i` in `sequence` is not equal to `oddchar`.***
