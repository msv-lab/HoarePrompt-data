Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is even and `sequence[i]` is not equal to `evenchar`, then `evenmisplaced` is increased by 1. If `i` is not even or `sequence[i]` is equal to `evenchar`, `evenmisplaced` remains unchanged.***
