Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is odd and `sequence[i]` is not equal to `oddchar`, `oddmisplaced` is increased by 1 while `evenmisplaced` remains unchanged. If `i` is even or `sequence[i]` is equal to `oddchar`, `oddmisplaced` remains unchanged.***
