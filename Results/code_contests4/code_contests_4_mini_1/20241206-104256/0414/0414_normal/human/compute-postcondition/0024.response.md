The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `sequence`, `oddchar`, and `evenchar`. The parameter `sequence` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) consisting of characters 'b' and 'r'. The parameters `oddchar` and `evenchar` are characters representing the colors of cockroaches, specifically 'b' for black and 'r' for red. 

After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the minimum number of swaps needed (swaps) and the absolute difference between even and odd misplaced characters (color). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `sequence` of 'b' and 'r' characters along with two characters `oddchar` and `evenchar`, and return the sum of the minimum number of swaps required and the absolute difference between the counts of misplaced odd and even characters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string sequence of 'b' and 'r' characters, and two characters oddchar and evenchar representing colors, and returns the sum of the minimum number of swaps needed and the absolute difference between even and odd misplaced characters.**
