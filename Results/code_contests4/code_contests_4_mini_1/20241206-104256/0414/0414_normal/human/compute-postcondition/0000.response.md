The code calculates the length of the string `sequence` and assigns it to the variable `length`. The value of `length` will be the number of characters in the string `sequence`, which can range from 1 to 100,000. The variables `oddchar` and `evenchar` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `length` is `n`.

Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000); `length` is `n`**
