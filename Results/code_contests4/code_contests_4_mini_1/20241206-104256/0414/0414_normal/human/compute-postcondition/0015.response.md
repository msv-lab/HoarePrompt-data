According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `length` and the index `i`. If `i` is less than `length`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means the current value of `i` is now `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `i + 1`, and the value of `i` after this increment will be `i + 2`. 

Since `length` is greater than 0, `length` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
