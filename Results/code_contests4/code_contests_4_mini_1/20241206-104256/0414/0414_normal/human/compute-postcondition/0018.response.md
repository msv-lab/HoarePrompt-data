The code increments the variable `oddmisplaced` by 1. The previous values of `oddmisplaced` and the other variables are not mentioned, but we know `length` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i` has been updated to `i + 1`. The state of `evenmisplaced` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `evenmisplaced` remains unchanged, and `oddmisplaced` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `evenmisplaced` remains unchanged, and `oddmisplaced` is increased by 1.**
