Postcondition: ***`sequence` is a string of length `n`, `length` is greater than 0. If `i` is an odd integer and the character at position `i` in `sequence` is not equal to `oddchar`, then `oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1 and `evenmisplaced` remains 1. If `i` is even, the state of `oddmisplaced` and `evenmisplaced` remains unchanged as no else part exists.***
