To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze how the program is intended to function and whether it meets the requirements.

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make the colors of cockroaches alternate. The two possible moves are swapping any two cockroaches or changing the color of a cockroach.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates how many cockroaches are misplaced in odd and even positions compared to the expected colors (either starting with 'r' or 'b'). It counts the number of misplaced cockroaches in even and odd indices, then calculates the number of swaps needed and the number of color changes needed.

### Potential Issue:
1. The program assumes that a swap can fix two misplaced cockroaches, which is correct. However, it does not consider that if both odd and even positions are incorrectly filled with the same color (for example, if there are more 'b's than 'r's in both positions), then simply counting the differences would not be sufficient to cover cases where multiple changes are needed.
2. Specifically, it does not handle scenarios where there are an unequal number of odd and even placements correctly. For example, in a case where the sequence has an excess of one color in the positions that should ideally be alternating, the current implementation might not yield the correct minimum moves.

### Example Case to Test:
Consider the input:
```
4
rrbb
```
Following the logic:
- For the configuration starting with 'r' ('rbrb'), we have:
  - Even indices: 2 misplaced ('r' should be at index 0 and 2)
  - Odd indices: 0 misplaced
  - Swaps = 0, Color changes = 2 (to change 'r' at index 1 and 'r' at index 3 to 'b').
  
- For the configuration starting with 'b' ('brbr'), we have:
  - Even indices: 0 misplaced
  - Odd indices: 2 misplaced ('b' should be at index 1 and 3).
  - Swaps = 0, Color changes = 2.

The total moves calculated would be 2, which is correct. However, if there is an excess of one color in a way that requires more than simple color changes, the program may fail to capture that.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program's logic and running through a few example cases, it appears that there are scenarios where it wouldn't yield the correct answer due to the potential miscalculation of required moves when one color is significantly overrepresented in both even and odd positions.

Correctness: **False**.
