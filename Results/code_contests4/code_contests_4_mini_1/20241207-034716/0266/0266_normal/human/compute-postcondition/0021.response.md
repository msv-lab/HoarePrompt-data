The value of `first` is assigned the result of the expression `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, which calculates the Unicode difference between the first character of the input string `s` and the character 'a'. The value of `first` will depend on the first character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a'; `dyn[first][last]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `len(s)`.
