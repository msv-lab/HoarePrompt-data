According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it can support one more iteration. 

State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a'; `dyn[first][last]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `len(s)` for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
