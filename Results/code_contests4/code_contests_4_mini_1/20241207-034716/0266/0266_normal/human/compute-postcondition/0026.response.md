Postcondition: ***`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is updated to the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a', `j` is 0. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` is now equal to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`.***
