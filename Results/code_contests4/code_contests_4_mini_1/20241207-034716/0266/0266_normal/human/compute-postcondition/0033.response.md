Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a', `j` is 25. If `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 for any `j` from 0 to 25, then `dyn[j][last]` will be assigned the value of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for those specific `j` values. Otherwise, `dyn[j][last]` remains unchanged for `j` where `dyn[j][first]` is not greater than 0.**
