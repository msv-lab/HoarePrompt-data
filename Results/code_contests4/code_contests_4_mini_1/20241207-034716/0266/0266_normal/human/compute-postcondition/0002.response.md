The code initializes a two-dimensional list `dyn` with dimensions 26x26, where each element is set to 0. The variable `__author__` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer. There are no changes to the existing variables, just the creation of the new list. Therefore, the Output State is: `__author__` is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer, `dyn` is a 26x26 list filled with zeros.

Output State: **`__author__` is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is an input integer, `dyn` is a 26x26 list filled with zeros**
