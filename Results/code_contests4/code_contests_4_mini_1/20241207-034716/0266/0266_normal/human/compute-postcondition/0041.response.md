The variable `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. The previous value of `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, and `len(s)` is the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, `dyn[j][last]` will be updated based on the sum of these two values.

The output state will reflect that `dyn[j][last]` is now the sum of `dyn[j][first]` (which is greater than 0) and the length of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a', `j` is 0, `s` is the input string, `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`**.
