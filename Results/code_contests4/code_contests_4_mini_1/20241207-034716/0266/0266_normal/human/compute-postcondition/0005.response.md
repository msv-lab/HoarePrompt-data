The code assigns the value of `first` as the difference between the Unicode code point of the first character of string `s` and the Unicode code point of the character 'a'. The value of `s` is an input string, but since its specific value is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `first`. However, we know that `first` will be an integer representing the position of the first character of `s` in the alphabet, subtracted by the position of 'a'. The values of `__author__`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a'.**
