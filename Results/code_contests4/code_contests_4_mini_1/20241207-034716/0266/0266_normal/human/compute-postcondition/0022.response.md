The variable `last` is assigned the value of the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a'. The previous value of `last` is unknown, but it will be updated based on the last character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', and `last` is updated to the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a'.

Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is updated to the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a'**.
