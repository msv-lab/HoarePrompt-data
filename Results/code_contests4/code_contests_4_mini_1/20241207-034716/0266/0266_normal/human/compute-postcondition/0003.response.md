According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. Thus, before the loop begins, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first execution.

State: **`__author__` is set to 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0**
