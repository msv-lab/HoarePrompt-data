The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which is constrained to be between 1 and 500,000 (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5). Following this integer, it accepts `n` non-empty strings, where each string is composed of lowercase Latin letters and has a maximum length of 10 characters. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters based on the constraints given.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5) followed by n non-empty strings of lowercase Latin letters, each with a length not exceeding 10 characters. The specific return value is not provided.**
