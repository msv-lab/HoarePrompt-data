Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a', `j` is 25, `s` is the input string. For each `j` from 0 to 25, if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then `dyn[j][last]` will be updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`.**
