The statement `dyn[j][last] = dyn[j][first] + len(s)` assigns a new value to `dyn[j][last]`. The right-hand side of the assignment consists of two components: `dyn[j][first]` and `len(s)`. 

1. The value of `dyn[j][first]` is known to be greater than 0 (as per the initial conditions).
2. `len(s)` provides the length of the string `s`, which is a positive integer.
3. Since `dyn[j][last]` is being assigned a value that is the sum of two positive integers (assuming `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0 and `len(s)` is positive), the value of `dyn[j][last]` will also be a positive integer.

The states of the other variables (`__author__`, `n`, `i`, `first`, and `j`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a', and `dyn[j][last]` is assigned a value greater than `dyn[j][first]` since it is the sum of `dyn[j][first]` (greater than 0) and `len(s)` (positive).

Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `first` is the Unicode difference between the first character of `s` and 'a', `last` is the Unicode difference between the last character of `s` and 'a', `dyn[j][last]` is greater than `dyn[j][first]`.**
