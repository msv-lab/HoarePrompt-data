The function accepts an integer `n` followed by `n` non-empty strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It calculates a 26x26 matrix (`dyn`) that tracks the maximum length of strings that start with a specific character and end with another. Finally, it outputs the maximum length of strings that start and end with the same character. If no such strings exist, the output will be 0. The function does not explicitly return any value; instead, it directly prints the result.
