Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 5 <= n <= 100) and an unused parameter `a`. It calculates the factorial of `n` divided by the sum of the first `a` integers, resulting in the quotient of these two values. If `a` is 0, the sum of the first `a` integers is 0, which might lead to a division by zero error; however, the code does not handle this case, potentially resulting in an exception. **
