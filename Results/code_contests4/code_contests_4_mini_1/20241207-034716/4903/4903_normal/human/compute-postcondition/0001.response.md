`s` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `s` was not defined, but it is now set to 1. The other variables `n` and `r` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1**
