`p` is decremented by 1. Since `p` is equal to `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, the new value of `p` will be `n - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is `n - 1`; `g` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is `n - 1`; `g` is 1**
