The variable `s` is assigned the value of `s * g`. The previous value of `s` is 2 and the value of `g` is 3. Therefore, `s` becomes 2 * 3 = 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to (n * (n - 1)) * (n - 2); `s` is 6; `p` is `n - 3`; `g` is 3; `i` is 3**
