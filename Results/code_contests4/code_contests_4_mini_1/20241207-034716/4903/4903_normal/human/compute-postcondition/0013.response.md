The value of `g` is incremented by 1. Since `g` was initially 2, after execution, `g` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `p` is `n - 2`; `g` is 3; for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `p` is `n - 2`; `g` is 3; for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2.**
