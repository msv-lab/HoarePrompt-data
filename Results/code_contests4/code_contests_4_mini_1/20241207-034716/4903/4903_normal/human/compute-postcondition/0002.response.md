`p` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an integer within the range of 5 to 100. The values of `r` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `p` is n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `p` is n**
