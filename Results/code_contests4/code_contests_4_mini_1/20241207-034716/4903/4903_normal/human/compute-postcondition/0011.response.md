The value of `p` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `p` is `n - 1`, which is at least 4 since `n` is at least 5. After this operation, `p` becomes `n - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `p` is `n - 2`; `g` is 2; `a` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `p` is `n - 2`; `g` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2**
