The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint of being between 5 and 100 (inclusive). The parameter `a` is unused in the computation. The function returns the quotient of the product of integers from `n` down to 1 divided by the sum of the first `a` integers, which is calculated as `a * (a + 1) / 2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and an unused parameter `a`, and return the quotient of the factorial of `n` divided by the sum of the first `a` integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (an integer between 5 and 100) and an unused parameter a, returning the quotient of the factorial of n divided by the sum of the first a integers.**
