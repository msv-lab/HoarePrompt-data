The variable `s` is updated by multiplying its current value by `g`. The previous value of `s` is 1, and the value of `g` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1 * 2 = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `p` is `n - 2`; `g` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 2; `p` is `n - 2`; `g` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2.**
