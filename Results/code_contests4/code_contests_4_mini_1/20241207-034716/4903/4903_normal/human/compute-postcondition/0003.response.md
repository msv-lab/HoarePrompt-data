The variable `g` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables `n`, `r`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `p` is n; `g` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1; `p` is n; `g` is 1**
