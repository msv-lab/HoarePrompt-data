The variable `r` is assigned the value of `r * p`. Given that `r` is currently equal to `n` and `p` is `n - 1`, we can express this as `r = n * (n - 1)`. Other variables (`s`, `g`, `a`, `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, we need to specify the new value of `r` in relation to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n * (n - 1)`; `s` is 1; `p` is `n - 1`; `g` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `a` must be greater than 2; and `i` is 2**
