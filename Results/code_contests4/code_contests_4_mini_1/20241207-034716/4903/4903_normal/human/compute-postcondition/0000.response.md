`r` is assigned the value `1`, and since there are no other affected variables or calculations, the output state reflects this assignment. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1**
