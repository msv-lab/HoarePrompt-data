The value of `g` is incremented by 1, and since `g` is initially 3, it becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to (n * (n - 1)) * (n - 2); `s` is 6; `p` is `n - 3`; `g` is 4; `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is now equal to (n * (n - 1)) * (n - 2); `s` is 6; `p` is `n - 3`; `g` is 4; `i` is 3**
