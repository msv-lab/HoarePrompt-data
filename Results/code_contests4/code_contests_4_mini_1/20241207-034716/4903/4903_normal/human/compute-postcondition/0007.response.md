The value of `s` is updated to be `s * g`. The previous value of `s` is 1, and `g` is also 1. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1 * 1, which is still 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is `n - 1`; `g` is 1**
