The value of `r` is updated by multiplying it with `p`. Since `p` is equal to `n` and `n` is an integer within the range of 5 to 100, `r` will now be equal to `n` (because `r` was initially 1). The other variables (`s`, `g`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is n; `g` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is now equal to `n`; `s` is 1; `p` is n; `g` is 1**.
