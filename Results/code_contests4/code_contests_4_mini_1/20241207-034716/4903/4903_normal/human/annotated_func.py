#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, and a is an unused parameter.
def func_1(n, a):
    r = 1
    s = 1
    p = n
    g = 1
    for i in range(a):
        r = r * p

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= `n` <= 100; `r` is equal to the product of the integers from `n` to 1; `s` is equal to `a * (a + 1) / 2`; `p` is `n - a`; `g` is `a + 1`.
    return r / s
    #The program returns the quotient of the product of integers from `n` to 1 divided by the sum of the first `a` integers calculated as `a * (a + 1) / 2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 5 <= n <= 100) and an unused parameter `a`. It calculates the factorial of `n` divided by the sum of the first `a` integers, resulting in the quotient of these two values. If `a` is 0, the sum of the first `a` integers is 0, which might lead to a division by zero error; however, the code does not handle this case, potentially resulting in an exception.
