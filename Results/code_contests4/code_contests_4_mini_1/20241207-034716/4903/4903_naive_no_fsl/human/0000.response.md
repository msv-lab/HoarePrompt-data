To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem description and the code.

The problem description states that there are `n` east to west paths and `n` north to south paths, which creates `n^2` intersections. We need to determine the number of ways to place 5 benches on these intersections such that no two benches are on the same path.

The formula for placing `k` indistinguishable items (benches) into `n` distinguishable boxes (paths) such that each box can hold only one item is given by the combinatorial formula: 

\[ C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!} \]

For this problem, since we want to place 5 benches, the specific formula becomes:

\[ C(n, 5) = \frac{n!}{5! \cdot (n-5)!} \]

This counts the number of ways to choose 5 paths from `n` available paths.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    r = 1
    s = 1
    p = n
    g = 1
    for i in range(a):
        r = r * p
        p -= 1
        s = s * g
        g += 1
    return r / s

n = int(raw_input())
x = n * (n - 4) * (n - 3) * (n - 2) * (n - 1) * func_1(n, 5)
print(x)
```

1. The function `func_1(n, 5)` computes the product of `n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * (n-4)` which is equivalent to `nP5` (the number of permutations of `n` taken `5` at a time). 

2. The line `x = n * (n - 4) * (n - 3) * (n - 2) * (n - 1) * func_1(n, 5)` seems incorrect because it attempts to multiply `n * (n - 4) * (n - 3) * (n - 2) * (n - 1)` with the result of `func_1(n, 5)`, which does not yield the correct number of combinations to place the benches.

3. The correct approach should only focus on how to choose 5 paths from `n` paths without regard to the order of benches, which means the final output should be the combinations `C(n, 5)` and not a product of additional factors.

### Example Case
Let's consider `n = 5`. 

The expected number of ways to place the benches is \( C(5, 5) = 1 \).

However, the program outputs:

\[ x = 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 \]

This is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to compute the right number of combinations and instead uses incorrect multiplicative logic. 

Correctness: **False**
