You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered n participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant i is a_i. These rating changes are perfectly balanced — their sum is equal to 0.

Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared semi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.

There are two conditions though: 

  * For each participant i, their modified rating change b_i must be integer, and as close to (a_i)/(2) as possible. It means that either b_i = ⌊ (a_i)/(2) ⌋ or b_i = ⌈ (a_i)/(2) ⌉. In particular, if a_i is even, b_i = (a_i)/(2). Here ⌊ x ⌋ denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than x, and ⌈ x ⌉ denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than x. 
  * The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced — their sum must be equal to 0. 



Can you help with that?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 13 845), denoting the number of participants.

Each of the next n lines contains a single integer a_i (-336 ≤ a_i ≤ 1164), denoting the rating change of the i-th participant.

The sum of all a_i is equal to 0.

Output

Output n integers b_i, each denoting the modified rating change of the i-th participant in order of input.

For any i, it must be true that either b_i = ⌊ (a_i)/(2) ⌋ or b_i = ⌈ (a_i)/(2) ⌉. The sum of all b_i must be equal to 0.

If there are multiple solutions, print any. We can show that a solution exists for any valid input.

Note

In the first example, b_1 = 5, b_2 = -3 and b_3 = -2 is another correct solution.

In the second example there are 6 possible solutions, one of them is shown in the example output.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 13,845, and a_i are integers for i from 1 to n, where -336 ≤ a_i ≤ 1164, and the sum of all a_i is equal to 0.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        a.append(x)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` contains `n` integers input by the user.
    b = []
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] % 2 == 0:
            b.append(a[i] / 2)
        
        if a[i] % 2 != 0:
            count = count + 1
            if count % 2 == 1:
                a[i] = a[i] / 2
                b.append(a[i])
            if count % 2 == 0:
                a[i] = a[i] / 2 + 1
                b.append(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `count` is the number of odd integers in `a`; `b` contains half of each even integer in `a` and modified values of odd integers in `a` based on their positions; `a` is modified with updated values for odd integers.
    print(b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 13,845) and subsequently reads `n` integer values, `a_i` (where -336 ≤ a_i ≤ 1164) that sum to 0. It processes these integers by dividing even integers by 2 and modifying odd integers based on their position: for odd integers at odd positions, it divides by 2, while for odd integers at even positions, it divides by 2 and adds 1. The processed integers are then stored in a list `b`, which is printed at the end. The function does not return any values but outputs the list `b` to the console.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
