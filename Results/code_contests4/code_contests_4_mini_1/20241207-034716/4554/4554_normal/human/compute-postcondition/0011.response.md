The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 13,845. During each iteration, an integer input `x` is read and appended to the list `a`. After all iterations are complete, `a` will contain `n` integers, which are the values input during each iteration. The variable `i` will equal `n - 1` after the last iteration. If `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute exactly `n` times.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` contains `n` integers input by the user.**
