The code initializes an empty list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and retains its previous integer value within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 13,845; `a` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 13,845; `a` is an empty list**
