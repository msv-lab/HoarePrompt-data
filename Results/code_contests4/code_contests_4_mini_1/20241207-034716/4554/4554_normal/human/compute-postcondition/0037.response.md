The value of `b` is being updated by appending the value of `a[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 1, and thus `b` will receive the value of `a[1]`. The values of `n`, `count`, and `a` are not directly affected by this line of code, so the output state will reflect the current values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 1; `count` is incremented by 1; `b` is updated to include `a[1]`; `a[1]` remains unchanged.**
