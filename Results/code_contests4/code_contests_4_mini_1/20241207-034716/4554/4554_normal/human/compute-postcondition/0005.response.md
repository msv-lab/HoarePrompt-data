According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
