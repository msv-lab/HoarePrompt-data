According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed for the first time. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1 to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
