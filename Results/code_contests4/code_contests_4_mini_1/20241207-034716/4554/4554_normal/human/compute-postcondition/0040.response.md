According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
