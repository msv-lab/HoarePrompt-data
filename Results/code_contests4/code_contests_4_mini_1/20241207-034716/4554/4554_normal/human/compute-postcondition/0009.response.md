The value of `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation, but the value of `x` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 2; `x` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 2; `x` is an input integer**
