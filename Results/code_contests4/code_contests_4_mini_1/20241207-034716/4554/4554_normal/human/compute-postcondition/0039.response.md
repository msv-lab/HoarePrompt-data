Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1. If `count` is even, `b` is updated to include `a[1]`, and `a[1]` remains unchanged. If `count` is odd, `b` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is even, `b` is appended with `a[i] / 2`.***
