Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 0; if `a[i]` is an odd integer, then if `count` is even, `a[i]` is updated to `(a[i] // 2) + 1`, `b` is updated with this new value of `a[i]`, and `count` remains an odd integer. If `a[i]` is even, then `b` remains unchanged, and `a[i]` and `count` retain their original values.***
