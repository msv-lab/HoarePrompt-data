The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will accept user input and convert it to an integer. The initial state of the variable `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unaffected in this step. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` is now an input integer, while the values of `n` and `i` remain as they were.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 1; `x` is an input integer**
