`a` is a list that will have `x` appended to it. The value of `x` is an input integer, but its specific value is not known at this point. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 2; and `a` now contains `x` as a new element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 2; `a` now contains `x` as a new element.**
