The variable `b` is initialized as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `a`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` contains `n` integers input by the user; `b` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` contains `n` integers input by the user; `b` is an empty list.**
