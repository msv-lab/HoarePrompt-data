The code `count = count + 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous value of `count` is not provided, but it will be increased by 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, `a[i]`, and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the increment of `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 1; `count` is incremented by 1; `b` remains unchanged.**
