Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845 and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is odd, `count` is increased by 1. If `count` is odd, an element is appended to `b` from `a[2]`, which is modified to `a[2] / 2 + 1`. If `count` is even, there is no change to `b`. If `a[i]` is even, there are no changes to `b`.***
