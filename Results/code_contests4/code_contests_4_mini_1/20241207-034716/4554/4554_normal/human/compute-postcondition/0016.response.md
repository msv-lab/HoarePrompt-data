The value of `a[i]` is divided by 2 and appended to the list `b`. Since `a[i]` is even, the result of the division will be an integer. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is even, and a new element has been appended to `b` which is `a[i] / 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is even, and a new element has been appended to `b` which is `a[i] / 2.**
