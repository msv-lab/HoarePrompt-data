The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 13,845, but the specific input value is not determined. Other variables (`a_i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 13,845**
