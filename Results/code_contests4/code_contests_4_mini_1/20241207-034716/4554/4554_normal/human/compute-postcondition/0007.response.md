The code appends the value of `x` to the list `a`. The output state does not provide any information about the previous state of the list `a`, but we know that `x` is an input integer. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `x` to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 13,845; `i` is 1; `x` is an input integer; `a` now includes `x`**
