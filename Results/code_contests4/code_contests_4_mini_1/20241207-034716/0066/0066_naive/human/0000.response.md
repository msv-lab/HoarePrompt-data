To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly identifies if there is a sequence of five platforms with equal spacing between them.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to identify if there are five platforms ('*') in the string such that the intervals between them are equal.
2. The program should return "yes" if such a configuration exists and "no" otherwise.

### Analyzing the Program:
Here's the relevant part of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    for j in xrange(1, len(s)):
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            if i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*':
                return True
    return False
```

### Breakdown of the Logic:
- The outer loop iterates over the possible jump lengths `j` starting from 1 up to the length of the string.
- The inner loop iterates over each starting index `i` in the string.
- The condition checks whether the characters at positions `i`, `i+j`, `i+2*j`, `i+3*j`, and `i+4*j` are all platforms ('*').
- If such a sequence is found, it returns `True`, else it continues until all possibilities are exhausted.

### Potential Issues:
1. The range for `j` is from 1 to `len(s)`, which is correct because we need at least one segment of space for each jump.
2. The condition `i + 4 * j < len(s)` ensures that we do not go out of bounds when checking the characters.
3. The check for `'*'` at the required indices seems correct.

### Edge Case:
However, there is a potential issue related to the handling of very short strings or strings without enough platforms. For instance:
- If the string has fewer than five segments, it should immediately return "no".
- If there are not enough '*' characters to form a valid sequence, the program may not cover that correctly.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Consider the input:
```
5
.....
```
This should return "no" since there are no platforms ('*') at all.

Another case:
```
4
*.*.*
```
Should also return "no" because there aren't five platforms.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and potential edge cases, the program does not handle cases where there are fewer than five segments or not enough platforms correctly. Therefore, even if it works for the provided examples, it may fail in edge scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
