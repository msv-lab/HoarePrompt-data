#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) consisting of characters '*' and '.', where '*' represents a platform and '.' represents a pit.
def func_1(s):
    for j in xrange(1, len(s)):
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            if i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j
                ] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*':
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `j` is equal to the maximum value of `j` that the loop can reach (which is at most `floor(n/4)`), `i` is equal to `len(s)`, and the function returns True if there are five consecutive '*' characters at intervals of `j` in `s`, or False if no such conditions were satisfied during the iterations. If the length of `s` is less than 5, `j` is 1 and `i` is 0, and the function does not return anything.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no five consecutive '*' characters at intervals of j in the string s.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing characters '*' and '.'. It checks for the presence of five consecutive '*' characters at intervals of `j` where `j` varies from 1 up to the maximum possible value such that the indices remain within the bounds of the string. It returns `True` if such a sequence is found, and `False` if no such sequence exists. If the length of `s` is less than 5, the function will always return `False` since there aren't enough characters to satisfy the condition.
