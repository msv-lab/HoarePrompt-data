According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i` compared to the length of the string `s`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and it is given that `s` is a string of length greater than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

After the current iteration, `i` becomes `n`, and since the condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` should be less than `len(s)`, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than `n`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` becomes `n`, and `s` must still be a string of length greater than `n`. 

State: **`s` is a string of length greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `len(s)` must be greater than `n`.**
