According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as the variable `i` is less than the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. 

Additionally, we need to ensure that the loop can continue executing, which means `i + 4 * j` must still be less than the length of `s`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, the condition becomes `2 + 4 * n < len(s)` for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `2 + 4 * j` must be less than the length of `s`**.
