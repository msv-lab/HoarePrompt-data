According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`, specifically its length. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `len(s)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, which means that `i` is `n`. Since the loop starts with `j` equal to 1 and goes up to `len(s) - 1`, if `i` is equal to `n`, the last value of `j` would be `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `n`, which means that `j` should be incremented to `n`.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be equal to `n`**
