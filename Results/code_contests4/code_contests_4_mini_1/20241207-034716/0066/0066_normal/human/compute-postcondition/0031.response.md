Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length greater than `n`, and `i` is `n`. If `i + 4 * j` is less than `len(s)` and the characters at positions `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` in `s` are all equal to '*', the program returns True, confirming that the loop's execution condition is satisfied.***
