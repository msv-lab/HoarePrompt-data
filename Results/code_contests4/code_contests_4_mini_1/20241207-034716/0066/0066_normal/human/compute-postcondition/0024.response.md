According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `len(s)`, which is the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, which means the loop has completed without returning True, indicating there were no five consecutive '*' characters at intervals of `j` in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and since `j` is currently `n`, it will become `n + 1`. 

Additionally, the loop's range is from `1` to `len(s) - 1` (since `xrange` is used), and to execute the loop a second time, `j` must be less than `len(s)`, which means `n + 1` must be less than `len(s)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be `n + 1`, and there should be at least `n + 1` characters in `s`.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n + 1` must be less than `len(s)`**.
