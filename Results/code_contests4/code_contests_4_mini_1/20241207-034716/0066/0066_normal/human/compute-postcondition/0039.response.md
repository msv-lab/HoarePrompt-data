Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing characters '*' and '.'. It checks for the presence of five consecutive '*' characters at intervals of `j` where `j` varies from 1 up to the maximum possible value such that the indices remain within the bounds of the string. It returns `True` if such a sequence is found, and `False` if no such sequence exists. If the length of `s` is less than 5, the function will always return `False` since there aren't enough characters to satisfy the condition. **
