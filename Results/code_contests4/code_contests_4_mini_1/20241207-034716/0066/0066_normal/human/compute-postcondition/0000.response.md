According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `s`. Since the loop starts at `j = 1` and goes up to `len(s)`, the loop will execute if the length of `s` is at least 2. If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute because there are no valid indices for `j` in the range specified. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The variable `j` should be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
