Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `j` is equal to the maximum value of `j` that the loop can reach (which is at most `floor(n/4)`), `i` is equal to `len(s)`, and the function returns True if there are five consecutive '*' characters at intervals of `j` in `s`, or False if no such conditions were satisfied during the iterations. If the length of `s` is less than 5, `j` is 1 and `i` is 0, and the function does not return anything.**
