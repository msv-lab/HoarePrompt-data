Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) and `i` is 1. If `i + 4 * j` is less than the length of `s` and all characters `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, and `s[i + 4 * j]` are equal to '*', the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
