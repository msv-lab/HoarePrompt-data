According to the code, the loop is controlled by the length of the string `s`, which is `n`. The variable `i` starts at `n`, which is equal to the length of `s`. In Python, the range for the loop will produce values from `0` to `n-1`, meaning the loop will not execute if `i` starts at `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `0` to allow the loop to execute for the first time. Additionally, since `j` must equal `n` for the loop to execute one more time, we can assume the same condition holds.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be equal to `n`**
