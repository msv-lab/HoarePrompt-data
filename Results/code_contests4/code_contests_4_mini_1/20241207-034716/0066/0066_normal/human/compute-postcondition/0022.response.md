Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, and `j` is equal to `n`. If `i + 4 * j` is less than the length of `s` and the characters at positions `i`, `i + j`, `i + 2 * j`, `i + 3 * j`, and `i + 4 * j` are all equal to '*', the function returns True. If these conditions are not met, the function does not return any value.***
