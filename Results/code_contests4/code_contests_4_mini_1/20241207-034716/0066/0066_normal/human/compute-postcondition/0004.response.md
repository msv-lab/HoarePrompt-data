Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Either `i + 4 * j` is greater than or equal to `len(s)`, or at least one of the characters `s[i]`, `s[i + j]`, `s[i + 2 * j]`, `s[i + 3 * j]`, `s[i + 4 * j]` is not equal to '*'.***
