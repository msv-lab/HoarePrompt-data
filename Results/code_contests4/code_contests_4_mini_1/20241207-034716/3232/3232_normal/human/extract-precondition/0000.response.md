Precondition: **The input consists of multiple datasets where each dataset begins with a non-negative integer n (0 <= n <= 10,000) followed by n lines each containing two time strings in the format "hh:mm:ss" representing departure and arrival times at Osaki Station. The input terminates with a line containing n = 0, which is not part of the datasets. Each time value follows the constraints: 0 ≤ hh < 24, 0 ≤ mm < 60, 0 ≤ ss < 60.**
