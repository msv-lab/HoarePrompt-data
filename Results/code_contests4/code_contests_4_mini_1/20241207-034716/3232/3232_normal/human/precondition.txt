The input consists of multiple datasets, where each dataset starts with an integer n (1 <= n <= 10,000) indicating the number of trains, followed by n lines each containing two timestamps in the format hh:mm:ss representing the departure and arrival times at Osaki Station. Each timestamp has hours (0 ≤ hh < 24), minutes (0 ≤ mm < 60), and seconds (0 ≤ ss < 60), and the departure time is always before the arrival time. The input ends with n = 0, which should not be processed.
