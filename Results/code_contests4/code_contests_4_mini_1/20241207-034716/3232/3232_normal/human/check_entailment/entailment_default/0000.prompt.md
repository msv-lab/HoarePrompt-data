You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Osaki

Osaki

English text is not available in this practice contest.

The Yamanote Line is a circular railway line laid in the 23 wards of Tokyo. The total route distance is 34.5km, and one lap takes about one hour. There are 29 stations in total. The line color is Uguisu color. The peak congestion rate exceeds 200%, making it one of the busiest railway lines in Japan. One train runs every three minutes during the busiest hours, and people who come to Tokyo for the first time are amazed at the sight.

Mr. Tetsuko loves the Yamanote Line and loves genuine railways. One day, she came up with the following question while reading her favorite book, the JR timetable. "How many vehicles are used a day on the Yamanote Line?"

She tried to figure out the minimum number of vehicles required for operation from the timetable. However, the number of trains was so large that she couldn't count it by herself. So she turned to you, a good programmer, for help.

Your job is to write a program to find the minimum number of cars required to operate the Yamanote Line from a given timetable. Since the Yamanote Line is a circular line, the timetable is often written with "Osaki Station" as the starting and ending stations for convenience. Therefore, only the departure and arrival times of each train at Osaki Station are recorded in the timetable given by her.

Although this cannot happen on the actual Yamanote Line, in order to simplify the situation setting, we will consider that the train can depart from Osaki Station immediately after it arrives at Osaki Station. In addition, there are cases where the time taken by Mr. Tetsuko is incorrect, or the train added by Mr. Tetsuko's delusion is mixed in the timetable, but you can not see them, so to the last The number must be calculated for the time as written.

If you write a program that works, she may invite you to a date on the train. However, it is up to you to accept or decline the invitation.

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset has the following format.

> n
> hh: mm: ss hh: mm: ss
> hh: mm: ss hh: mm: ss
> ...
> hh: mm: ss hh: mm: ss

The integer n in the first line is the number of trains included in the timetable. This value is guaranteed not to exceed 10,000. The departure time and arrival time of each train at Osaki Station are given in this order on the n lines from the 2nd line to the n + 1st line, and the departure time and arrival time are separated by a single space. Each time is expressed in the format hh: mm: ss, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The range of each value is 0 ≤ hh <24, 0 ≤ mm <60, 0 ≤ ss <60. All of these numbers are prefixed with 0s as needed to be two digits.

Trains that run across 24:00 at night are not included. Therefore, the departure time is always before the arrival time.

The end of input is indicated by n = 0. It is not included in the dataset.

Output

For each dataset, output the minimum number of vehicles required on one line.

m = 24 * 60 * 60
while True:
    n = int(raw_input())
    if n == 0:
        break
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, d) = raw_input().split()
        (a, b, c) = map(int, a.split(':'))
        (d, e, f) = map(int, d.split(':'))
        dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c] += 1
        dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f] -= 1
    for i in range(m):
        dp[i + 1] += dp[i]
    print(max(dp))
```
Output hints: The function processes multiple datasets containing non-negative integers followed by pairs of departure and arrival times in "hh:mm:ss" format. For each dataset, it calculates the maximum number of overlapping events at any point in time and prints this maximum. The input terminates when a dataset begins with the integer 0. The function does not handle any input errors or invalid time formats explicitly.

First I want you to try to see if the code does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code must exactly follow the problem description for all cases to be correct.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
