Functionality: ** The function processes multiple datasets containing non-negative integers followed by pairs of departure and arrival times in "hh:mm:ss" format. For each dataset, it calculates the maximum number of overlapping events at any point in time and prints this maximum. The input terminates when a dataset begins with the integer 0. The function does not handle any input errors or invalid time formats explicitly. **
