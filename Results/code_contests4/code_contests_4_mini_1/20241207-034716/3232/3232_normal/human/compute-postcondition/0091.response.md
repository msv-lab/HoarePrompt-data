`dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. Since `i` is 0, this means `dp[1]` will be updated by adding `dp[0]`. Given that `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, `dp[0]` is 0. Therefore, `dp[1]` remains 0 after the operation. The other variables `n` and `m` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, and `dp[1]` is updated to 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, and `dp[1]` is updated to 0.**
