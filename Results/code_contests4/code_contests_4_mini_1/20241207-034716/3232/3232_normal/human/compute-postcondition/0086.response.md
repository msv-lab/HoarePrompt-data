The code assigns the values of `d`, `e`, and `f` from the result of splitting the string `d` by the colon `:` and converting the resulting parts into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `d` is being split into three parts, so we assume `d` can contain at least two colons to result in three values. Since `n` is greater than 1 and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are derived from the split of `a`, we do not have specific values for `d`, `e`, and `f`, but we can infer that they will be integers.

The output state mentions the new values of `d`, `e`, and `f` and indicates that they have been assigned from the split operation. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is the first part of the input; `b` and `c` are integers derived from the split of `a; d`, `e`, and `f` are integers derived from the split of `d`.**
