According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The value of `m` being 86400 and `dp` being a list of 86401 zeros does not influence the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and the loop variable `_` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
