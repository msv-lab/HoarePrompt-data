According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `m` is 86400, and `i` is 0 (as it starts from 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, thus `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, it must be noted that `m` is still 86400.

State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, `dp[1]` is 0, `dp[2]` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 1 and `m` must be greater than 1**
