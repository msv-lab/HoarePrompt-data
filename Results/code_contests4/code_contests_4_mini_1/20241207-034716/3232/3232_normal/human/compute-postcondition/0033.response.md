The code executes the `print(max(dp))` statement, which finds the maximum value in the list `dp`. The value of `m` (86400) does not affect this operation, and `dp` is used to determine the output. Since `dp` contains cumulative sums of its initial values and `dp[0]` remains unchanged, we are interested in the maximum value within `dp`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums, and the maximum value in `dp` is printed.
Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums, and the maximum value in `dp` is printed.**
