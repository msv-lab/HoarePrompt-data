The code extracts three integers from the string `a`, which is expected to be formatted as a time in the form of "HH:MM:SS". The values of `b` and `c` will be assigned from the corresponding parts of this time. The previous values of `m`, `dp`, `n`, and `_` are not affected, but now `a` will be transformed into three integer variables. 

Assuming the input string `a` is correctly formatted, `b` will represent the hours, `c` will represent the minutes, and the value for seconds will be discarded since it's not part of the assignment.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` and `d` are input strings split from the raw input; `a`, `b`, `c` are integers extracted from `a` formatted as "HH:MM:SS".**
