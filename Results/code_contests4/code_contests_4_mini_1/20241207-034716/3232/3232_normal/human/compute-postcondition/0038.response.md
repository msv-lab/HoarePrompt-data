The code initializes the list `dp` with a length of `m + 1`, where `m` is 86400. This means `dp` will be a list with 86401 elements, all initialized to 0. The previous values of `dp` are not specified but are relevant as it is being created anew. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros**
