The code takes the input string `a`, splits it using the colon `:` as a delimiter, and then maps the resulting parts to integers. This means `a` should be in the format of "hours:minutes:seconds". The initial state does not specify the actual value of `a`, so we cannot determine the exact values of `b` and `c`. 

The variable `m` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the impact of the code on the variables involved.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `a` is an input string; `b` and `c` are integers derived from splitting `a` by ':'**
