The line of code `a, b, c = map(int, a.split(':'))` takes the input string `a`, splits it by the colon character `':'`, and converts the resulting substrings into integers, assigning them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state indicates that `a` is an input string. Therefore, after executing this line, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will depend on the format of the input string. 

Since `a` was a string from `raw_input()`, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` cannot be determined without knowing the input. However, `b` and `c` will hold the respective integer values derived from the input string.

The state of `m` and `dp` remains unchanged since they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` is a list with 86401 elements initialized to 0, `a` is an input string, `b` and `c` are integers derived from splitting `a` by ':'**
