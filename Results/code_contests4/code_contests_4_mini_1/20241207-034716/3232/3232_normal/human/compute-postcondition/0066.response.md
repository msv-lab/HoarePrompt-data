Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely, regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute again.

State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums up to index `m`, `n` is 86400, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` are integers derived from the last input strings processed, and the maximum value of `dp` is printed.**
