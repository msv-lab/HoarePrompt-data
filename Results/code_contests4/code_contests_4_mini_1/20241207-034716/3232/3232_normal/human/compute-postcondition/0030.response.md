According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is 86400. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Hence, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. Since `m` is still 86400, the loop can execute again.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
