The code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` is designed to update the list `dp` at the index `i + 1` by adding the value at index `i`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 2, but the current values of `dp` are not provided. Since `m` is 86400 and is greater than 2, the loop can execute a second time.

However, we cannot determine the previous value of `dp[i]` without additional context. Therefore, we can state that the value of `dp[i + 1]` will increase by whatever value is currently in `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2; `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]`.**
