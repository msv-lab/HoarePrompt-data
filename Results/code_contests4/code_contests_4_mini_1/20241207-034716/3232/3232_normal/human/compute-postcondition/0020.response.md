The values of `a` and `d` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, which splits the input into two separate string variables. The initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `d`, so they will take on values based on user input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400; `a` is an input string; `d` is an input string.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `a` is an input string; `d` is an input string**
