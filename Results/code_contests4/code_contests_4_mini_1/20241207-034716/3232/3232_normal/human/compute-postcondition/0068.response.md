The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums up to index `m`, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` are integers derived from the last input strings processed, and the maximum value of `dp` is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
