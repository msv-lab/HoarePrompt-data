The code `print(max(dp))` computes the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains 86401 zeros. Since all elements in `dp` are zeros, the maximum value is 0. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, and the maximum of `dp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, and the maximum of `dp` is 0.**
