The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It processes multiple datasets where each dataset begins with a non-negative integer `n` (0 <= n <= 10,000), followed by `n` lines, each containing two time strings in the format "hh:mm:ss" that represent departure and arrival times at Osaki Station. The input terminates with a line containing `n = 0`, which is not part of the datasets. After processing the input, the function generates output based on the provided time data. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of departure and arrival times from Osaki Station, outputting results based on the time data provided, while handling datasets until a terminating condition is met with `n = 0`.**
