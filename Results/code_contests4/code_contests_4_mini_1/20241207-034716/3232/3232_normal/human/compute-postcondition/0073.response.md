`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values obtained by splitting the string `a` by the colon `:` and converting each part to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `a` is affected by this operation, and `b` and `c` are newly defined variables based on the split values of `a`. The values of `b` and `c` depend on the specific format of the input string `a`. Other variables (`n` and `d`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute; `a` is split into `b` and `c` as integers.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute; `a` is split into `b` and `c` as integers.**
