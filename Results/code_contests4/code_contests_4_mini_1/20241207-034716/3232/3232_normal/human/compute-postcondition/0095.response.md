The code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` updates the `dp` list at the index `i + 1` by adding the value at the index `i`. Given the initial state where `n` is 0, `m` is 86400, and `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, with `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` specifically being 0, we know that `i` must be 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

Since `i` is 1, the code evaluates `dp[1 + 1] += dp[1]`, which translates to `dp[2] += dp[1]`. Both `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are 0, so the operation results in `dp[2]` still being 0 after the addition.

The states of other variables (`n`, `m`, `dp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values in the `dp` list.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, `dp[1]` is 0, `dp[2]` is 0**
