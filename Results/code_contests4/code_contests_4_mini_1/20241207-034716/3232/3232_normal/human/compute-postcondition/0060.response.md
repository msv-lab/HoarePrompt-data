According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is 86400. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
