According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute one more time. After the last iteration, `n` will be decremented by 1 to allow for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
