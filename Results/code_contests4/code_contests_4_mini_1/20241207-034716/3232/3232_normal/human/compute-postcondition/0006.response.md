The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. Given that `m` is 86400, `dp` will have 86401 elements (from index 0 to 86400). The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400 and `dp` is a list with 86401 elements, all initialized to 0.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `dp` is a list with 86401 elements, all initialized to 0**
