The code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` updates the value at index `i + 1` of the list `dp` by adding the current value at index `i`. The previous value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. However, the value of `dp[i]` is not provided in the initial state, which means we cannot determine the exact numerical outcome for `dp[1]`. Therefore, while we know that `dp[1]` will be updated by adding `dp[0]`, we cannot specify the exact values.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 0, `dp[1]` is updated by adding `dp[0]`**
