The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `dp`, which means we cannot determine the exact values of `dp[i]` or `dp[i + 1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i + 1]` is increased by `dp[i]`, but the specific values remain unknown. 

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 0; `dp[i + 1]` is increased by `dp[i]` (values of `dp` are unknown)**
