`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `m` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is 86400; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`m` is 86400; `n` is an input integer**
