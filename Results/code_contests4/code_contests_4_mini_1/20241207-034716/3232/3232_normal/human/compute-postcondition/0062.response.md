According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is 86400. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
