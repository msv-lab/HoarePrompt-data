The code assigns new values to `d`, `e`, and `f` by splitting the string `d` at each colon (':') and converting the resulting substrings into integers using the `map` function. Since `d`, `e`, and `f` are integers assigned from the split string, their values will change based on the content of the original variable `d`. Other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new integer values of `d`, `e`, and `f` as derived from the split operation, along with the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `d`, `e`, `f` are the integers derived from splitting the original `d` string; `a` is an integer from the input split; `b` is an integer from the input split; `c` is an integer from the input split.**
