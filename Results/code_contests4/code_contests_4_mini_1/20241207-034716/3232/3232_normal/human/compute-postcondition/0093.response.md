The value of `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, we look at the previous values of the affected variables. Initially, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, so `dp[1]` is 0, and `dp[2]` is also 0. Therefore, after executing the code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]`, we have:

- `dp[2]` will be updated to `dp[2] + dp[1]`, which is `0 + 0`, resulting in `dp[2]` still being 0.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `dp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, `dp[1]` is 0, and `dp[2]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `m` is 86400, `dp` is a list of 86401 zeros, `dp[1]` is 0, `dp[2]` is 0**
