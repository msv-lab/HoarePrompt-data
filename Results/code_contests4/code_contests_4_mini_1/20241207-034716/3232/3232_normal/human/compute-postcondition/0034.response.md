Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute indefinitely without any condition to exit. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. The program state remains unchanged.

State: **`m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums, and the maximum value in `dp` is printed.**
