`dp[i + 1]` is increased by the value of `dp[i]`. The value of `i` is 2, so `dp[3]` is being updated with `dp[2]`. The value of `m` is 86400, which is greater than 2, allowing the loop to execute a second time. However, the specific values of `dp[i]` or `dp[i + 1]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the affected variables. 

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 2; `dp[3]` is increased by `dp[2]`**
