The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i]`. However, since the previous values of `dp` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact impact on `dp[i + 1]`. The values of `m` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the state of `m`, `i`, and the operation performed on `dp`.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i]`**
