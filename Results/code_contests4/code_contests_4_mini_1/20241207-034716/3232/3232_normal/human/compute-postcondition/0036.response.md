The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 86400, `dp` contains cumulative sums, the maximum value in `dp` is printed, and `n` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
