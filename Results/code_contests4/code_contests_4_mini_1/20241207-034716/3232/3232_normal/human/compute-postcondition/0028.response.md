According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is 86400. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Since `m` is 86400, which is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
