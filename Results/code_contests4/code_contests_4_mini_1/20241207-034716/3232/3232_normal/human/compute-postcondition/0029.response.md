The code `dp[i + 1] += dp[i]` updates the value of `dp[i + 1]` by adding the value of `dp[i]` to it. However, since the initial state does not provide any information about the `dp` array, we cannot determine specific values for `dp[i]` or `dp[i + 1]`. The state of the other variables (`m` is 86400 and `i` is 1) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 86400, `i` is 1, and `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding `dp[i]` to it, but specific values of `dp` are unknown.**
