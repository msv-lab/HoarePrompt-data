To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly finds a spanning tree of a given undirected unweighted connected graph such that the degree of vertex 1 is equal to D. 

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The graph is connected and undirected with no self-loops or multiple edges.
   - We need to check if there exists a spanning tree where vertex 1 has degree D.

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - If such a spanning tree exists, print "YES" followed by the edges of the tree.
   - If it does not exist, print "NO".

### Analysis of the Code:
- **Initial Degree Check:**
  The program first checks if the number of edges connected to vertex 1 (`len(dmain[1])`) is less than D. If it is, it prints "NO" and exits. This is a necessary check since we cannot have a degree higher than the number of edges available.

- **Finding Connected Components:**
  The program attempts to identify connected components starting from vertex 2. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to label connected components. However, it does not consider the necessary condition that after identifying all components, the number of components connected to vertex 1 must be sufficient to achieve degree D.

- **Degree Adjustment Logic:**
  The logic to adjust the edges connected to vertex 1 seems to be flawed. It tries to remove edges if the condition is not met, but it may not appropriately manage cases where there are not enough edges from other components to satisfy the degree requirement.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Insufficient Edges:**
   If vertex 1 has exactly D edges but other vertices have a higher degree, the program may incorrectly adjust edges without checking if it has enough remaining edges to maintain a valid spanning tree.

2. **Disconnected Components:**
   If the graph is not initially processed correctly to keep track of all connected components, the resulting spanning tree may not be valid.

3. **Exact Degree Cases:**
   If a vertex has exactly D edges but is not part of a valid tree structure due to the connection logic, the output might incorrectly suggest a valid spanning tree.

Based on these considerations, it is evident that the program may not correctly handle all the edge cases as specified in the problem description. 

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and potential edge cases that could lead to incorrect outputs, I conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
