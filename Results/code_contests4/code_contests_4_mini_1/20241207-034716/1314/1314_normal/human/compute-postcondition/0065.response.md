The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Given that `el` refers to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `tov` has one less element than before, we can conclude that `tov` will now have an additional element, which is `el`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one more element than before, `arr` remains unchanged, `el` refers to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one more element than before, `arr` remains unchanged, `el` refers to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1.**
