Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, and `tov` has one more element than before. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1, while `arr` remains unchanged in other cases.***
