`vis` is updated to include the element `el`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it. The previous state of `sv` is not detailed, but it is noted that `el` is now part of `vis`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + k + 2`, `sv` still contains `el`, and `vis` now includes `el`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k + 2`, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` now includes `el`**
