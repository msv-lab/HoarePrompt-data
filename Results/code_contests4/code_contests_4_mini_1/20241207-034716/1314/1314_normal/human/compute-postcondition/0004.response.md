The code initializes `dmain` as a `defaultdict` of sets. This creates a new variable `dmain` that will hold a dictionary where each key maps to a set, allowing for dynamic addition of elements to the sets associated with each key without raising a KeyError. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `D`, and `ds`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets, `dmain` is a defaultdict of sets**
