The variable `dmain[f]` is updated to include the value `s`. The previous state indicates that `ds[f]` contains `s`, and now `f` is added to the set associated with `dmain[s]`. The value of `dmain[f]` was previously unchanged, but now it contains the value of `s`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds[f]` contains `s`, `i` is 1, `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is an input integer not equal to 1; `dmain[f]` now includes `s`, and `f` is added to `dmain[s]`.**
