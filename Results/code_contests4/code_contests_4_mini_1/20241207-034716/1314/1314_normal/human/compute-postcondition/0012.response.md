Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets, `dmain` is updated with `f` added to the set at key `s`, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is an input integer not equal to 1, and `dmain[f]` now has `s` added to its set.**
