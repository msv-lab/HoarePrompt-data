Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` is a set containing the current values of `i` and `el`, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` is a valid key in `ds` containing at least 1 element. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.***
