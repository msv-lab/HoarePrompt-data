According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ds` and specifically the value of `nxt`. The loop will execute if `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element. 

Given that `nxt` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `ds` has an entry at index 2 and that this entry is a collection with at least one element. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following states need to be satisfied:
- `ds` must be a collection that has at least 3 entries (since indexing starts from 0).
- `ds[2]` must be a collection with at least one element.
- The variable `el` will represent the first element of `ds[nxt]` in the loop body.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` must have at least 3 entries and `ds[nxt]` (which is `ds[2]`) must contain at least one element**
