The code initializes a set named `tov` containing the current value of `i`. However, there is no information provided about the value of `i`, nor is there any operation that directly affects `n` or `cur`. The values of `n` and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`.**
