The code `dmain[el].remove(nxt)` attempts to remove the element `nxt` from the list or collection associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. Prior to this operation, the following conditions are confirmed:

- `dmain[nxt]` contains at least 1 element, indicating that `nxt` is indeed a valid element to be removed from `dmain[el]`.
- `el` is not in `vis`, meaning that the operation is valid and does not violate any constraints regarding visited elements.

As a result of executing this line of code, `dmain[el]` will have `nxt` removed from it. The values of `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `sviaz`, `vis`, and `res` remain unchanged as this operation only affects `dmain`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` contains 1 and `el`, `res` is `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`.**
