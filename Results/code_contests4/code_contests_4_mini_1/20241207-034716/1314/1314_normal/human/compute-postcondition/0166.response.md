According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(tov)` is greater than 0 since it is stated that `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, no adjustments are needed to the current states since `len(tov)` is already greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `nxt` is `i`, and `arr` has been updated such that all previously 0 values at indices corresponding to `tov` are set to `cur`.**
