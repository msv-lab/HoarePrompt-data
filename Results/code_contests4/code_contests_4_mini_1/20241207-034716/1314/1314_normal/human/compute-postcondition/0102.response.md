According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `cur` has been incremented by 1, we need to assess the current state of `el` and ensure that the loop can iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` has been incremented and `tov` contains the current values of `i` and `el`. 

The variable `el` would be the next element from `ds[nxt]` during the next iteration. Since `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element for the loop to execute again, we need to know that `el` is being updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. 

Given that `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element, the next state would reflect that `el` has been updated to the next element in the collection. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` is a set containing the current values of `i` and `el`, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 1 element.**
