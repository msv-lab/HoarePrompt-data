The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cur` is unknown. The value of `n` is greater than 2, so the condition for the loop to execute again depends on whether `n` remains greater than `i` after incrementing `cur`. However, since there is no information about `i`, we cannot determine if the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1**
