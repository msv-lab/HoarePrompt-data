Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` has been increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` now has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a list of at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. Otherwise, `arr[el]` remains unchanged.***
