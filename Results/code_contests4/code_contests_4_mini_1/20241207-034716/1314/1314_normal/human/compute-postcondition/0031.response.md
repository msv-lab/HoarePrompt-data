Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections. If the length of `dmain[1]` is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed and the program exits. If the length of `dmain[1]` is greater than or equal to `D`, the execution continues beyond this point without any specific action taken on this condition.***
