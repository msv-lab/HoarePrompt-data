Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m and m > 2), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds[f]` contains `s`, `i` is 2, `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, and `f` is an input integer not equal to 1. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `dmain[f]` includes `s`, `f` is added to `dmain[s]`, and `f` is added to the set `ds[s]`, while `s` is added to the set `ds[f]`.***
