The variable `tov` is assigned a set containing the value of `i`, which is currently set to 2. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `tov` and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections, `arr` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, the value of `arr[i]` is 0; `tov` is {2}.**
