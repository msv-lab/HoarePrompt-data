The value of `nxt` is assigned the value popped from the set `tov`, which originally contains the value 2. After executing the pop operation, `tov` will be empty, as sets do not maintain order and only one value is removed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections, `arr` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` is now empty, and `nxt` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections, `arr` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` is now empty, `nxt` is 2**.
