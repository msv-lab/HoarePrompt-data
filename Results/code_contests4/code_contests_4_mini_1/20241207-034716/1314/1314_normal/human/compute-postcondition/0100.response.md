The code `tov.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `tov`. Since the initial state indicates that `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`, the addition of `el` will modify `tov` to include `el` as well. The previous values of the affected variables are `tov` which is a set containing the current value of `i`, and `el` is an arbitrary element that will now be part of `tov`. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i` and `el`, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a valid key in `ds` and contains at least 1 element, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
