The value at index `el` in the array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`, which has been incremented by 1. Since `cur` is incremented but its previous value is not specified, we can only say that `arr[el]` will now hold the value of the incremented `cur`. The states of other variables (`n`, `tov`, `nxt`, and `ds[nxt]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a valid key in `ds` and contains at least 1 element, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
