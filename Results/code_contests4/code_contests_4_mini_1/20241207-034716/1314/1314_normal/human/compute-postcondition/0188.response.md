Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of the original `tov`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute, and `arr` has values updated to `cur` where they were originally 0. If `arr[el]` was 0, the element at index `el` in `arr` is now set to `cur`, and `el` is added to the set `tov`.***
