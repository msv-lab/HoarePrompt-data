The statement `tov.add(el)` adds the value `el` to the set `tov`. The variable `tov` now contains the additional element `el`, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated content of `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the number of elements assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` contains `el` and now includes the added element, `nxt` is the last element that was in `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to elements that were previously 0, and `arr[el]` is now assigned the value of `cur`.**
