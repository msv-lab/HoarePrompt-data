According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the entries in the `ds` list at the `nxt` index. Since `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, the loop can execute again for the next element in `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is 1, `i` is 2, and `el` has been processed from `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to make sure that `el` increments to the next value in `ds[nxt]`. This means that `el` will take on the next element in the list at `ds[nxt]`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements to iterate over in `ds[nxt]`.

So, if `ds[nxt]` has at least 3 entries (as mentioned), and we have processed one already, then we need to ensure that `el` refers to the next entry in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one less element, and `arr` remains unchanged, `el` refers to the next element in `ds[nxt]`**
