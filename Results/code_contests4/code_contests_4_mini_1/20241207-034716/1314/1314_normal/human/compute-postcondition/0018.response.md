Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds[f]` contains `s`, `i` is 1, `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is an input integer not equal to 1; `s` is added to the set associated with `ds[f]`, and `f` is added to the set associated with `dmain[s]`.**
