Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` now contains `el` and possibly other unique values, `vis` contains 1 and `el` and now also contains `el`, `res` is `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`, and for the loop to execute again, `dmain[nxt]` must have at least one more element.**
