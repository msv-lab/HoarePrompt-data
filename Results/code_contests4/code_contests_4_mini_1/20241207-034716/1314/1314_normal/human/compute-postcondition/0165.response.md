Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`, `nxt` is `i`, and `arr` has been updated such that all previously 0 values at indices corresponding to `tov` are set to `cur`.**
