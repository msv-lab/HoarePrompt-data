The code `arr[el] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` of the array `arr`. Given the initial state, `cur` is 1, and the element at index `el` of `arr` is currently 0. After executing the code, the value at `arr[el]` changes from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element, and `arr[el]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element, and `arr[el]` is now 1.**
