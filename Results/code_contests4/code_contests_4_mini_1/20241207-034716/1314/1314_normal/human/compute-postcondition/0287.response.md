The `res` list is modified by appending a new string that combines the values of `nxt` and `el`. The previous state of `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed. The new string added is `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`, where `nxt` is the next unique index or value from `dmain` and `el` is the unique value being processed. The other variables remain unchanged, and no other calculations are performed.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` now includes `el`, `res` now contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed and the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`.**
