The `vis` set is updated to include the new element `el`. Since `vis` already contains 1 and all unique `el` values that have been added previously, the addition of `el` will either keep the set the same if `el` is already present or add a new unique value if `el` is not in `vis`. The values of `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `res` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values plus potentially the new `el`, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed.
