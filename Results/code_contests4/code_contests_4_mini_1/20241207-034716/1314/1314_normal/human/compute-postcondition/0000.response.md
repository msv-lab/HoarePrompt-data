Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), and the edges are given as pairs of integers (v_i, u_i) where 1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n and v_i ≠ u_i, ensuring there are no self-loops or multiple edges; `sys.stdin` is set to read from a byte stream.**
