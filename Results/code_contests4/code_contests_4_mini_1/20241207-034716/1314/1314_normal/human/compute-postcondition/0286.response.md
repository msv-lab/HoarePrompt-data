The variable `vis` now includes the unique value `el` by executing `vis.add(el)`. The previous contents of `vis` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `el` to `vis`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` now includes `el`, `res` still contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, and now also contains the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)` if `el` is the next unique value from `dmain[nxt]`.**
