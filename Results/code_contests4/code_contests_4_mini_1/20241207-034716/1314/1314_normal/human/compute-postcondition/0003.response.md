The code initializes `ds` as a `defaultdict` of type `set`. This means `ds` will be a dictionary where each key maps to a set, and if a key doesn't exist, it will automatically create an empty set for that key upon first access. The existing values of `n`, `m`, and `D` are not altered by this line of code, and no additional computations or assignments occur.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets**
