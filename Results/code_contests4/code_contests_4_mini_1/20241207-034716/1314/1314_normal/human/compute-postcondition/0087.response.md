To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the initial state and the loop code provided.

1. **Understanding the initial state**:
   - `n` is greater than 2, indicating a positive integer value.
   - `i` starts at 2 and increments.
   - `cur` begins as 1.
   - `nxt` is defined as the last unique element from `tov`, which has one less unique element than it originally had.
   - `tov` has unique elements.
   - `ds` contains at least 3 entries.
   - `arr` has 1 at all indices corresponding to elements added to `tov` and remains unchanged elsewhere.

2. **Understanding the loop**:
   - The loop iterates over elements in `ds[nxt]`.
   - If `arr[el]` is 0, it sets `arr[el]` to `cur`, which is 1, and adds `el` to `tov`.

3. **Determining the output state**:
   - After the loop executes, `arr` will contain 1 at the indices corresponding to all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 and are now changed.
   - `tov` will include all unique elements added from `ds[nxt]`, meaning it will have additional elements based on the number of unique elements encountered in `ds[nxt]`.
   - The variable `i` would have been incremented for each unique element processed in `ds[nxt]`, and thus it will be at least `2 + k` where `k` is the number of unique elements processed.
   - `cur` remains 1 throughout the loop.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - At the end, if `ds[nxt]` had `m` unique elements and all were processed, `i` would have incremented accordingly.
   - The final values will denote that `tov` now contains all elements from the loop and that `arr` has been modified correspondingly.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least 2 plus the number of unique elements processed from `ds[nxt]`, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `tov` has new unique elements added from `ds[nxt]`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, and `arr` contains 1 at all indices that correspond to the elements added to `tov` while remaining unchanged elsewhere.**
