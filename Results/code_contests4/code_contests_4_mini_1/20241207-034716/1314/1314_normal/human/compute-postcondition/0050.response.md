Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1, and `el` has been added to `tov`.***
