The value of `el` is added to the set `vis`. Since `vis` already contains the value `1` and `el`, the addition of `el` will not change `vis` if it is already present. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `vis` remains unchanged. The other variables and their states remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed (remains unchanged), `vis` contains 1 and `el`, `res` is `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`, and `sv` now also contains `el`, and `vis` remains unchanged after adding `el`.**
