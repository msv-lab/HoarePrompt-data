The `tov` set is updated to add the element `el`, which is a unique element derived from `ds[nxt]`. Since `el` is being added to `tov`, the output state reflects this change, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `el` is the next unique element in `ds[nxt]`, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `tov` now includes `el`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, and `arr` contains 1 at index `el`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `el` is the next unique element in `ds[nxt]`, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `tov` now includes `el`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, and `arr` contains 1 at index `el`.**
