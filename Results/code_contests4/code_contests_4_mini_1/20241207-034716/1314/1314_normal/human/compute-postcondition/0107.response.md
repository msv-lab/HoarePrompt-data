Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` now contains at least the values of `i`, `el`, and `el` added, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 2 elements, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` (if `arr[el]` was equal to 0).**
