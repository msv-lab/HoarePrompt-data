According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nxt` and the structure of `ds`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `cur` is 1, and `ds` has at least 3 entries. The loop iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nxt` should be a valid index for `ds` and should point to a sublist with at least one element. Given that `ds` has at least 3 entries, the next valid index is `nxt + 1`, so `nxt` will be adjusted accordingly.

Thus, if `nxt` is incremented by 1, it needs to be a valid index for `ds` to ensure the loop can run again. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is the next valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one more element than before, and `arr[el]` will be assigned the value of `cur` (1) if `arr[el]` is equal to 0.**
