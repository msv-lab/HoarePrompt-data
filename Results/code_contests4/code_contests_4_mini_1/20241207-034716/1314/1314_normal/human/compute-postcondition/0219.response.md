Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` is updated with `arr[el]`. Otherwise, `sviaz` is either updated with `arr[el]` or remains an empty set, with the value 1 removed from `dmain[el]`.***
