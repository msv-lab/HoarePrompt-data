Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged; if `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` contains `arr[el]` and `dmain[1]` contains at least 1 element, while `el` is the first element in `ite`. Otherwise, `sviaz` is an empty set and `dmain[1]` no longer contains element `el` after its removal.***
