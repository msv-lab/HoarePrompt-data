Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` may have had elements removed based on the intersection with `sviaz`, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` contains 1 and `el`, `res` is `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`, `nxt` is the popped value from `sv`, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least 1 element, and `el` is not in `vis`.**
