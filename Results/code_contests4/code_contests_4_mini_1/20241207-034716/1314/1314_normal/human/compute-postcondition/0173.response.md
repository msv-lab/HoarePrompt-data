According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ds[nxt]`. If `el` is an element in `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in `ds[nxt]` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` has been increased based on elements in `ds[nxt]`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty list.

Since `el` is the current element being iterated over in `ds[nxt]`, after the last iteration, `el` will need to be incremented to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element left to iterate over.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` has been increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty list, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 1 more element.**
