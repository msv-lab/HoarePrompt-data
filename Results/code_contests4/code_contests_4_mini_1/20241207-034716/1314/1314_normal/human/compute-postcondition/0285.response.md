The code `sv.add(el)` adds the unique value `el` to the set `sv`. Since `sv` is currently holding unique values and `el` is a new unique value being processed, it will now include this new value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the impact is solely on `sv`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el` added to it, `vis` remains unchanged, `res` still contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, and now it also contains the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)` if `el` is the next unique value from `dmain[nxt]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` remains unchanged, `res` still contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, and now it also contains the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)` if `el` is the next unique value from `dmain[nxt]`.**
