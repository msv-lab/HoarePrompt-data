According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element after the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `cur` has been incremented by the number of elements assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is the last element in `tov`, and `arr` has values assigned to elements that were previously 0. Since `arr[el]` is 0, `ds[nxt]` is still a valid key in `ds` and contains at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element. Therefore, `el` should refer to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and we can assume that `cur` would remain the same unless modified by the loop's body. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the number of elements assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` contains `el`, `nxt` is the last element that was in `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to elements that were previously 0, and for the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
