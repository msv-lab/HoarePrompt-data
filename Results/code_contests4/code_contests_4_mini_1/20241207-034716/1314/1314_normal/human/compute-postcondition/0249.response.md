The code appends a new string to the list `res`. The new string is created by converting the variables `nxt` and `el` to strings and concatenating them with a space in between. The previous value of `res` is `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`. After appending, `res` will contain one additional element, which is `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed (remains unchanged), `vis` contains 1 and `el`, `res` is now `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`, `sv` now also contains `el`, and `vis` remains unchanged after adding `el`.**
