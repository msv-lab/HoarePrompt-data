Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the number of elements assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` now includes the added element `el`, `nxt` is the next element in `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to elements that were previously 0. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. For the loop to execute a second time, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element.***
