Output State: **`i` is `n + k + m` (where `k` is the total number of unique elements processed from `dmain`), `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` contains all unique values from `dmain` that were encountered, `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values added during the loop, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, and `sv` is empty as it has been fully processed.**
