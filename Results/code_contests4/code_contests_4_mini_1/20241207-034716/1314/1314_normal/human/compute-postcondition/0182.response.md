According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `tov` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `len(tov)` is non-zero (it is implied as the loop is currently executing). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state of `tov` must remain such that it still contains unique elements.

Since no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop can continue executing, I will simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` contains unique elements added during the loop execution, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` may contain processed elements, and `arr` has values updated to `cur` where they were originally 0.**
