Functionality: ** The function processes a graph represented by edges, where it checks if the number of connections from vertex 1 is at least D. If not, it outputs 'NO' and exits. It performs a traversal to group connected nodes and checks if the number of unique groups exceeds D, outputting 'NO' if it does. Finally, it constructs and prints the connections starting from vertex 1, outputting 'YES' followed by the connections formed. The function does not accept parameters and operates on input read from standard input. **
