The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `i` is unknown (but it is an integer), we can't specify the exact value after the increment. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections, `arr` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `cur` is set to 1, `tov` is empty, `ds` has at least 3 entries, and `arr` contains 1 at all indices corresponding to elements that were in `ds` and had a value of 0 before the loop execution; `i` is increased by 1.
