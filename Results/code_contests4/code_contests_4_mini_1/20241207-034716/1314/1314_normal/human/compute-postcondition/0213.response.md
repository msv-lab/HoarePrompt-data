The code `dmain[1].remove(el)` removes the element `el` from the list or collection `dmain[1]`. The initial state indicates that `dmain[1]` contains at least one element, and `el` is the first element in `ite`, which is also in `sviaz`. After this operation, it is explicitly stated that `dmain[el]` no longer contains the element 1 after removal. The other variables remain unchanged, so their previous values are retained.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the removal of `el` from `dmain[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged; `sviaz` is an empty set, `dmain[1]` no longer contains element `el` after removal.**
