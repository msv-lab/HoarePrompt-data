Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + k`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` now contains 1 and all unique `el` values added including `el`, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, and now it also contains the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`, only if `el` was not previously in `vis`, while `nxt` is a valid key in `dmain` and `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one element. If `el` was already in `vis`, all other variables remain unchanged.***
