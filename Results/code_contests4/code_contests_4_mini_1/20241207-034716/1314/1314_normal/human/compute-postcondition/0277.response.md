To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the state provided and the for loop statement.

The loop is structured as follows:
```
for el in dmain[nxt]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

1. **Understanding the Dependencies**:
   - The loop iterates over `dmain[nxt]`. This means that for the loop to execute, `dmain[nxt]` must be iterable (i.e., it should be a list, set, or any collection type).
   - We need to ensure that `nxt` is a valid key in `dmain` and that `dmain[nxt]` contains elements to iterate over.

2. **State Analysis**:
   - The current state indicates that `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt` for all `el` processed. This suggests that `nxt` might have been removed from `dmain` in the context of previous operations. 
   - If `nxt` is not a key in `dmain`, or if `dmain[nxt]` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to ensure that `nxt` is a valid key in `dmain`.
   - We also need to ensure that `dmain[nxt]` is not empty, meaning it must contain at least one element.

Based on these considerations, the adjustments to the state can be made as follows:

State: **`i` is `n + k`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` no longer contains one unique value from `arr` that was encountered, `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values added, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, for the loop to execute `nxt` must be a valid key in `dmain` and `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one element.**
