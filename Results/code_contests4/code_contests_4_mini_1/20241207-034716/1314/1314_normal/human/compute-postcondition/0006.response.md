The values of `s` and `f` are assigned from the input, where `input().split(' ')` takes a space-separated string and converts it into a list of integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are unaffected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets, `dmain` is a defaultdict of sets, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets, `dmain` is a defaultdict of sets, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**
