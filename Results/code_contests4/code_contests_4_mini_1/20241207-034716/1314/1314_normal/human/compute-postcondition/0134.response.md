According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `ds[nxt]` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and the loop variable `el` is currently pointing to an element in `ds[nxt]`. To execute the loop one more time, we need to increment `el` to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
1. `el` must be incremented to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.
2. The length of `ds[nxt]` must be sufficient to allow for another iteration (i.e., `el` must be less than the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]`).

Since `el` is currently pointing to one of the elements in `ds[nxt]`, we can denote the next value of `el` as `el + 1`. Additionally, `ds[nxt]` must have at least `el + 2` elements for this next iteration to be valid (since the indexing is zero-based).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `el` is incremented to `el + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` must have at least `el + 2` elements.**
