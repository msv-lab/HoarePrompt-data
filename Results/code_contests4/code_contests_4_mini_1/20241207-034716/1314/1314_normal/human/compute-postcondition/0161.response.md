According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. Currently, `nxt` is `i`, and `ds[nxt]` is assumed to have at least 2 elements, which allows the loop to run. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` has been increased by 1, `tov` contains the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `nxt` is still `i`, and `el` has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `el` needs to reference the next element in `ds[nxt]`, which means that `ds[nxt]` must have at least 3 elements. 

Thus, after this iteration, `el` should be updated to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` must contain at least 3 elements for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` contains the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `nxt` is still `i`, `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 3 elements, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
