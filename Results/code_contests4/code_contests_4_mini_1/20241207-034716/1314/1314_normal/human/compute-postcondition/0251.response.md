Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `vis` contains 1 and `el`, and now also contains `el`, `sv` now also contains `el`, and `res` is now `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]` if `el` is not in `vis`. If `el` is in `vis`, the state remains unchanged.**
