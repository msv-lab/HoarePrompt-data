The variable `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is less than `n - 1`. The variable `tov` is a set containing `i`, which means `tov` currently includes the value of `i`. When the line `nxt = tov.pop()` is executed, it removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set `tov`. This means that `nxt` will be assigned the value of `i`, and `tov` will be empty after this operation.

The values of `n`, `cur`, and `arr[i]` are not directly affected by this operation, but we do know `tov` is modified. Therefore, the Output State reflects the changes:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is less than `n - 1; `cur` is increased by 1; `tov` is empty; `nxt` is `i`.**
