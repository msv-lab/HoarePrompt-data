The code `tov.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set or collection `tov`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and thus it is being added to `tov`. The values of `n`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`, `ds`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1; `el` has been added to `tov`.**
