According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the structure of the `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again for the next element in `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `cur` has been incremented by 1, and `el` has been updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. Since `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that it has at least one more element available.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `el` must be updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and the state of `cur` will remain the same, but `el` will be updated to point to the next index in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` now contains at least the values of `i`, `el`, and `el` added, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]` and `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 2 elements; if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
