According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ds` list and the value of `nxt`. The loop iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `ds[nxt]` must be a valid entry in `ds` that contains at least one element. Given that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2, these values do not directly affect the execution of the loop in terms of iteration.

However, we need to ensure that `nxt` accurately points to an index in `ds` that refers to a list with elements. Since `tov` has one less unique element, it is possible that `nxt` could point to an index that is out of bounds for `ds` or to an entry that is empty. To ensure the loop executes, we must confirm that `nxt` is a valid index in `ds` and that `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure:
1. `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`.
2. `ds[nxt]` has at least one element.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds` with at least one element in `ds[nxt]`, `tov` has one less unique element, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `arr` contains 1 at all indices corresponding to elements added to `tov` while remaining unchanged elsewhere.**
