The code `nxt = tov.pop()` removes the last element from the list `tov` and assigns it to the variable `nxt`. Since `tov` contains all unique elements added during the loop execution, after this operation, the size of `tov` will decrease by one. The variables `n`, `i`, `cur`, `ds`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes in `tov` and the assignment to `nxt`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is the last unique element from `tov`, `tov` has one less unique element, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `arr` contains 1 at all indices corresponding to elements added to `tov` while remaining unchanged elsewhere.**
