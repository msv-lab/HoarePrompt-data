The code `dmain[el].remove(1)` attempts to remove the element `1` from the list associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. This operation will affect the contents of `dmain`, specifically the list within `dmain[el]`, if `1` exists in that list.

Since other variables (`i`, `cur`, `tov`, `n`, `ite`) are not directly affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state remains focused on the operation of removing `1` from `dmain[el]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` remains empty, `n` is greater than 2, `ite` must have at least one more element to allow another iteration of the loop, and `1` has been removed from `dmain[el]` if it was present.**
