The value of `f` is added to the set associated with the key `s` in the `ds` defaultdict. Since `ds` is a defaultdict of sets, this operation adds `f` to the set without affecting the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets with `f` added to the set at key `s`, `dmain` is a defaultdict of sets, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is an input integer not equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets with `f` added to the set at key `s`, `dmain` is a defaultdict of sets, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is an input integer not equal to 1.**
