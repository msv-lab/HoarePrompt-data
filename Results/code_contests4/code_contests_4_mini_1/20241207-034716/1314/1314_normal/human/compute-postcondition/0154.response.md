The code assigns the value of `cur` to the element of the list `arr` at the index `el`. The initial state indicates that `cur` has been increased by 1, while `arr[el]` is currently 0. Therefore, after execution, `arr[el]` will take the value of `cur`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is `i`, `ds[nxt]` is non-empty, and the element of `arr` at index `el` is now `cur`.**
