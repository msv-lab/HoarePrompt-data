The code `tov.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `tov`. Since `tov` originally has one less unique element, after executing the code, `tov` will now contain `el` as a new unique element, assuming `el` was not already present in `tov`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds` with at least one element in `ds[nxt]`, `tov` now has `el` as an additional unique element, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `arr` contains 1 at index `el` and unchanged elsewhere.**
