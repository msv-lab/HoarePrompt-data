According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least one more element after the last iteration, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `cur` has been incremented by the number of elements that were assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` contains `el` and now includes the added element, and `nxt` is the last element that was in `tov`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to check if there is an additional element in `ds[nxt]`. If there is at least one more element in `ds[nxt]`, then `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]` and the loop will execute again. 

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `el` is now the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and we should ensure that `nxt` is still valid and points to an appropriate value within `tov`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the number of elements assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` contains `el` and now includes the added element, `nxt` is the next element in `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to elements that were previously 0, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one more element.**
