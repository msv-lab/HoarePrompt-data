The code assigns the value of `cur`, which is 1, to the position `el` in the array `arr`. Since `arr[el]` is equal to 0, it will be updated to 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`, `ds`, and `tov`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is the next valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one more element than before, and `arr[el]` is now 1.
