According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `tov` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(tov)` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute at least one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes again.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` contains all unique elements added during the loop execution, and `arr` contains 1 at all indices corresponding to elements added to `tov` while remaining unchanged elsewhere.**
