The variable `tov` is assigned a set containing the current value of `i`. The initial conditions specify that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is less than `n - 1`, which means `i` can take on values that are valid in relation to `n`. The variable `cur` is not directly affected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state reflects `tov` being a set containing the value of `i`, while `n`, `i`, and `cur` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is less than `n - 1; `cur` is increased by 1; `tov` is a set containing `i`.**
