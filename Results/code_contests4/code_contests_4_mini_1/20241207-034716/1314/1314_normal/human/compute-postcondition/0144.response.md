Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2. If `arr[i]` is equal to 0, then `cur` is incremented by the total number of elements that were assigned values from `arr` during all iterations, `tov` is empty, `arr` contains values assigned to all elements that were originally 0 and correspond to the elements in `ds` reachable from the initial `tov`, and `ds[nxt]` has been fully processed.***
