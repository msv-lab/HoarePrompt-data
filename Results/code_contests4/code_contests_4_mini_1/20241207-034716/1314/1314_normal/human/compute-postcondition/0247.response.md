The `sv` set is updated to include the value `el`. Since `sv` already contains unique values from the variable `arr`, the addition of `el` will either keep the set unchanged (if `el` is already present) or increase the size of the set by one (if `el` is not present). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed (remains unchanged), `vis` contains 1 and `el`, `res` is `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`, and `sv` now also contains `el`.
