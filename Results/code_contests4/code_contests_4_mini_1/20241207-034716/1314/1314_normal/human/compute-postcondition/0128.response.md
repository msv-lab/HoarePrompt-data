The `nxt` variable is assigned the value of the last element from the `tov` list, which is retrieved using the `pop()` method. This operation modifies the `tov` list by removing its last element. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0; `tov` now has one less element; `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`; `arr` contains values assigned to all elements that were previously 0 from `ds[nxt]`.
