The `tov.add(el)` operation adds the value of `el` to the `tov` set. Since `tov` has one more element than before, the previous state of `tov` is not specified, but we know it contains at least one element. The variables `n`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`, and `arr[el]` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is the next valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one more element than before, and `arr[el]` is now 1; `el` is added to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is the next valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one more element than before, and `arr[el]` is now 1; `el` is added to `tov`.**
