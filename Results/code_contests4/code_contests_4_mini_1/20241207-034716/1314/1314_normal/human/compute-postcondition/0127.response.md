According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(tov)` is greater than 0 since it is in the condition of the while loop. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without needing any adjustments to the state variables.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, `tov` contains all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 and have now been assigned the value of `cur`, `nxt` reflects the last element added to `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to all elements that were previously 0 from `ds[nxt]`.**
