The code `dmain[s].add(f)` adds the value of `f` to the set associated with the key `s` in the `dmain` defaultdict. The initial values of `s` and `f` are given as inputs that are not equal to 1, confirming that both will be valid for the addition to the set. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `i`) remain unaffected by this specific operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets with `f` added to the set at key `s`, `dmain` is updated with `f` added to the set at key `s`, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, and `f` is an input integer not equal to 1.**
