The variable `vis` is initialized as an empty set. Since `vis` was not previously defined, it has no effect on the values of other variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged; `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` may have had elements removed based on the intersection with `sviaz`; `sv` contains 1, and `vis` is an empty set.
