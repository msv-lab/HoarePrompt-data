The value of `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1. Since `el` is the first element of `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` was previously 0, after the execution, `arr[el]` changes from 0 to 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one less element, `arr` remains unchanged, `el` is the first element of `ds[nxt]`, and the value of `arr[el]` is now 1.
