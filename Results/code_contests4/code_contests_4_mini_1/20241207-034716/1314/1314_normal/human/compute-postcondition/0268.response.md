According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `dmain[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, meaning it has already incremented past the value of `n`, and `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`. The variable `tov` is empty, and `n` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `dmain[el]` has had `nxt` removed from it, which means that `dmain[nxt]` may have fewer elements than before, and we need to check its size. The loop will execute again if it has at least one element left.

Thus, if `dmain[nxt]` originally had at least one element, it will still need to contain at least one element for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is `n + 1`, it will need to increment again for the next iteration, leading it to become `n + 2`.

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, for the loop to execute again `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element.**
