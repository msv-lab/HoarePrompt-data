The code snippet adds the value of `arr[el]` to the set `sviaz`. The initial state indicates that `sviaz` is an empty set and that the value of `arr[el]` is not already in `sviaz`. Therefore, after executing the code, `sviaz` will now contain the value of `arr[el]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged; `sviaz` contains `arr[el]`, `dmain[1]` contains at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ite`, and the value of `arr[el]` is not in the previous `sviaz`.**
