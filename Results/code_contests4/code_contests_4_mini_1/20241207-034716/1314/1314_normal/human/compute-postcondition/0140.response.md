The `tov.add(el)` method is called, which adds the value of `el` to the `tov` set or collection. The initial state indicates that `el` is currently at `el + 1`, which means `el` has been incremented from a previous value. The exact previous value of `el` is not known, but it can be inferred that it's greater than 1 since `n` is greater than 2.

Since `tov` is modified by adding `el`, the output state will reflect this change. The other variables `n` and `arr[el]` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `el` is now at `el + 1; el` has been added to `tov`.**
