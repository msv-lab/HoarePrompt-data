According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element. Given the current state, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is less than `n - 1`, which allows the loop to potentially execute, but we need to ensure that `ds[nxt]` is not empty.

Before the loop starts, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`. This suggests that `ds[nxt]` is populated based on some condition related to `arr`, but we do not know the current contents of `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `ds[nxt]` has at least one element. Therefore, we can state that `ds[nxt]` must be a non-empty list. 

So, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- Ensure `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty list.

Thus, the modified state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty list**.
