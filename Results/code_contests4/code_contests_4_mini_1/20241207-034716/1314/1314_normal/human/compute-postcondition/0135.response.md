`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. The value of `el` has been incremented to `el + 1`, but since the exact values of `cur` and `el` are not provided, we cannot specify their final states. However, the state of `arr` will now have `cur` at the index `el`, which is `el + 1` after increment. The initial conditions for `n` and the requirement for `ds[nxt]` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output reflects the updated state of `arr` with the new value at index `el`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `el` is incremented to `el + 1`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`**
