The variable `nxt` is assigned the value obtained by popping an element from the set `tov`. The value of `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`. The operation of popping an element from a set will remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Since the specific values in `tov` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `nxt`, but we know that it will be one of the elements in the set `tov`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`; `nxt` is an arbitrary element popped from `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`; `nxt` is an arbitrary element popped from `tov`.**
