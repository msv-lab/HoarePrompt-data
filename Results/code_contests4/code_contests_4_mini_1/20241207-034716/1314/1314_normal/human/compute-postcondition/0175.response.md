Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1, `cur` has been increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty list, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 1 more element; `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`; `tov` now includes `el`.**
