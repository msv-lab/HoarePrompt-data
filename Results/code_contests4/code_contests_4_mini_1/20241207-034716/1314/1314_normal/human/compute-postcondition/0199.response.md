Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2 and `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `arr[i]` is equal to 0, `cur` is increased by the number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `nxt` has processed all elements, and `arr` has values updated to `cur` for all indices that were originally 0.***
