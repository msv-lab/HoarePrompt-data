According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the structure of `ds[nxt]` and how many elements it contains. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again if `ds[nxt]` has at least 3 entries. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `el` must point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, so `el` should be updated to the next index in `ds[nxt]`. Therefore, `el` will now refer to the element at index 1 (the second element) in `ds[nxt]` and the loop will execute for this element.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, which will be updated to the next element.**
