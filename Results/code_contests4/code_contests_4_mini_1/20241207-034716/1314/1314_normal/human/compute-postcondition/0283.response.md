In the provided code snippet, `dmain[el].remove(nxt)` is executed. This line attempts to remove the element `nxt` from the list associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. 

The impact of this code on the program is as follows:
- If `nxt` is indeed present in the list `dmain[el]`, it will be removed. 
- If `nxt` is not present in that list, a `ValueError` could potentially occur, but we assume it is handled elsewhere, so we will focus on the expected outcome.

Since the other variables (`i`, `cur`, `tov`, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `sv`, `vis`, and `res`) are not directly affected by this operation, they remain unchanged.

The output state will reflect the unchanged values of all other variables while noting the action taken on the `dmain` dictionary.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` now contains 1 and all unique `el` values added including `el`, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, and now it also contains the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)` if `el` was not previously in `vis`; and we have removed `nxt` from `dmain[el]`.**
