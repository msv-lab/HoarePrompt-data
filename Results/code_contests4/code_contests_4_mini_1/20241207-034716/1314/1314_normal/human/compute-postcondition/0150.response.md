According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. The loop will execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `tov` is a set containing `i`. Since `i` is less than `n - 1` and `n` is greater than 2, `i` must have been chosen such that it is a valid element of the set `tov`. If `tov` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `tov` should contain at least one element, which it does since it currently contains `i`.

No adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one time, as `len(tov)` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is less than `n - 1; `cur` is increased by 1; `tov` is a set containing `i`; `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
