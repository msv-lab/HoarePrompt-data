To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over `dmain[nxt]`. Therefore, the number of iterations is determined by the length of the list `dmain[nxt]`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `n + k`
   - `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`
   - `tov` is empty
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged
   - `sv` now contains the unique value `el`
   - `vis` now contains 1 and all unique `el` values added including `el`
   - `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed
   - The string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)` has been added to `res` if `el` was not previously in `vis`
   - `nxt` has been removed from `dmain[el]`

3. **Analyzing the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be more elements in `dmain[nxt]` that haven't yet been iterated over.
   - Since `n` is greater than 2, it suggests that there are still elements to process, but we need to ensure that `dmain[nxt]` has remaining elements.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The loop variable `el` will take the next value in `dmain[nxt]`. Therefore, if the loop has executed one time already, we need to adjust `el` to the next value in that list.
   - The index `i` would typically increment by 1 for each iteration. 

Given all of this analysis, we conclude the following adjustments for the state:

State: **`i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el` for the next element in `dmain[nxt]`, `vis` remains unchanged, `res` still contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, and now it also contains the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)` if `el` is the next unique value from `dmain[nxt]`.**
