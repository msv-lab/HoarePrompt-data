The value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. The initial state indicates that `tov` already contains the values of `i` and `el`, so after executing the code, `tov` will now include `el` as well. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` now contains at least the values of `i`, `el`, and `el` added, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 1 element; `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.
