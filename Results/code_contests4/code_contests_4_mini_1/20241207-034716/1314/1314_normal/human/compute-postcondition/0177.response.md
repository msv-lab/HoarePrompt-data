According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the list `ds[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty list where `el` is the next element in that list. For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 1 more element, meaning that after the current iteration, we should expect that `el` is updated to the next element in the list. 

Given that `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `cur` has been adjusted based on the count of original zeros in `arr`, we note that `tov` has one less unique element and now includes `el` if `arr[el]` was equal to 0. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
- `el` will be updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, so we need to ensure that `ds[nxt]` has at least one more element.
- `i` may need to be updated if it is being used in conjunction with `el` or the list length.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `el` should be the next element in `ds[nxt]`, which means if `ds[nxt]` initially had `k` elements, it should now have at least `k + 1` elements to allow the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` has been increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` now has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a list of at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 1 more element.**
