The code `vis.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `vis`. The previous value of `vis` is not explicitly defined, but we know it now contains the element `el`. The other variables `i`, `n`, `sv`, and `dmain` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `el` to `vis`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `sv` now contains the element `el`, `vis` now contains the element `el`**
