According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again for that element. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is updated based on elements in `ds[nxt]`, `tov` has one less unique element, and `nxt` is the last element of the original `tov`.

Since `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute, we know that `el` has taken the value of the first element in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `el` must be updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` will be updated to `cur` if it was originally 0, which would also add `el` to `tov` if it was not already present.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows: `el` should become the next element of `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` should still contain at least one more element.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of the original `tov`, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]` for the loop to execute again.**
