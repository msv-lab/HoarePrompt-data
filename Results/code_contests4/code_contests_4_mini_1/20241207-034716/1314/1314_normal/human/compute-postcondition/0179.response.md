The statement `tov.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `tov`. Since `tov` now has one less unique element before this operation, adding `el` will increase the count of unique elements in `tov` back to its previous state or possibly increase it if `el` wasn't already in `tov`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`, `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]`) are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` has been increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` now has one unique element added with `el`, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a list of at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` has been increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` now has one unique element added with `el`, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a list of at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
