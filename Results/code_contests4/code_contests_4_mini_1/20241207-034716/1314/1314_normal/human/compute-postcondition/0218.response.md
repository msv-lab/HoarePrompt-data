The statement `dmain[1].remove(el)` modifies the contents of the list or set stored in `dmain[1]` by removing the element `el`. The values of other variables such as `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `sviaz` remain unchanged. The impact is solely on `dmain[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` is either updated with `arr[el]` or is an empty set, `el` is the second element in `ite`, and the value 1 has been removed from `dmain[el]`.**
