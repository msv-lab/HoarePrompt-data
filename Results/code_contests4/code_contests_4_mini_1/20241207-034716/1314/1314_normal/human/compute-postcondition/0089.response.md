Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections, `arr` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros. If `arr[i]` is 0, then `i` is equal to 2 plus the number of unique elements processed from all iterations, `cur` is set to 1, `tov` is empty, `ds` has at least 3 entries, and `arr` contains 1 at all indices corresponding to elements that were in `ds` and had a value of 0 before the loop execution, while remaining unchanged elsewhere.***
