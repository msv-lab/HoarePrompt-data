The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of `tov.pop()`, which means `nxt` takes on the last element from the list `tov` and `tov` is modified by removing that last element. The previous state indicates that `tov` contains all unique elements from `ds[nxt]` that were previously 0 in `arr`. The specific value of `nxt` will now be the last element of `tov`, and `tov` will have one less element after this operation. The other variables `n`, `i`, `cur`, and `arr` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, and `nxt` is the last element of `tov`.**
