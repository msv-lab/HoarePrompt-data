According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of the `ds[nxt]` collection. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `nxt` is `i`, which means `ds[nxt]` is non-empty. The `cur` variable has been increased by 1 and `tov` now contains `el`, which would be the current element being iterated over in `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element to iterate over. Since `el` is the current element from `ds[nxt]`, we can infer that `el` will be updated to the next element in the next iteration. 

Thus, if `ds[nxt]` has at least two elements, the next value of `el` will be the next index in that collection, and `cur` will be the updated value as per the loop's body logic. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` now contains the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `nxt` is still `i`, and `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 2 elements**.
