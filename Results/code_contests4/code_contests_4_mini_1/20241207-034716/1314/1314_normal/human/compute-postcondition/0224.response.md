Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` remains empty, `n` is greater than 2, and `ite` must have at least one more element to allow another iteration of the loop. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` now includes `arr[el]`. Otherwise, if `arr[el]` is in `sviaz`, then `1` has been removed from `dmain[el]` if it was present.***
