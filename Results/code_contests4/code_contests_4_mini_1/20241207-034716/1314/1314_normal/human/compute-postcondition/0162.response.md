The code `arr[el] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the position indexed by `el` in the array `arr`. The variable `cur` has been increased by 1, so we can use its updated value for the assignment. The variable `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, which is determined by the current index `nxt`, and `nxt` is still `i`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than 2 (but we do not know the exact value),
- `i` is less than `n - 1` (implying there are elements in `ds[nxt]`),
- `cur` has been incremented by 1 (we assume it has a specific value, let's say `cur = x + 1` where `x` is the previous value of `cur`),
- `tov` contains the next element in `ds[nxt]` (but does not affect `arr`),
- `nxt` is still `i`, and `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 3 elements, which means `el` is a valid index.

Therefore, `arr[el]` will be updated with the value of `cur`. The states of `n`, `i`, `tov`, and `ds` do not change with this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1, `cur` is increased by 1, `arr[el]` is assigned the updated value of `cur`.**
