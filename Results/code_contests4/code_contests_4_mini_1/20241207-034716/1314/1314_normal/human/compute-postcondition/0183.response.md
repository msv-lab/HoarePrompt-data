The value of `nxt` is assigned the last element of the list `tov` after popping it from the list. This operation removes that last element from `tov`, and the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of the original `tov`, `ds[nxt]` may still contain processed elements, and `arr` has values updated to `cur` where they were originally 0.
