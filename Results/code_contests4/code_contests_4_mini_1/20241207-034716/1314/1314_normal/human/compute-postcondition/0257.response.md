The variable `sv` is a set that will now include the element `el`. Since `el` is not in `vis`, adding it to `sv` increases the number of unique values in `sv`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now includes `el`, `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values added, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed.
