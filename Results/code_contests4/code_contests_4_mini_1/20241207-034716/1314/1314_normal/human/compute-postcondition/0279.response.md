The operation `sv.add(el)` adds the element `el` to the set `sv`. The initial state indicates that `sv` no longer contains one unique value from `arr` that was encountered, and `el` is not in `vis`. Therefore, after executing `sv.add(el)`, `sv` will now contain that unique value `el`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values added, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, `nxt` is a valid key in `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one element.**
