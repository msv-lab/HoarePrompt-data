According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `dmain[nxt]`. If `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 2, while `cur` reflects the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`. The variable `tov` is empty, and `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values plus the new `el`. The variable `res` contains `['YES']` followed by the new string from `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`, and `dmain[el]` no longer contains `nxt`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `dmain[nxt]` must have at least one more element. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, and `el` will be set to the next element in `dmain[nxt]`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values plus the new `el`, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by the new string from `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`, for the loop to execute a second time `dmain[nxt]` must contain at least one more element.**
