Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged. If `el` is not in `vis`, then `vis` now contains 1 and all unique `el` values plus the new `el`, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by the new string from `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`, and `sv` now contains the element `el`. If `el` was already in `vis`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
