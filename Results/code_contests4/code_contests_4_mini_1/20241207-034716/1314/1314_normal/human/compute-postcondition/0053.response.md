The method `add(el)` is called on the `tov` object, which is expected to add the value of `el` to some collection. The value of `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, but the specific value is not provided. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state indicates that `el` has been added to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `el` has been added to `tov`.**
