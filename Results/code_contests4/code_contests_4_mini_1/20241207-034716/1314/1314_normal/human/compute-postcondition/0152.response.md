According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `nxt`, which is currently set to `i`. The loop will iterate over `ds[nxt]`, so for the loop to execute, `ds` must have an element at index `nxt`. Given that `i` is less than `n - 1`, `nxt` is valid as long as `ds` has enough elements.

To ensure the loop executes, we must confirm that `ds` has at least one element at index `nxt`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nxt` is a valid index in the `ds` list. 

The states can be adjusted to reflect that `ds[nxt]` is non-empty. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1, cur` is increased by 1, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is `i`, for the loop to execute `ds[nxt]` must be non-empty**
