Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged. If `el` is not in `vis`, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` now includes `el`, and `res` now contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed and the string `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`.***
