The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the `tov` set or collection. The operation does not change the values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `cur`, and `arr[el]`). Therefore, the output state remains focused on the unchanged variables and indicates the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1, `cur` is increased by 1, `arr[el]` is assigned the updated value of `cur`, and `el` is added to `tov`.**
