The value of `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is 1. Since `el` is a valid index that points to an entry in the `arr`, the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to 1. The previous state of `arr[el]` was 0, but now it contains 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `ds[nxt]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `cur` is 1, `el` is the next unique element in `ds[nxt]`, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds`, `tov` now includes `el`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 4 entries, and `arr` now contains 1 at index `el`.**
