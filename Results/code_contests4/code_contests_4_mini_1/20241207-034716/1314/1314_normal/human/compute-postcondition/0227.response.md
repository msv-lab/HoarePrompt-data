The value `1` is added to the set `sv`. Since `sv` was initially empty, it now contains the value `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated state of `sv`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged; `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` may have had elements removed based on the intersection with `sviaz`; `sv` contains 1.**
