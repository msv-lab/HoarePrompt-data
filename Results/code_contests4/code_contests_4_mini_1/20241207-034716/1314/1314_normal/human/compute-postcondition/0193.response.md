According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains more elements to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `cur` has been increased based on the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`. 

Since the loop iterates over `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `ds[nxt]` that has not been processed yet. Given that the loop variable `el` is currently referencing one of the elements in `ds[nxt]`, it will move to the next element in the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `el` must be the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `cur` will continue to be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must have at least one more element, and `el` will be the next element in `ds[nxt]`.**
