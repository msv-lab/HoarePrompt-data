The variable `vis` is updated by adding the unique value `el` to it. As `vis` already contains 1 and all unique `el` values added, it will now include `el` if it was not already present. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + k`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sv` now contains the unique value `el`, `vis` now contains 1 and all unique `el` values added including `el`, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by strings for each unique `el` processed, `nxt` is a valid key in `dmain`, `dmain[nxt]` contains at least one element.
