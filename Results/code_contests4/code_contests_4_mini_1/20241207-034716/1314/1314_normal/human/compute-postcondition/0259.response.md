The `res` list is modified by appending a new string, which is created by combining the string representation of the variable `nxt` and the string representation of the variable `el`. The values of both `nxt` and `el` are not provided in the initial state, but they will be added to the existing list `res`. The initial part of `res` contains `['YES']`, so after appending, `res` will have one more element added to it.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `vis` contains 1 and all unique `el` values plus potentially the new `el`, `res` contains `['YES']` followed by the new string from `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`**
