The statement `arr[el] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` in the list `arr`. The previous state indicates that the element `arr[el]` was originally 0. After the assignment, `arr[el]` will no longer be 0 but will now hold the value of `cur`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `tov`, `nxt`, and `ds[nxt]`) remain unchanged as they are not impacted by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds[nxt]` is a non-empty list, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.**
