Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` contains the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `nxt` is still `i`, and `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 2 elements. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `el` is added to `tov`.***
