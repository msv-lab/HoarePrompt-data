The code adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`. Since `tov` already contains at least the values of `i`, `el`, and `el` added, adding `el` again does not change its content if `el` is already present. The values of other variables (`cur`, `n`, `nxt`, `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]`) remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` now contains at least the values of `i`, `el`, and `el` added, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 2 elements, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` (if `arr[el]` was equal to 0), and `el` is added to `tov` (though it may already exist there).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `tov` now contains at least the values of `i`, `el`, and `el` added, `nxt` is an arbitrary element from `tov`, `el` is updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`, `ds[nxt]` must still contain at least 2 elements, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` (if `arr[el]` was equal to 0), and `el` is added to `tov`.**
