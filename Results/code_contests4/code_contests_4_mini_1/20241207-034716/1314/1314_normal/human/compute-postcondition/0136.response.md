The method `add` is called on `tov`, which adds the current value of `el` to the collection it represents. The previous value of `el` has been incremented by 1, but its specific value is unknown. The variable `n` is greater than 2, but it does not affect the operation of `tov.add(el)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `el` has been incremented to `el + 1`, and `tov` now contains the value `el`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `el` has been incremented to `el + 1`, and `tov` now contains the value `el`**
