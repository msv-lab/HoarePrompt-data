Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2))), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds` is a defaultdict of sets containing pairs of integers from input excluding 1, `dmain` is a defaultdict of sets containing all pairs of integers from input, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, and the length of `dmain[1]` is less than `D`; 'NO' is printed.**
