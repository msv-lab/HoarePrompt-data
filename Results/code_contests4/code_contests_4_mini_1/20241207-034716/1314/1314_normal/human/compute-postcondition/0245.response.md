The code `dmain[el].remove(nxt)` will attempt to remove `nxt` from the list associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. The initial state indicates that `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, which suggests that `nxt` is either already absent from `dmain[el]` or this operation will successfully remove it. 

Since `dmain[el]` is already stated to have `nxt` removed, the operation has no effect on `dmain[el]`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, `sviaz` contains all unique values from `arr` that were encountered, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed (remains unchanged), `sv` now contains `el` and possibly other unique values, `vis` contains 1 and `el`, and now also contains `el`, `res` is `['YES', str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el), str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)]`.**
