The statement `arr[el] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the index `el` in the array `arr`. Given that `cur` is 1, the element at index `el` in `arr` will now be updated from its previous value of 0 to 1. The other variables `n`, `i`, `tov`, `ds`, and `nxt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is a valid index for `ds` with at least one element in `ds[nxt]`, `tov` has one less unique element, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `arr` contains 1 at index `el` and unchanged elsewhere.**
