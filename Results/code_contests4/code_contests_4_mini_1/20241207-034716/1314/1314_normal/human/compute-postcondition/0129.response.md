According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. The loop will only execute if `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element, as it is iterating over that collection. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 2, which does not affect the loop's execution directly. The variable `cur` is incremented based on the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, but this does not determine the execution of the loop either. The crucial point is the state of `ds[nxt]`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element. Additionally, the variable `el` will represent the first element in the iteration over `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, `tov` now has one less element, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to all elements that were previously 0 from `ds[nxt]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, and `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`**
