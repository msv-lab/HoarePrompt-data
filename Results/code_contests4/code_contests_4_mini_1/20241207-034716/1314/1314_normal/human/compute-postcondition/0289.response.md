The statement `dmain[el].remove(nxt)` attempts to remove the value `nxt` from the list associated with the key `el` in the dictionary `dmain`. However, this code does not alter the values of `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, or `vis`. Since `dmain` remains unchanged and the other variables retain their previous states, the output state reflects that no values have been returned or modified except for the action of removing `nxt` from `dmain[el]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, and `dmain` remain unchanged, and `nxt` has been removed from `dmain[el]`.**
