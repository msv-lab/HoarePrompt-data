The values of `s` and `f` are assigned from the input, which are integers. The previous state indicates that `s` is an input integer not equal to 1, and `f` is also an input integer not equal to 1. The values of `s` and `f` will now be updated to the integers provided via input.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m and m > 2), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds[f]` contains `s`, `i` is 2, `s` is now an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is now an input integer not equal to 1; `dmain[f]` now includes `s`, and `f` is added to `dmain[s]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m and m > 2), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds[f]` contains `s`, `i` is 2, `s` is now an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is now an input integer not equal to 1; `dmain[f]` now includes `s`, and `f` is added to `dmain[s]`.**
