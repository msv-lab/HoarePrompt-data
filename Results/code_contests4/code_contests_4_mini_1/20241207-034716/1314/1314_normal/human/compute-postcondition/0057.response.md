The variable `nxt` is assigned the value of the last element popped from the list `tov`. The previous state of `tov` contains elements from `ds[nxt]` that were not already in `arr`, and since `tov` has at least one entry, `nxt` will now reflect the value of that last element. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `cur`, `ds`, and `arr`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one less element, and `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is the last element of `tov`, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` has one less element, and `arr` remains unchanged.**
