Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the number of elements assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` now contains `el`, `nxt` is the last element that was in `tov`, and `arr` contains values assigned to elements that were previously 0. If `arr[el]` is 0, then `ds[nxt]` is still a valid key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.***
