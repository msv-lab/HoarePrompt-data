`arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and since `i` is 2 and `cur` is 1, `arr[2]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections, `arr` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and `tov` is {2}.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, and `i` are integers and collections, `arr` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `arr[2]` which is now 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, and `tov` is {2}.**
