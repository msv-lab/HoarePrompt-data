According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `dmain[nxt]`. The loop will execute one more time for each element in `dmain[nxt]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + k + 1`, `cur` is equal to the total number of unique elements in `ds` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` is empty, `n` is greater than 2, and `nxt` has been removed from `dmain[el]`.

To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more element in `dmain[nxt]`. Therefore, I need to adjust the state such that `el` corresponds to the next element in `dmain[nxt]`. If the current iteration is the last one that was executed, it follows that `el` needs to be set to the next available element in `dmain[nxt]` after the last processed one.

Assuming that there was at least one element processed in the last iteration, we can denote the next available element as the next item in the sequence of elements in `dmain[nxt]`. Thus, `el` will point to this next element, and `i` will be incremented as the loop executes one additional time.

State: **`i` is `n + k + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `dmain[nxt]` must have at least one more element that can be assigned to `el`.**
