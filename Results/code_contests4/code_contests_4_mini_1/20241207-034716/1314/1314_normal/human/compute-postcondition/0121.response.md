Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the number of elements assigned from `arr` to `cur`, `tov` contains `el` and now includes the added element, `nxt` is the last element that was in `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to elements that were previously 0. If `arr[el]` was 0, then `arr[el]` is now assigned the value of `cur`.***
