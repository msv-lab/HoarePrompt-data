The statement `arr[i] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the index `i` of the array `arr`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `cur` is incremented by 1, and `tov` contains the current value of `i`. However, the specific values of `cur` and `i` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the effect without exact numerical output.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`; `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
