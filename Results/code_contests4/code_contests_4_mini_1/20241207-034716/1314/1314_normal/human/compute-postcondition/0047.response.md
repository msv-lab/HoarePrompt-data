According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ds[nxt]`. Since `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element and `i` is currently 2, we need to check the state for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, and `ds[nxt]` has at least one element, which means the loop has executed for the first element of `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to increment `el` to point to the next element in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` has more than one element, `el` will take the next value in the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, for the loop to execute a second time `ds[nxt]` must have at least 2 elements, and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`**
