The code `tov.add(el)` adds the value of `el` to the set `tov`, which results in potentially changing the number of unique elements in `tov`. The previous state indicates that `tov` had one less unique element before this operation. The value of `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `cur`, `nxt`, and `arr[el]`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is increased by the number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that were originally 0 in `arr`, `tov` has one less unique element before this operation, `nxt` is the last element of the original `tov`, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `tov` now has one more unique element.**
