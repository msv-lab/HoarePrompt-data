The code appends a string to the list `res`, which consists of the string representation of the variable `nxt` followed by a space and the string representation of the variable `el`. The initial values of `nxt` and `el` are not provided, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, `i`, `sv`, and `vis` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n + k + 2`, `sv` now contains `el`, `vis` now includes `el`, `res` is updated with the string representation of `nxt` followed by a space and the string representation of `el`.**
