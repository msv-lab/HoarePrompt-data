According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. The loop will execute as long as `len(tov)` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`. For the loop to execute the first time, `tov` must not be empty. This means that `i` needs to have been added to `tov` before entering the loop. Since `tov` is currently a set with the value of `i`, it implies that there is at least one element in it.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for `cur`, `n`, or `arr[i]` since the state of `tov` already allows the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the current value of `i`**
