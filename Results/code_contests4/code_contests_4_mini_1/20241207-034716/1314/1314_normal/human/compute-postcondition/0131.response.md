The variable `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. Since `cur` is a variable that was previously incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, `arr[el]` will now hold the updated value of `cur`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, `tov` now has one less element, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to all elements that were previously 0 from `ds[nxt]`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.**
