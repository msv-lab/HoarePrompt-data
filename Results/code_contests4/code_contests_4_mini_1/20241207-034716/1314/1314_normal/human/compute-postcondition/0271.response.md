The code appends a string to the list `res` that combines the string representation of `nxt` and `el` with a space in between. The values of `nxt` and `el` need to be evaluated based on the current state of the program.

Since `i` is given as `n + 2`, but we do not have the specific value of `n`, and `sv` and `vis` are both containing the element `el`, the output will reflect the addition to the `res` list. The other variables (`i`, `sv`, `vis`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 2`, `sv` contains `el`, `vis` contains `el`, and `res` now has an additional string element formed by `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `sv` contains `el`, `vis` contains `el`, and `res` now has an additional string element formed by `str(nxt) + ' ' + str(el)`**.
