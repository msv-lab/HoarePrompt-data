According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `tov` has a length greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(tov)` is greater than 0, as indicated by the current state where `tov` contains all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were not already in `arr`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states as the loop can still execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `nxt` is 2, `ds` has at least 3 entries, `tov` contains all elements from `ds[nxt]` that were not already in `arr`, and `arr` has been updated with the value of `cur` for each element of `ds[nxt]` that was 0, now reflecting their respective indices with the value 1**.
