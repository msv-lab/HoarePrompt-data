Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, `tov` now includes `el`, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to all elements that were previously 0 from `ds[nxt]`, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.***
