According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the structure of `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `el` has been incremented to `el + 1`, meaning `el` is now one past the last valid index. Since `n` is greater than 2, `el` must be less than the length of `ds[nxt]` for the loop to execute one more time.

For the loop to execute one more time, `el` must be incremented to `el + 1`, which means after this iteration, `el` needs to be at least the current index plus one. This means `el` will be incremented again, and for the loop to continue, `el` must be less than the length of `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `el` is now at `el + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `el` must be less than the length of `ds[nxt]`.**
