Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `m` is an integer (n - 1 ≤ m and m > 2), `D` is an integer (1 ≤ D < n), `ds[f]` contains `s`, `i` is 2, `s` is now an input integer not equal to 1, `f` is now an input integer not equal to 1; `dmain[f]` now includes `s`, `f` is added to `dmain[s]`, and `f` is added to the set `ds[s]`.**
