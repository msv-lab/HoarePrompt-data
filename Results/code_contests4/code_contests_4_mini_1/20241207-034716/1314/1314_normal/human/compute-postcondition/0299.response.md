The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within the constraints provided for `n`, `m`, `D`, and the edges described as pairs of integers. The function processes this input data and returns a result based on the relationships and conditions established by these parameters. 

Since the exact output behavior is not specified in the provided details, I will describe the general functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and processes data related to integers n, m, D, and edges to produce a result based on the given constraints and relationships.**
