The `tov` set is updated to include the element `el`, which is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. This operation does not change any other variables. Therefore, the Output State reflects the addition of `el` to `tov`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `cur` is incremented by the total number of elements in `ds[nxt]` that had `arr[el]` equal to 0, `tov` now includes `el`, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `arr` contains values assigned to all elements that were previously 0 from `ds[nxt]`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.**
