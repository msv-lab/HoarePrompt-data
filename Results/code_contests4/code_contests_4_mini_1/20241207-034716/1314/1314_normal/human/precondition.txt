n is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), m is an integer representing the number of edges (n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(200,000, (n(n-1))/(2))), and D is a positive integer representing the required degree of the first vertex (1 ≤ D < n). The edges are pairs of integers (v_i, u_i) where 1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n and v_i ≠ u_i, indicating connections between vertices without self-loops or multiple edges.
