To determine the correctness of the annotated program in relation to the provided problem description, let's analyze the program step by step in the context of the requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and the required degree `D`. It constructs two dictionaries:
   - `ds`: This stores edges excluding the edges connected to vertex 1.
   - `dmain`: This stores all edges of the graph.

2. **Degree Check**: The program checks if the degree of vertex 1 (i.e., the number of edges connected to vertex 1) is less than `D`. If it is, the program prints "NO" and exits. This is correct as it adheres to the requirement of having the degree of vertex 1 equal to `D`.

3. **Connected Components**: The program performs a traversal to identify connected components of the graph that do not include vertex 1 and counts them. It uses an array `arr` to track which component each vertex belongs to. If the number of unique components `cur` exceeds `D`, it prints "NO" and exits. This is also correct because it ensures that the condition for forming a spanning tree with the required degree is maintained.

4. **Building the Spanning Tree**:
   - The program constructs a set `sviaz` to keep track of unique components encountered while iterating through the edges connected to vertex 1.
   - It attempts to establish connections while ensuring that no more than `D` edges are connected to vertex 1, thus fulfilling the requirement for the degree of vertex 1.
   - Finally, it constructs the result list `res` which stores the edges of the spanning tree and prints "YES" followed by the edges.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly checks the degree condition for vertex 1.
- It ensures that no more than `D` edges connect to vertex 1.
- It adequately constructs a spanning tree from the graph edges while adhering to the degree requirement.

Based on this analysis, the program does meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, as it includes all necessary checks and constructs a valid output accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
