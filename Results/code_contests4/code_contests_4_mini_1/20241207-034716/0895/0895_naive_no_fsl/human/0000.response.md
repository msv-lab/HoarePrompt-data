To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and identify any potential issues.

### Program Analysis
1. The program reads two time inputs in the format `hh:mm` using `raw_input()`.
2. It converts the first time input into total minutes (`c`) and adds the total minutes from the second time input.
3. It calculates the average of the total minutes by dividing by 2.
4. The resulting average in minutes is then converted back into hours and minutes using `divmod`.
5. Finally, it formats both the hours and minutes to ensure they are two digits and prints them.

### Problem Description Requirements
- The program must calculate the midpoint of a time range (from `h_1:m_1` to `h_2:m_2`).
- The output must be in the format `hh:mm`, where both components are two digits.

### Key Points of Consideration
- The code does not explicitly handle the output of the midpoint. After calculating `c`, it should convert the result back into hours and minutes and print them correctly.
- The code uses `raw_input()`, which is not applicable in Python 3; it should use `input()` instead.
- The program does not actually print the midpoint, as there is no `print` statement for the final result.

### Missing Logic
- The program should output the calculated time in the format `hh:mm`. Since it lacks the print statement for the final result, it does not meet the output requirement specified in the problem description.

### Test Cases for Validation
- For an input of `10:00` and `11:00`, the program should output `10:30`.
- For an input of `11:10` and `11:12`, the program should output `11:11`.
- For an input of `01:02` and `03:02`, the program should output `02:02`.

However, since the program does not print anything, it fails to meet the output requirement, making it incorrect.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not function as described in the problem statement because it does not produce an output, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it fails to output the midpoint time, which is a requirement explicitly stated in the problem description.
