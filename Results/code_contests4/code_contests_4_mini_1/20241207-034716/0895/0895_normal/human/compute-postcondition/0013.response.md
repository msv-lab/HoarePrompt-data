Functionality: ** The function accepts two pairs of time inputs in the format "h:m" (representing the start and end times of a contest) and calculates the average time by halving the total minutes between the two times. It ensures that both the hour and minute components of the average time are formatted as two-digit strings. The function does not return any value or output, so the results are not directly accessible to the caller; it processes the input but lacks a return statement or output mechanism. **
