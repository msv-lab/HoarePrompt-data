The code assigns `d` the result of `map(str, divmod(c, 60))`. The `divmod` function takes `c` and divides it by 60, returning a tuple that contains the quotient and the remainder. The `map` function then converts each element of that tuple to a string.

Since `c` is decreased to half of its previous value, let's denote the initial value of `c` as `c_initial`. After halving, `c` becomes `c = c_initial / 2`. The `divmod(c, 60)` will yield a quotient and a remainder based on the new value of `c`.

The output state reflects the values of `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` (which remain integers and are unaffected by the code), and the resulting string representation of the quotient and remainder from `divmod(c, 60)`.

Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers; `d` holds string representations of the quotient and remainder from dividing `c` (halved) by 60.**
