The value of `d[1]` is modified by concatenating '0' to its current value. Since `d[1]` is a one-character string, the new value of `d[1]` will be '0' followed by the previous character of `d[1]`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers; `d` holds string representations of the quotient and remainder from dividing `c` (halved) by 60; the length of the second element of `d` is equal to 1, and `d[1]` is now '0' + previous value of `d[1]`.
