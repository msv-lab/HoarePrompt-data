The variable `c` is assigned the value `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`, which calculates the total number of minutes by converting the hours (`a[0]`) into minutes and adding the minutes (`a[1]`). The values of `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are not affected by this calculation, as they are separate integer variables. Therefore, based on the input values of `a`, we can conclude that `c` will be an integer representing the total minutes calculated from `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers; `c` is calculated as `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`**.
