The variable `a` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split(':'))`, which takes a string input formatted as "h:m", splits it by the colon, and converts each part into an integer. Since `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are not directly modified by this line of code, they remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables and indicate that `a` now holds a map object containing the integer representations of the split input.

Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59; `a` is a map object containing the integer representations of the split input.**
