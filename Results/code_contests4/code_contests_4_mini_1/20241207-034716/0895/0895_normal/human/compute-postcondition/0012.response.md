The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it works with the following input values: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2`, which are integers constrained by 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59. Additionally, the contest lasts an even number of minutes, satisfying the condition m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2, and the duration of the contest is at least two minutes. However, since the function itself does not take parameters and is not described in terms of return values, we can summarize the functionality as follows.

Functionality: **The function operates on the conditions of the contest start and end time, ensuring the contest lasts an even number of minutes and at least two minutes. It returns information or results based on these internal conditions.**
