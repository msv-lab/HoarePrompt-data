The variable `a` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split(':'))`, which reads a string input, splits it by the colon `:`, and converts each part to an integer. The values of `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are not directly affected by this operation, but `a` will contain two integers representing hours and minutes. Therefore, the output state indicates that `a` is now a list of two integers.

Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers; `a` is a list of two integers from input**
