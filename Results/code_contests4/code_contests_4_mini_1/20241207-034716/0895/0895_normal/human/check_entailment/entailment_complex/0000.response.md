Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` and `map()`, which are not correctly handling the inputs as expected. The `map()` function returns a map object in Python 3, and the program does not convert this to a list. As a result, `a[0]` and `a[1]` will raise an error since `a` is not a list.

2. **Calculation of Midpoint**: The program computes the total minutes from two times but fails to correctly calculate the midpoint. The midpoint should be calculated from the start and end times directly, not by simply averaging the total minutes. The current implementation sums both times and divides by 2, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Output Mechanism**: The function processes input but does not print or return the calculated midpoint. The problem description specifies that the output must be in the format `hh:mm`, but the function lacks any output statements to display this result.

4. **Time Formatting**: Although the program attempts to ensure that both hours and minutes are formatted as two-digit strings, it does so incorrectly due to the issues with input handling and calculation.

For example, if we consider the input `10:00` and `11:00`, the expected output is `10:30`. However, the current implementation will not work as intended due to the aforementioned reasons, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect outputs.

In conclusion, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description as it does not correctly handle the input, perform the necessary calculation, or output the result in the required format.
