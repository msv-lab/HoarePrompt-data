To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the functionality of the program and compare it to the requirements.

The problem description states that Polycarp wants to find the midpoint of a contest that starts at `h_1:m_1` and ends at `h_2:m_2`. 

### Program Breakdown:
1. The program reads two time inputs in the format `hh:mm`, using `raw_input()` to read the times.
2. It converts the first time into total minutes from the start of the day, storing it in variable `c`.
3. It then reads the second time and adds its total minutes to `c`.
4. The program calculates the average (midpoint) by dividing `c` by 2.
5. It uses `divmod` to convert the total midpoint minutes back into hours and minutes.
6. Finally, it formats the output to ensure hours and minutes are two digits.

### Potential Issue:
While the program seems to handle the midpoint calculation, there are a couple of key concerns:
- The variable `c` is being used to accumulate the total minutes of both times and then halved, which implies that it is calculating the average of the total minutes from the start of the day. However, this does not directly give the midpoint of the two specified times.
  
- Specifically, if we consider the input `10:00` and `11:00`, the program would compute:
  - Total minutes for `10:00` = `10 * 60 + 0 = 600`
  - Total minutes for `11:00` = `11 * 60 + 0 = 660`
  - The total becomes `600 + 660 = 1260`, and dividing by 2 gives `630`, which corresponds to `10:30`. This works correctly for this case.
  
- However, for the input `11:10` and `11:12`, it would compute:
  - Total minutes for `11:10` = `11 * 60 + 10 = 670`
  - Total minutes for `11:12` = `11 * 60 + 12 = 672`
  - The total becomes `670 + 672 = 1342`, and dividing by 2 gives `671`, which corresponds to `11:11`. This also works correctly for this case.

However, the problem with the logic arises because the program does not handle the case where the computation of minutes results in an average that may not correspond directly to the midpoint of the two times if the times are not evenly spaced around a midpoint (though the problem guarantees they will be). 

For example, if we had an edge case where `h_1:m_1` and `h_2:m_2` were such that the total of their minutes when divided does not yield a proper even distribution (if we were to consider cases outside the provided constraints), the program might fail. 

### Conclusion:
Since the core logic regarding the calculation of the midpoint seems sound for the provided inputs, but the program is not explicitly safeguarded against all potential interpretations of the midpoint under various scenarios (especially with regards to even distribution of minutes across a broader range), we can conclude that the program does not strictly adhere to the problem's constraints in every conceivable case.

Therefore, since the program fails to account correctly for potential edge cases, the overall correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.
