The variable `l` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will take an input from the user. However, since the initial state specifies that `l` is an integer representing the length of the corridor, the output state will reflect that `l` is now an integer input from the user. The values of `p` and `q` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer input from the user, `p` is an integer representing the speed of Harry's spell, `q` is an integer representing the speed of You-Know-Who's spell.**
