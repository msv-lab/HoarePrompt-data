The code attempts to perform a division of the float value of `l` by the concatenation of `p` and `q`, and then multiplies the result by `p`. However, since `p` and `q` are strings, their concatenation will result in another string, which will cause a TypeError when attempting to perform the division with a float. The output state reflects that the operation results in an error.

Output State: **TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'float' and 'str'**
