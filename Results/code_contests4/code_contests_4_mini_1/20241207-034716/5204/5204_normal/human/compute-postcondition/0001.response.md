The variable `p` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input from the user. Since `p` is expected to be an integer representing the speed of Harry's spell, the type of `p` will now be a string after the input. The values of `l` and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a string input, `q` is an integer representing the speed of You-Know-Who's spell.

Output State: **`l` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a string input, `q` is an integer representing the speed of You-Know-Who's spell.**
