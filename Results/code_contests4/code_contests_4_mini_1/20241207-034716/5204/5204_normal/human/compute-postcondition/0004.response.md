The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it relies on predefined variable values for `l`, `p`, and `q`. These variables represent the following:

- `l` is an integer that indicates the length of the corridor (1 ≤ l ≤ 1000).
- `p` is an integer that indicates the speed of Harry's spell (1 ≤ p ≤ 500).
- `q` is an integer that indicates the speed of You-Know-Who's spell (1 ≤ q ≤ 500).

The function evaluates the conditions based on these parameters and produces outputs based on the relationship between the speeds and the length of the corridor. 

Since the exact outputs based on these parameters are not provided in the prompt, we cannot detail specific return values. However, we can outline the general functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters representing the length of the corridor (l), speed of Harry's spell (p), and speed of You-Know-Who's spell (q), and determines the outcome based on the comparison of spell speeds relative to the corridor length.**
