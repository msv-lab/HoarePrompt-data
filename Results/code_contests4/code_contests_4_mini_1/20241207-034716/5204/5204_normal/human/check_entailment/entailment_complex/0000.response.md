Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the key points of failure:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads inputs using `input()` but does not convert them to integers before performing calculations. This could lead to errors or incorrect results if the inputs are not in the expected format.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The calculation `print(float(l) / (p + q)) * p` attempts to compute the distance from Harry to the place of the second meeting of the spells, but it does so incorrectly:
   - It first calculates the time it takes for the spells to meet for the first time by dividing the length of the corridor `l` by the sum of their speeds `p + q`. This gives the time until collision, but the next step is incorrect.
   - Then, it multiplies the time by `p`, which is intended to compute the distance Harry's spell travels. However, this does not account for the fact that the spells will meet, collide, and reflect back, and then meet again. The second meeting point needs to consider the total distance each spell covers until they collide again.

3. **Lack of Return Statement**: The function does not return the result; it only prints it. The problem statement requires the output to be a specific real number representing the distance, not merely printing it.

4. **Output Format**: The output must be a single real number with a precision that meets the specified error limits. The implementation does not ensure that the output follows this format.

Overall, the program fails to implement the logic needed to determine the distance correctly according to the problem description. Thus, it is incorrect.
