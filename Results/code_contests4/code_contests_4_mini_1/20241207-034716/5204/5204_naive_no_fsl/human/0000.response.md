To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to check if it correctly calculates the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses.

### Breakdown of the Problem:

1. **Inputs**:
   - Length of the corridor `l`.
   - Speed of Harry's spell `p`.
   - Speed of You-Know-Who's spell `q`.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - The distance from Harry's position to the second collision point of the spells.

3. **Logic**:
   - When both spells are cast simultaneously, they travel towards each other.
   - The time until the first collision can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{time} = \frac{l}{p + q}
     \]
   - The distance traveled by Harry's spell until the first collision is:
     \[
     \text{distance} = p \times \text{time} = \frac{p \times l}{p + q}
     \]
   - After the first collision, the spells return to their casters and are immediately cast again. The second collision will occur at the same distance from Harry's position.

### Evaluation of the Provided Program:

The program reads inputs for `l`, `p`, and `q` and computes:
```python
print(float(l) / (p + q)) * p
```

This line is equivalent to:
\[
\frac{l \times p}{p + q}
\]
which correctly represents the distance from Harry's position to the first collision point.

Since the distance to the second collision point is the same as the first, the program outputs the correct result.

### Checking Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum values**: 
   - For `l = 1, p = 1, q = 1`: The expected output is `0.5`, and the program calculates it correctly.
   
2. **Equal speeds**: 
   - For `l = 100, p = 50, q = 50`: The expected output is `50`, and the program calculates it correctly.

3. **Different speeds**: 
   - For `l = 199, p = 60, q = 40`: The expected output is `119.4`, and the program calculates it correctly.

4. **Edge speed values**: 
   - For `l = 1000, p = 500, q = 500`: The expected output is `500`, and the program calculates it correctly.

### Conclusion:

After evaluating the program against the problem description and considering various edge cases, it appears to function correctly without any identified flaws.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program accurately computes the required distance for all tested cases, adhering to the problem description.
