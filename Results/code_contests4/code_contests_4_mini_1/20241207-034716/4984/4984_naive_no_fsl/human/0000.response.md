Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that can lead to incorrect results. One specific case where it fails to adhere to the problem description is when `p=1` and `x=3`. 

In this scenario, the function `func_1` checks single-digit numbers (1 through 9) to see if moving the last digit to the front results in a number that is `x` times the original. Since all single-digit numbers remain the same when their last digit is moved to the front, none of them will satisfy the condition of growing by any factor `x` greater than 1. The program would return "Impossible" as expected, but it fails to correctly handle and return "Impossible" when `x` is a number like 3.

Moreover, the logic in `func_2` that checks for `x == 5` and `p % 42 == 0` is a hardcoded check that may not cover all cases appropriately. The potential for miscalculating the suitable number when `p` is not a multiple of `l` (the length of the found number) also leads to incorrect outputs.

Thus, there exists at least one input case where the program does not work as required, which confirms that the implementation is incorrect.
