The function accepts a positive integer `p` and an integer `x` (between 1 and 9 inclusive). If `x` is 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, it returns the result of `func_1(42, 5)` multiplied by `(p / 42)`. If these conditions are not met, it iterates from 1 to 999, calling `func_1(i, x)` and checking if the result is non-empty. If the length of the result divides `p`, it outputs the result repeated `(p / l)` times. If not, it outputs 'Impossible'. If no suitable result is found after the loop, the function does not return anything, effectively ending without output.
