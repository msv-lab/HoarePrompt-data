Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `p` is equal to 1. According to the problem description, it states that if the number consists of a single digit, it cannot stay what it is when multiplied by any number greater than 1 (in this case, `x` can be between 1 and 9). However, the code does not explicitly check for the case where `p = 1` and `x > 1`, which should return "Impossible". 

The annotations mention that the function will return an empty string if no valid number can be formed, but it does not account for situations where `p` is 1 and `x` is greater than 1, which should also lead to an "Impossible" output. 

For example, if we input `1 2`, the expected output is "Impossible", but the code does not handle this case correctly. As a result, there are potential inputs for which the program does not provide the correct output as specified in the problem description. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
