The value of `b` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. Therefore, `b` is now 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a list containing one string of `p` ones and one additional string from `a`, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, and `a` is now reversed if `b` equals `i` and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a list containing one string of `p` ones and one additional string from `a`, `i` is 3, `s` is 0, `b` is 3, and `a` is now reversed if `b` equals `i` and `s` is 0.**
