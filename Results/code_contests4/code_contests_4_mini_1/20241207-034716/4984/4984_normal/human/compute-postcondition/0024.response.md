The code appends the value of `b` to the list `a`. The current value of `b` is 2, and since `a` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `a` will contain the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a list containing one string of `p` ones, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `b` is 2, `a` is a list containing the value 2, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a list containing one string of `p` ones, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `b` is 2, `a` is a list containing the value 2, `j` is 0**
