The value of `a` is modified by appending the value of `b` to it. However, the initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified. The previous values of `p` and `j` do not affect the operation of appending to `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a positive integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `a` has one new value appended to it (the value of `b`).

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `a` has one new value appended to it (the value of `b`).**
