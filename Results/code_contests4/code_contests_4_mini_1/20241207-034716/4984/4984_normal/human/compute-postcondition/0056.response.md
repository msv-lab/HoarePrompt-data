The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order. The previous values of `c` are not altered directly by this operation; however, the order of the elements in `c` will change based on the sorting. Since `c` contains strings formed by repeating digits from 1 to 9, the sorting will rearrange these strings according to their lexicographical order. The values of `p` and `x` remain unchanged as sorting does not impact them.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a sorted list of strings formed by repeating digits from 1 to 9.**
