According to the code, the loop executes as long as the variable `i` is within the range specified, which is from 1 to 999 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 3. 

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 1000. Since `i` is now 3, the loop can execute again.

State: **`s` is assigned the result of `func_1(2, x)`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be less than 1000**
