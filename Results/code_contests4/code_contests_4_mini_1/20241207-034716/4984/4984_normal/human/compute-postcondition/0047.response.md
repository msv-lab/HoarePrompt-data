According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `p`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `p` is a positive integer greater than 1, this means that the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `p`. Since `p` is greater than 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

State: **`p` is a positive integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must be greater than 2**
