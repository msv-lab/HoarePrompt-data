The code writes 'Impossible' to the standard output. The values of the variables do not change, and there are no return statements or calculations that affect the previous variable states. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, `l` is 0, and `l` is not equal to 0 (implying that `p` is not divisible by `l`), and the output is 'Impossible'.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, `l` is 0, and `l` is not equal to 0 (implying that `p` is not divisible by `l`); output is 'Impossible'.**
