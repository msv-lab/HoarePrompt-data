The code snippet `s, b = divmod(b * x + s, 10)` uses the `divmod` function to calculate the quotient and remainder of the expression `b * x + s` when divided by 10. The values of `s` and `b` will be updated based on this calculation.

Since `b` is multiplied by `x` and added to `s`, the values of `s` and `b` will change, but the new values cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `b`, `x`, and `s`. However, since `p` and `j` are not modified by this code, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `s` and `b` after the operation, but we can't specify their exact values. The output state is expressed in general terms.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer greater than 1, `j` is 1; `a` is modified by appending `b` to it; `s` and `b` have been updated by the calculation of divmod(b * x + s, 10).**
