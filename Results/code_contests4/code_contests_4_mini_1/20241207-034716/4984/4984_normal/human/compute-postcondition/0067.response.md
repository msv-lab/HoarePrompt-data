Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a sorted list of strings formed by repeating digits from 1 to 9, and `r` is the first element in `c` that does not start with the character '0'. If all elements in `c` start with '0', the loop will not find a valid `r` and will not return anything.**
