Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `p` (a positive integer representing the length of a number in decimal digits) and `x` (a positive integer between 1 and 9). It generates and returns the smallest valid number of length `p` composed of digits from 1 to 9, where the last digit matches the first digit, and the sum of digits does not create a carry. If no valid number can be formed, it returns an empty string. **
