In this case, the function `func_1(i, x)` is being executed with `i` having the value 2. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, which means we cannot determine the exact output of `func_1` without knowing the behavior or implementation of that function.

Since `i` is 2 and `x` is unknown, it will be necessary to note that `s` will be assigned the result of `func_1` with the current values of `i` and `x`. The state of `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `s` is assigned the result of `func_1(2, x)` where `x` is unknown.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is assigned the result of `func_1(2, x)` where `x` is unknown.**
