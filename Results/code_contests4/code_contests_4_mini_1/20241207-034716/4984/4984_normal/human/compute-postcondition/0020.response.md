In the given code, `s` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(i, x)`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 3, and `x` is some variable whose value is not provided. The function `func_1` is invoked with the parameters `i` (which is 3) and `x`. The output state will include the current assignment to `s`, but since the function's behavior is not defined, we cannot specify the exact value of `s`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is assigned the result of `func_1(3, x)`. 

Output State: **`s` is assigned the result of `func_1(3, x)`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be less than 1000**.
