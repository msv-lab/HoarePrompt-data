Postcondition: ***`p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, `c` is a sorted list of strings formed by repeating digits from 1 to 9 with at least 2 elements, `r` is the second element in `c`, and the first character of `r` is '0'. If the first character of `r` is not '0', the function returns `r`. However, since the precondition states that the first character of `r` is '0', this condition will never be true, and the function will not return anything.***
