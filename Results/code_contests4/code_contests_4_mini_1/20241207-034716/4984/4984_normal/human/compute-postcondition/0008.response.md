The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, and `s` is falsy (not true), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, and `s` is falsy (not true), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
