Postcondition: ***`p` and `x` are positive integers, `c` is a sorted list of strings formed by repeating digits from 1 to 9 with at least 3 elements, `r` is the third element in `c` and starts with the character '0'. Since the first character of `r` is '0', the program returns the third element of the sorted list `c`, which is a string that starts with '0'.***
