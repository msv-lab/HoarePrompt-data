According to the code, the loop iterates through a range from 1 to 999 (inclusive), and proceeds based on the value of `i`. Since the program raised a division by zero error due to 'p' being divisible by 'l', this indicates that 'l' is 0 when the loop attempts to execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has not completed successfully, and `i` is still at its last value, which is 1 (the starting point of the range). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. 

However, the division by zero error is related to the variable 'l', which needs to be modified to ensure it is not 0 in order for the loop to execute without error. 

State: **`i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time 'l' must not be 0**
