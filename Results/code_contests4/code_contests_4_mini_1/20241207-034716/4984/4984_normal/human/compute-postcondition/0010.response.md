The value of `l` is assigned the length of `s`. Since `s` is mentioned to be falsy, its length would be 0. The other variables (`p`, `x`, and `i`) are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, and `l` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `i` is 1, `l` is 0**
