The variables `p` and `x` are both assigned values from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The function `map(int, raw_input().split())` reads the input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer before assigning them to `p` and `x`. The previous values of `p` and `x` are not specified, so they are replaced by the new input values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer representing the length of the decimal number, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and both variables are assigned new input values.

Output State: **`p` is a positive integer representing the length of the decimal number, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and both variables are assigned new input values.**
