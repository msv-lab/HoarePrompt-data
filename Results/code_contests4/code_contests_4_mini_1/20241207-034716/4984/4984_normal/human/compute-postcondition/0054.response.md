Postcondition: ***`p` is a positive integer, `a` is the reversed list of `b` values from each iteration, `s` is the final updated value after all iterations, `b` is the final updated value after all iterations. If `b` equals `i` and `s` equals 0, then `c` is updated to include the string formed by joining the elements of `a`.***
