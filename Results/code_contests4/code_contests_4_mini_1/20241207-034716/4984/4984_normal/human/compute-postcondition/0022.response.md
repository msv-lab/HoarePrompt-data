The function `func_2` accepts parameters `p` and `x`. `p` is a positive integer representing the length of the decimal number, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. The function can return different values based on the following cases:

- Case 1: If `p` is a positive integer divisible by 42 and `x` is 5, the function returns the value of `result_func_1` multiplied by (p / 42).
- Case 2: If `i` is 1000, `s` is the result of the last call to `func_1(i, x)`, and either `x` is not equal to 5 or `p` is not divisible by 42, the function returns a different value based on the conditions met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `p` and an integer `x` between 1 and 9 inclusive, and return a calculated value based on the specified cases related to the values of `p` and `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `p` and an integer `x` (1-9 inclusive), returning a value based on the conditions of `p` and `x` related to divisibility by 42 and the specific value of `x`.**
