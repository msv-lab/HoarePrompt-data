The value of `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`. The previous values of `n_moves` and `res` do not change directly from this assignment, but `i2` will impact the calculation of `n_moves` in subsequent operations. The specific value of `end_m[v1]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `i2`. The output state retains the definitions of `n_moves` and `res`, while incorporating the new assignment of `i2`. 

Output State: **`n_moves` is `i2 - i1`, `res` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n_moves`, with `i2` being assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`.**
