The variable `end_m` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The previous values of the variables `n`, `start`, and `start_m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index, and `end_m` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index, and `end_m` is an empty dictionary.**
