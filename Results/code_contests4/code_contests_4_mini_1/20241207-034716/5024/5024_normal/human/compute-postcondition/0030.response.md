The value of `n_moves` is updated to `n - i1`. The previous value of `n_moves` was `i2 - i1`, so after the execution, the new value of `n_moves` will depend on the current value of `n` and `i1`. The other variables (`res`, `i2`, and `end_m[v1]`) are not affected by this specific line of code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `n_moves` based on the current values of `n` and `i1`.

Output State: **`n_moves` is updated to `n - i1`**
