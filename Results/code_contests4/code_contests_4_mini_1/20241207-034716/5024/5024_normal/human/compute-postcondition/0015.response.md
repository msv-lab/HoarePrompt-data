The variable `end_m` is updated to assign `index` (which is 1) to the key `val` in the dictionary `end_m`. The previous value of `end_m[val]` was already 1, so it remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index; `end` is a list with at least 2 elements; `index` is 1; `val` is the second element in the list `end`; `end_m[val]` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index; `end` is a list with at least 2 elements; `index` is 1; `val` is the second element in the list `end`; `end_m[val]` is still 1.**
