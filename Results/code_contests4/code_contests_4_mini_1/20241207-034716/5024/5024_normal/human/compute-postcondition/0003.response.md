The code `start_m = {}` initializes an empty dictionary and assigns it to the variable `start_m`. The values of `n`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers derived from input; `end` is a list of integers derived from input; `start_m` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers derived from input; `end` is a list of integers derived from input; `start_m` is an empty dictionary.**
