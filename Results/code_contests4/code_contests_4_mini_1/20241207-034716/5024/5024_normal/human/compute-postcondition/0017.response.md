The code assigns the value of `index` to the key `val` in the dictionary `end_m`. The previous value of `end_m[val]` is 1, and since `index` is 2, `end_m[val]` is updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index; `end` is a list with at least 3 elements; `index` is 2; `val` is the third element in the list `end`; `end_m[val]` is now 2.
