The value of `n_moves` is reassigned to `n - i1`. Given that `n_moves` is originally `i2 - i1` and is less than 0, this indicates that `i2` is less than `i1`. The new value of `n_moves` will depend on the value of `n` and `i1`. Since the specific values for `n` and `i1` are not provided, we can only state the relationship. 

The output state will reflect that `n_moves` is now calculated as `n - i1`, but without specific values for `n` or `i1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical outcome.

Output State: **`n_moves` is now `n - i1`, where `n_moves` is less than 0; `i2` is less than `i1`.**
