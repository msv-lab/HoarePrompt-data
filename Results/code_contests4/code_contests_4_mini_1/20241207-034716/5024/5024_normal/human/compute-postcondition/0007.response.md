The code assigns the value of `index` to `start_m[val]`. The previous state indicates that `val` is the second element of the `start` list, and `index` is 1. Therefore, `start_m[val]` will now hold the value 1. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `index` is 1, `val` is the second element of the `start` list, `start_m[val]` is 1**
