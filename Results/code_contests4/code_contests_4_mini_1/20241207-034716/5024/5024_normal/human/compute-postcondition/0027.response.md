According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `start_m` dictionary. The loop iterates over the items of `start_m`, so for it to execute one more time, there must be at least one more item in `start_m` after the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n_moves` is `i2 - i1`, and `res` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n_moves`. 

Since the loop is using the items of `start_m`, if the last item processed was `(v1, i1)`, we need to consider what the next item will be. If there are more items in `start_m`, the next iteration will provide a new value `v1` and a new index `i1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state must reflect that it is processing the next item in `start_m`. 

State: **`n_moves` is `i2 - i1`, `res` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n_moves`, for the loop to execute one more time `start_m` must have at least one more item, with `i1` being the next index from `start_m`.**
