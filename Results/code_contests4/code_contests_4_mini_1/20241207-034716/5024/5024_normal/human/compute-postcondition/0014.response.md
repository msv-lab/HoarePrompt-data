According to the code, the loop will execute again based on the length of the `end` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can run for a second iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 0 and `val` is the first element in the `end` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `index` must be incremented to 1, and `val` must be the second element in the `end` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index; `end` is a list with at least 2 elements; `index` is 1; `val` is the second element in the list `end`; `end_m[val]` is 1**
