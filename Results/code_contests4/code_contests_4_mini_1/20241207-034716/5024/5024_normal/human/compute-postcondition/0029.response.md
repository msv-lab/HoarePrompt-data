The value of `n_moves` is assigned the result of `i2 - i1`. The previous value of `n_moves` is not specified, but it is updated based on the new calculation. The other variables are not affected by this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_moves` is `i2 - i1`, `res` remains updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n_moves`, with `i2` being assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`.

Output State: **`n_moves` is `i2 - i1`, `res` remains updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n_moves`, with `i2` being assigned the value of `end_m[v1]**
