The `start` list is assigned the values obtained from splitting the input line read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and converting each element to an integer. The previous value of `n` is not directly affected by this operation, but it indicates that the input will be read based on `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and can potentially dictate the number of elements read, the output state reflects that `start` is now a list of integers derived from the input. The specifics of the values in `start` depend on the input, which is not provided. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers derived from input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers derived from input.**
