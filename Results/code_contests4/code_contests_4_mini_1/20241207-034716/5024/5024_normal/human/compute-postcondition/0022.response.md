The variable `n_moves` is assigned the value of `i2 - i1`. Here, `i1` is the corresponding index for `v1` from `start_m`, and `i2` is the index of `v1` in the `end` list, obtained from `end_m`. The values of `i1` and `i2` are determined by the current state of the dictionaries and lists provided. 

Since no specific values are given for `i1` and `i2`, we cannot provide exact numerical results. Thus, the output state reflects the relationship of the variables involved. 

Output State: **`n_moves` is `i2 - i1`, where `i1` is the index from `start_m` for `v1` and `i2` is the index of `v1` in `end` obtained from `end_m`.**
