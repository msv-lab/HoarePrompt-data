The code assigns the current value of `index` to the key `val` in the dictionary `end_m`. The variable `val` holds the first element of the list `end`, and `index` is currently 0. Consequently, the entry `end_m[val]` is set to 0. This operation does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index; `end` is a list with at least 1 element; `index` is 0; `val` is the first element in the list `end`; `end_m[val]` is 0.**
