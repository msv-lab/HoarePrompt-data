The value of `n_moves` is assigned the difference between `i2` and `i1`. The previous value of `n_moves` was updated to be the maximum of its previous value and itself, but it becomes irrelevant for this calculation as we are directly assigning a new value. The new value of `n_moves` will depend on the values of `i2` and `i1`. Other variables `res` and `i2` remain unchanged by this line of code, as the maximum updates were performed earlier.

Output State: **`n_moves` is assigned the value `i2 - i1`, `res` remains updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n_moves`, `i2` is assigned the value `end_m[v1]`**.
