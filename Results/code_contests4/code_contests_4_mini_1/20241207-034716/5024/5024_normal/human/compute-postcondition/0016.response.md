According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `end` list. The loop will execute again if there is a third element in the `end` list. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 1, and `val` corresponds to the second element in the `end` list. Since `end` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute, and since it currently has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements. Therefore, `index` will be incremented to 2, and `val` will be the third element in the list `end`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `start` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `start_m` is a dictionary mapping each element in `start` to its corresponding index; `end` is a list with at least 3 elements; `index` is 2; `val` is the third element in the list `end`; `end_m[val]` is still 1.**
