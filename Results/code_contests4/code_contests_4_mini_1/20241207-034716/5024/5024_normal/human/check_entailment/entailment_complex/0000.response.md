Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in how the program calculates the number of moves required to rearrange the first permutation into the second.

1. The program attempts to calculate `n_moves` based on the difference between the indices of elements in the two permutations. However, the way it calculates `n_moves` and the logic that follows does not accurately reflect the minimum number of moves necessary to transform the first permutation into the second. The program currently calculates the maximum possible "shift" that can be achieved for each element but does not correctly account for how many elements are already in the correct relative order.

2. The logic fails to consider that the goal is to determine how many elements are already in their correct position in the second permutation. The correct algorithm should focus on finding the longest suffix of the first permutation that matches the second permutation. This information can then be used to calculate how many moves are required by subtracting the length of this matching suffix from `n`.

3. The current approach leads to incorrect results in cases where the permutations are not as straightforward as the examples provided. It does not correctly handle the situation where multiple elements must be moved, as it only tracks the maximum of an arbitrary calculation rather than the actual necessary moves.

Thus, the program does not align with the problem requirements and will yield incorrect outputs in specific scenarios.
