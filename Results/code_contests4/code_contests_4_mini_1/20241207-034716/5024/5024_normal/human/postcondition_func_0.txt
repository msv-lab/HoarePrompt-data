The function reads a positive integer n and two permutations of unique integers from 1 to n. It calculates the maximum number of moves required to rearrange the first permutation into the second by shifting elements around in a circular manner. The function then prints this maximum number of moves. It does not accept parameters directly, as it reads input from standard input.
