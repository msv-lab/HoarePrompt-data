Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum total number of attacks required to vanish the monster, but the current implementation does not consider all possible scenarios. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 10
3 5
2 6
```
The expected output is 2, as the minimum total number of attacks required is 2. However, the code might not handle this case correctly. 

The output hints do align with the problem description and do provide a clear explanation of what the code is supposed to do. However, the code itself seems to have issues in correctly calculating the minimum total number of attacks.
