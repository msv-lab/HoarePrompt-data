Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for N, H, a_i, and b_i correctly. It then calculates the minimum total number of attacks required to vanish the monster based on the given conditions. The program correctly calculates the maximum damage that can be dealt by a single attack using the maximum value in the list A. It then sorts and reverses the list B to ensure that the largest damage values are considered first.

The program correctly iterates through the list B and calculates the total damage dealt to the monster. It stops when the total damage exceeds or equals H. The program then prints the minimum total number of attacks required.

The program follows the problem description and calculates the minimum number of attacks needed to defeat the monster in all cases.
