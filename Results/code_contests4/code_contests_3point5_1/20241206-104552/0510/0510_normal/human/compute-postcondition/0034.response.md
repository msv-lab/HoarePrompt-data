Output State: **N is greater than 0, a contains the last integer input, b contains the value of B at index bi, A contains all the integers entered in order, B contains the reversed list of all integers entered with -1 appended at the end, am contains the maximum value from the list A, h is either increased by the value of b or set to 0, c is either the result of the calculation c += int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am)) or 1, bi is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time h is less than H and for the loop to execute again h is still less than H. If b < am, b is less than am. If b is not less than am, b is greater or equal to am, b is assigned the value of B at index bi.**
