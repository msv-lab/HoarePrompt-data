Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are assigned through user input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown. Therefore, after execution, `a` contains the first integer input and `b` contains the second integer input. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop will execute one more time, so `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `a` contains the first integer input, `b` contains the second integer input, `A` contains the value of `a`, `B` contains the value of `b` added to its previous contents, `i` is increased by 1**
