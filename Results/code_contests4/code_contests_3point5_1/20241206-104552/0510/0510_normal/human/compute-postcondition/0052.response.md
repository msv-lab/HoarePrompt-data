Functionality: **The function `func` reads integer inputs for `N` and `H`, then reads pairs of integers `a` and `b` into lists `A` and `B` respectively. It calculates the maximum possible sum of integers from the ranges [a_i, b_i] where 1 ≤ i ≤ N, ensuring that the sum does not exceed the integer H. The function prints the maximum possible sum calculated and considers edge cases such as when the sum exceeds H or when B is empty.**
