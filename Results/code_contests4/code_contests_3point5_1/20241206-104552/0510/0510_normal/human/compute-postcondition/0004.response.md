Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user and splits it into integers. However, the initial value of `N` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input**
