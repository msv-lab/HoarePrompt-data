Example Answer:
`A` is a list that appends the value of `a`. The values of `N`, `a`, and `b` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input, `A` contains the value of `a`.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input, `A` contains the value of `a`**
