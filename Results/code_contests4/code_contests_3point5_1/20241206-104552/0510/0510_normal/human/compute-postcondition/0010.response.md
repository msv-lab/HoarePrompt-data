Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the list `B`. The previous value of `B` is unknown, so after execution, `B` will contain the value of `b` added to its previous contents. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `a` contains the first integer input, `b` contains the second integer input, `A` contains the value of `a` appended, `B` contains the updated list with the value of `b` added to its previous contents, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `a` contains the first integer input, `b` contains the second integer input, `A` contains the value of `a` appended, `B` contains the updated list with the value of `b` added to its previous contents, `i` is increased by 1**
