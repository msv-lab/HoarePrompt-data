According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If N is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `B` is initially an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0.
State: **`N` is greater than 0**
