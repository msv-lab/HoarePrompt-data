According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `H`. If `h` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is less than `H`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` needs to still be less than `H`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is greater than 0, a contains the last integer input, b contains the value of B at index bi, A contains all the integers entered in order, B contains the reversed list of all integers entered with -1 appended at the end, am contains the maximum value from the list A, h is either increased by the value of b or set to 0, c is either the result of the calculation c += int(ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am)) or 1, bi is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time h is less than H and for the loop to execute again h is still less than H, bi is increased by 1**
