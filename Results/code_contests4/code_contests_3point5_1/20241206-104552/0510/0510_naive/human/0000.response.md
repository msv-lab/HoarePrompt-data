Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum total number of attacks required to vanish the monster in all potential cases. 

One potential case where the program fails is when the input is:

```
2 10
3 5
4 6
```

The expected output should be 2, as the monster can be defeated with just one attack from the second katana. However, the program will output 3, as it does not consider choosing the optimal katana for each attack.
