Example Answer: 
The program simply prints 0. There are no changes to the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input, d is calculated. The distance between circles A and B is greater than the sum of their radii squared.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input, d is calculated. The distance between circles A and B is greater than the sum of their radii squared.**
