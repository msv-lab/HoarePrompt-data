Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the number 2. There are no changes to the variables `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb`, or `d`. Therefore, the Output State is: `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been updated with new values from input; `d` holds the calculated value.
Output State: **`xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been updated with new values from input; `d` holds the calculated value**
