Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The distance `d` between the two circles A and B is less than or equal to (ra + rb). The radius of circle A, `ra`, is greater than the radius of circle B, `rb`. The square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`.***
