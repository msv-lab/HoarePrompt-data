Postcondition: ***`xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been updated with new values from input; `d` holds the calculated value. If (rb - ra) ** 2 is greater than `d`, the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` and `d` remain the same, and the program prints the integer 1.***
