Postcondition: ***`n`, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are integers. `n` is greater than 0. The distance `d` between the two circles A and B is calculated. If the distance between circles A and B is greater than the sum of their radii squared, then a specific action is performed. If the distance between circles A and B is less than or equal to (ra + rb), and if ra > rb, then the radius of circle A is greater than the radius of circle B, and a specific action is performed. If ra - rb, else, the radius of circle A is less than or equal to the radius of circle B, and a different action is performed.***
