Postcondition: ***The coordinates and radius of two circles A and B are represented by `n`, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` with the conditions mentioned in the initial state. The distance `d` between the two circles A and B is less than or equal to (ra + rb). Additionally, ra is less than or equal to rb. If (rb - ra) ** 2 > d, the program prints ((rb - ra) ** 2). Otherwise, the program prints ((rb - ra)).***
