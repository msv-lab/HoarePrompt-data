Postcondition: ***`n`, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are integers. `n` is greater than 0. The distance `d` between the two circles A and B is less than or equal to (ra + rb). If ra > rb, then the radius of circle A is greater than the radius of circle B, and the function performs a specific action. If ra - rb, else, the radius of circle A is less than or equal to the radius of circle B, and the function performs a different action.***
