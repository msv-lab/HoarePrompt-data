Functionality: The function `func` reads input data representing the coordinates and radii of two circles A and B. It then calculates the distance between the circles and based on the relationship between the circles, it prints out specific results. If Circle A is completely inside Circle B, it prints 0. If Circle B is completely inside Circle A, it prints -2. If the circles intersect but do not completely contain each other, it prints 1 or 2 depending on the radii. The function handles comparisons between the circles to determine their relationship.
