Postcondition: ***The coordinates and radius of two circles A and B are represented by `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input, and the distance `d` is calculated. The distance `d` between the two circles A and B is less than or equal to (ra + rb). Additionally, ra is less than or equal to rb. The expression ((rb - ra) ** 2 > d) is false***
