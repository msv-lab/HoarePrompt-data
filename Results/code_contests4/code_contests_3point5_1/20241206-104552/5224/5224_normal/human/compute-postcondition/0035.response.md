Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated based on the formula provided. It calculates the squared Euclidean distance between points `(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)`. The variables `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are updated with new values from input, but `ra` and `rb` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are updated with new values from input, `d` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are updated with new values from input, `d` is calculated based on the formula**
