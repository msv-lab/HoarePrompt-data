Example Answer:
The variable `d` is calculated as the square of the difference between `xa` and `xb` squared, added to the square of the difference between `ya` and `yb` squared. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` have been updated with new values, and `d` is now calculated based on these updated values. The radius variables `ra` and `rb` are not involved in this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been updated with new values from input; `d` holds the calculated value.
Output State: **`xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been updated with new values from input; `d` holds the calculated value**
