The function `func` accepts no parameters. Instead, it operates on the coordinates and radius of two circles A and B, which are provided in the dataset. The function will compare the circles A and B to determine one of the following outcomes:

Case_1: If Circle A is completely inside Circle B, the function returns "Circle A is inside Circle B".

Case_2: If Circle B is completely inside Circle A, the function returns "Circle B is inside Circle A".

Case_3: If the circles intersect but do not completely contain each other, the function returns "Circle A and Circle B intersect".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to compare the two circles A and B based on their coordinates and radius, and determine their relationship (inside, outside, or intersecting).
