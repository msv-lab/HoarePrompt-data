Example Answer:
The distance `d` between the centers of circles A and B is calculated using the formula provided. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the coordinates of the centers of circles A and B respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: The coordinates and radius of two circles A and B are represented by `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input, and the distance `d` is calculated.
