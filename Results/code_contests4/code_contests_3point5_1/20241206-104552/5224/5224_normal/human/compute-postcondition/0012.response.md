Postcondition: ***`n`, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are integers. `n` is greater than 0. The distance `d` between the two circles A and B is less than or equal to (ra + rb). The radius of circle A, `ra`, is greater than the radius of circle B. If (ra - rb) ** 2 is greater than `d`, then the expression ((ra - rb) is not used in the calculation, and the value 1 is printed. Otherwise, the square of the difference between `ra` and `rb` is greater than `d`.***
