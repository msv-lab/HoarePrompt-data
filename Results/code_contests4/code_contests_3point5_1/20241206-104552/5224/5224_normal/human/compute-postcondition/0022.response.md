Example Answer:
`xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The values of `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been updated based on the input. The variable `d` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` have been updated with new values from input; `d` remains unchanged**
