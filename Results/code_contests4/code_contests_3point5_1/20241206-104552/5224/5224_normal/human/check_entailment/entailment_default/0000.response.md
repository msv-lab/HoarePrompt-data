Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not handle the case when the circumference of circle A and B intersect. This is evident from the code's logic which only checks if one circle is completely inside the other or if they do not overlap at all. However, the problem description clearly states that the code should also consider the case when the circumference of the circles intersect, which is missing in the code.
- Additionally, the condition `(ra - rb) ** 2 > d` for checking if circle B is completely inside circle A is incorrect. This condition should be modified to `(ra + rb) ** 2 > d` to accurately determine if circle B is inside circle A.
