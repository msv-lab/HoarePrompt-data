Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the distance between the two circles A and B and compares it to the sum and difference of their radii to determine their relationship. It then prints the corresponding result as specified in the problem description. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each dataset.
