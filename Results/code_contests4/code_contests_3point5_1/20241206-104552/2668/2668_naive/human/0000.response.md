The given program does not seem to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program seems to be convoluted and does not directly address the problem statement. It is difficult to determine if the program will output the correct movie index based on the given input. The program uses functions like `func_1` and `func_2` which are not intuitive and do not directly relate to the problem description. Additionally, the usage of file I/O operations like reading from 'input.txt' and writing to 'output.txt' is not in line with the standard input/output format specified in the problem description.
