Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues:
1. The program is missing the necessary import statements for `os` and `sys`.
2. The `func_1` function uses `xrange` which is not a valid function in Python 3. It should be replaced with `range`.
3. The output is being written to a file in `output.txt` without a newline character, which may lead to issues in reading the output.
4. The logic in `func_2` seems to be overly complex and unclear, making it difficult to understand the purpose and correctness of the code.

Overall, the program lacks clarity and has potential issues with correctness due to the issues mentioned above.
