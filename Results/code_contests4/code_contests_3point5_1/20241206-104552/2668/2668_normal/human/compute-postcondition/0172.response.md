Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `back`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `res`, `i+1`, `templis` remain unchanged. If there exists a `z` such that `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)[0]` is True, `anss` will be assigned the final value of `back` after the loop breaks out. If no such `z` exists, `anss` will maintain the value it had before the loop.**
