Postcondition: ***`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `res`, `i+1`, `templis`, `anss` remain unchanged. `z` is increased by 2. If `back[0]` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `anss` is assigned the final value of `back`. If `back[0]` is False, there is no change in the variables.***
