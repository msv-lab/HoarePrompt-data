Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res` are all in their respective states; `back[0]` is true, `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples with the values of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is the last valid index of `subs`, `uniques` has a length of at least `z + 1`, `z` is the last valid index of `uniques` for the loop to execute the final time, the first element of `back` is true, and `res` is True. We break out of the loop with the final value of `anss`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `uniques`.**
