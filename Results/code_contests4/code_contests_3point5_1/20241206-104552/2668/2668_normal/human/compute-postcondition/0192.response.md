According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `uniques`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 which makes `i` equal to 2.
State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs` are sorted in ascending order. `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back` are assigned the return value of `func_1`. `res` is True. `i` is 2. `back[0]` is True. `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
