Output State: **`output` is assigned the value of `anss[1] where `anss` is the value from the last iteration where `back[0]` is True. All other variables remain sorted in ascending order. `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back` are assigned the return value of `func_1`. `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` is True, otherwise False. `i` is the index of the last iteration.**
