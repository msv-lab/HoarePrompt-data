Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples with an additional tuple appended, `i` is the index of the last element processed in `init` list incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the `init` list. If `i` is 0, it means all elements in `init` have been processed and the program is ready to terminate.**
