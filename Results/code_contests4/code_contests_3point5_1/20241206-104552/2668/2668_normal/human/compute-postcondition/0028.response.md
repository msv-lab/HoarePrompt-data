Example Answer:
A tuple containing the value 1 and the element at index `i` from the `init` list is appended to the `counts` list. The `i` variable is incremented by 1, so the index of the last element processed is updated. If `i` was initially 0, the program remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples with an additional tuple appended, `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the `init` list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples with an additional tuple appended, `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the `init` list**
