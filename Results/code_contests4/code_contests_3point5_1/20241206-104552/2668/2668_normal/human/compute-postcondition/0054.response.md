Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value of the integer input read from the input. The previous values of the variables `n`, `init`, `counts`, `i`, `x`, and `uniques` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples representing the counts of consecutive elements in `init`, `i` is the index of the last tuple in `counts` before the loop exits, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains all unique tuples from `counts` where the count value changes and now `uniques` is sorted in descending order, `m` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples representing the counts of consecutive elements in `init`, `i` is the index of the last tuple in `counts` before the loop exits, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains all unique tuples from `counts` where the count value changes and now `uniques` is sorted in descending order, `m` is an input integer**
