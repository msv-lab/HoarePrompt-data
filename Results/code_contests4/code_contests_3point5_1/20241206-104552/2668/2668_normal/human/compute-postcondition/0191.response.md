Postcondition: ***`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs` are sorted in ascending order. `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back` are assigned the return value of `func_1`. `res` is True. `i` is 1. `back[0]` is True. `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
