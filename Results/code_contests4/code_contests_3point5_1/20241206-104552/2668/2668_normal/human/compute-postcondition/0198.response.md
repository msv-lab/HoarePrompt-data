Output State: **After the loop executes, `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs` are still sorted in ascending order. `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back` are assigned the return value of `func_1`. `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` is True, otherwise False. `i` is the index of the last iteration. `anss` is assigned the value of `back` from the last iteration where `back[0]` is True.**
