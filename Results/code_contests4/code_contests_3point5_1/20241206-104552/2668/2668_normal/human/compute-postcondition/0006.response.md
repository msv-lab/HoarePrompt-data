Example Answer:
`init` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input read from `input.readline().split()`. The value of `n` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer read from the input source.
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source**
