Postcondition: ***All variables `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res`, `i+1` are in their initial states. After the execution of the if statement, if there exists a `z` such that `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)[0]` is True, the final value of `back` will be assigned to `anss`. If no such `z` exists, `anss` will maintain its value from before the loop.***
