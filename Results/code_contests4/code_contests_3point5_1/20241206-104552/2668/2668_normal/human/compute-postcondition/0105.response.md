Postcondition: ***`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` are assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is an empty list, `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is the last valid index of `subs`, `uniques` has a length of at least `z + 1`, `z` is the last valid index of `uniques`, the first element of `back` is true, `res` is True, we break out of the loop with the final value of `anss`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `uniques, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element and `y` is the first valid index of `subs`, and the condition `(audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1])` is true***
