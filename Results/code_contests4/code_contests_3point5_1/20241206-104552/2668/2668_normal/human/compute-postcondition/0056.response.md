Example Answer:
The `subs` list is assigned the result of mapping input values to integers using `map(int, input.readline().split())`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples representing the counts of consecutive elements in `init`, `i` is the index of the last tuple in `counts` before the loop exits, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains all unique tuples from `counts` where the count value changes and now `uniques` is sorted in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `audio` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input values to integers, `subs` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input values to integers.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples representing the counts of consecutive elements in `init`, `i` is the index of the last tuple in `counts` before the loop exits, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains all unique tuples from `counts` where the count value changes and now `uniques` is sorted in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `audio` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input values to integers, `subs` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input values to integers**
