Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The values of `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `z`, and the length of `templis` are used as arguments in the function call. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples with the values of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is the last valid index of `subs`, `uniques` has a length of at least 1, `z` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `back` is assigned the return value of the function call.
Output State: **`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples with the values of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is the last valid index of `subs`, `uniques` has a length of at least 1, `z` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `back` is assigned the return value of the function call**
