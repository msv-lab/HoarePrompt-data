Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the variables maintain their ascending order. `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs` are sorted in ascending order. `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back` are assigned the return value of `func_1`. `res` is True if at least one `back[0]` is True, otherwise False. `i` is the index of the last iteration. If `res` is True, `output` is assigned the value of `anss[1]` from the last iteration where `back[0]` is True. If `res` is False, `output` is assigned the value 1. Additionally, if 'output.txt' exists, the content is updated with the new value of `output`. If 'output.txt' does not exist, the output is written to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write(str(output))`.***
