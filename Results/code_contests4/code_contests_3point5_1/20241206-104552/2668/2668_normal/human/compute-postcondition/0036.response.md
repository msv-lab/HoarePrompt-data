Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples representing the counts of consecutive elements in `init`, `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list, `x` is the last element in the `init` list, `uniques` contains the last tuple from `counts`, `i` is the index of the last tuple in `counts` before the append operation, `x` is the last element of that tuple. The index `i` is equal to the length of `counts`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
