Postcondition: ***`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` are the final values of `back`, `subs` has a length greater than 0, `y` is set to the third index of `subs`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res`, `i+1` are in their respective states, the loop breaks out with the final value of `anss`, `templis` has at least one element and an additional tuple appended to it, the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i`, and a tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)` is appended to `templis` if the condition `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]` is satisfied.***
