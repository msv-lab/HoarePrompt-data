Example Answer:
The list `init` is sorted in descending order using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse=True` parameter. The previous value of `init` is unknown, so the sorted list is the new value of `init`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer read from the input source; `init` is a sorted list in descending order.
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source; `init` is a sorted list in descending order**
