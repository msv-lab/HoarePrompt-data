Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. The value of `back` is now updated based on the function call. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `templis`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z+1`, `back` is updated, `res` is True, `i`, `anss`, `z` is incremented by 1, `anss` is now assigned the value of `back`.
Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `templis`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z+1`, `back` is updated, `res` is True, `i`, `anss`, `z` is incremented by 1, `anss` is now assigned the value of `back`**
