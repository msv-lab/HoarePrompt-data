Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 0, `x` is the largest element in the `init` list. If init[i] == init[i - 1], a new tuple is appended to `counts` with the first element being one more than the last element of `counts` and the second element being the value of `init` at index `i`. Otherwise, if init[i] != init[i - 1], counts list now contains an additional tuple (1, element at index i of init) while maintaining the initial state of the program variables.***
