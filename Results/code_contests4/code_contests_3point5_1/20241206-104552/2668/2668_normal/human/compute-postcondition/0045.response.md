Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` has at least one more tuple left, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `counts`, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains the newly appended tuple. If the condition `counts[i][1] != counts[i + 1][1]` is true, the state remains the same. If the condition is false, the state remains unchanged.***
