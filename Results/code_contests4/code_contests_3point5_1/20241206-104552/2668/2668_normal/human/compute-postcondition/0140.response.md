Example Answer:
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` is the final value of `back`, `templis`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res`, `i+1` are all in their respective states and the loop breaks out with the final value of `anss`.
Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` is the final value of `back`, `templis`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res`, `i+1` are all in their respective states and the loop breaks out with the final value of `anss`.**
