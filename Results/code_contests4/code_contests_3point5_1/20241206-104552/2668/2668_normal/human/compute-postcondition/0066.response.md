According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `subs` list. If the `subs` list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `anss` is assigned the value of `back` and `templis` is an empty list. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `subs` must have at least 1 element, `y` is 0, and `back` is assigned to `anss`.

State: **`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `subs` has at least 1 element, `y` is 0**
