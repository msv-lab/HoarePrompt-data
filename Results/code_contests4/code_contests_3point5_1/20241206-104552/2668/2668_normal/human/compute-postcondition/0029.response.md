Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples with an additional tuple appended, `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the `init` list. If `i` is 0, the program remains unchanged. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, a new tuple is appended to `counts` with the first element as the last element of the previous tuple incremented by 1, and the second element as the next element in the `init` list. Otherwise, the program remains the same as before.***
