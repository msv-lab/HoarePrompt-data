Example Answer: 
`res` is assigned the boolean value True. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state remains the same for all variables.
Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res`, `i+1` are all in their respective states. The loop breaks out with the final value of `anss`**
