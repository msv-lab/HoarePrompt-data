According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `uniques`. If the length is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to 0 to indicate the start of the loop. 
State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs` is sorted in ascending order, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res` are in their respective states, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
