Output State: **`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples representing the counts of consecutive elements in `init`, `i` is the index of the last tuple in `counts` before the loop exits, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains all unique tuples from `counts` where the count value changes and is now sorted in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `audio` is a list of tuples where each element is a tuple containing an element from `audio` and its index starting from 1, `subs` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input values to integers, `res` is False, `anss` is 0, `audio2` is a sorted version of `audio`.**
