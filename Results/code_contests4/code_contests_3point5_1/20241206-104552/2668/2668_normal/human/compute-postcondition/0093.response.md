Output State: **`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples with the values of `subs[y]` and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is the last valid index of `subs`, `uniques` has a length of at least 1, `z` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `back` is assigned the return value of the function call, the first element of `back` is true, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
