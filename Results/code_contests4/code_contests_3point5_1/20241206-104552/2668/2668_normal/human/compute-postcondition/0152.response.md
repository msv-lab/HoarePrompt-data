Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` are the final values of `back`, `subs` has a length greater than 0, `y` is set to the last index of `subs`, `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res`, `i+1` are in their respective states, the loop breaks out with the final value of `anss`, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for all `y` in `subs` where the condition `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]` is satisfied.**
