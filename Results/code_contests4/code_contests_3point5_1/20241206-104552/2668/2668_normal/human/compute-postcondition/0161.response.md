Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, 0, and `len(templis) - 1`. The variables `uniques`, `templis`, `z` are used as parameters, but their values are not affected. `back` will hold the return value of `func_1`.  
Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `back`, `subs`, `y`, `uniques`, `res`, `i+1`, `templis` remain unchanged. `anss` is assigned the final value of `back` after the loop breaks out. `z` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. `back` holds the result of calling `func_1` with the specified arguments.**
