Example Answer:
The code tries to read an integer from the input source which is either a file named 'input.txt' or the standard input if the file does not exist. The value read is stored in variable `n`. The previous values of the variables are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer read from the input source.
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source**
