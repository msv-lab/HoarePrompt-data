Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples with an additional tuple appended, `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the `init` list**
