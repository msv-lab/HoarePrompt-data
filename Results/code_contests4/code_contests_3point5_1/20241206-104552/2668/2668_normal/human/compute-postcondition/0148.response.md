Postcondition: ***`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` are the final values of `back`. `subs` has a length greater than 0. `y` is set to the second index of `subs`. `uniques`, `z`, `back`, `res`, `i+1` are in their respective states. The loop breaks out with the final value of `anss`. `templis` has at least one element and an additional tuple appended to it. The first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i.`***
