Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` has at least one more tuple left, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `counts`, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains the last tuple from `counts`. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `counts`, then `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` has at least one more tuple left, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `counts`, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains the newly appended tuple, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
