Postcondition: ***`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains a tuple with the values of `subs[y]` and `y + 1`, `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is 0. If the first element of `audio` at index `y` is equal to the second element of `uniques` at index `i`, then the program state remains the same.***
