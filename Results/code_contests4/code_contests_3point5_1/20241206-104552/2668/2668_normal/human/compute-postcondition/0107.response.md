Postcondition: ***`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` are assigned the value of `back`. `templis` has one more element appended with the tuple `(subs[y], y + 1)`. `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is the last valid index of `subs`. `uniques` has a length of at least `z + 1`, `z` is the last valid index of `uniques`. The first element of `back` is true, `res` is True. We break out of the loop with the final value of `anss`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `uniques. For the loop to execute the first time, `subs` has at least 1 element and `y` is the first valid index of `subs. Additionally, `templis` is appended with one more element containing `(subs[y], y + 1)` if the condition `(audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1])` is true.***
