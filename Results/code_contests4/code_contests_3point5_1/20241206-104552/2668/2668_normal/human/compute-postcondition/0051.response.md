Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` has at least one more tuple left, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `counts`, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains the newly appended tuple. If i + 1 equals the length of `counts`, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If `counts[i][1]` is not equal to `counts[i + 1][1]`, then the program updates the state accordingly based on the conditions stated in the program.***
