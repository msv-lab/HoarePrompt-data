Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value `True`, which is explicitly set in the code. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the initial state. `func_1` is called with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`. The value of `back[0]` evaluates to true. `res` is True.
Output State: **No change in the initial state. `func_1` is called with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`. The value of `back[0]` evaluates to true. `res` is True.**
