Example Answer:
`counts` is assigned a list containing a tuple with values (1, the first element of the sorted list `init`). Since `init` is sorted in descending order, the first element is the largest. Therefore, the tuple in `counts` will have a count of 1 for the largest element in `init`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source; `init` is a sorted list in descending order; `counts` is a list containing a tuple (1, largest element of `init`)**
