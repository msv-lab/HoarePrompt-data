Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss` are assigned the value of `back`, `templis` contains tuples `(subs[y], y + 1)` for all valid `y` indices in `subs` where the condition `(audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1])` is true, `subs` still has at least 1 element, `y` is the last valid index of `subs`, `uniques` has a length of at least `z + 1`, `z` is the last valid index of `uniques`, the first element of `back` is true, `res` is True, `i` is 0**
