Example Answer:
`uniques` appends the tuple `counts[i]` to itself. Since `counts` has at least one more tuple left, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `counts`, `x` is the last element of that tuple, and `uniques` contains the last tuple from `counts`, after the operation `uniques` will have the newly appended tuple. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` has at least one more tuple left, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `counts`, `x` is the last element of that tuple, `uniques` contains the newly appended tuple**
