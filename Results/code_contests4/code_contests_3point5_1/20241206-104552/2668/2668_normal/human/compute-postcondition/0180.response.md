Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`. Since `i` is 0 and the loop is executing for the first time, `uniques[i][1]` corresponds to the first element in `uniques` array. The function `func_1` will return a value based on the input parameters. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs` is sorted in ascending order, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back` is assigned the return value of `func_1`, `res`, `i` is still 0.
Output State: **`uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, `anss`, `templis`, `subs` is sorted in ascending order, `y`, `uniques`, `z`, `back` is assigned the return value of `func_1`, `res`, `i` is still 0**
