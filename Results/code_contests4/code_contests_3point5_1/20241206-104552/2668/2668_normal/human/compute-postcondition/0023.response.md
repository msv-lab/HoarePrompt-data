Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples with an additional tuple appended, `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the `init` list. If `i` is 0, it means all elements in `init` have been processed, and the program is ready to terminate. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, a tuple is added to `counts` and `i` is incremented. Otherwise, `n`, `init`, `counts`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.***
