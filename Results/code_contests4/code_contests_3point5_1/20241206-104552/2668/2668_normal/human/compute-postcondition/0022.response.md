Example Answer:
A tuple `(1, init[i])` is appended to the `counts` list. The value of `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list incremented by 1, so the tuple `(1, init[i])` is created using the next element in the `init` list denoted by `x`. Therefore, after execution, the `counts` list will have an additional tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a sorted list in descending order with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list containing tuples with an additional tuple appended, `i` is the index of the last element processed in the `init` list incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the `init` list**
