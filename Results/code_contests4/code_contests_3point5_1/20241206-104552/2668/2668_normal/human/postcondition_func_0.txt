The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `num`, `lis1`, `low`, and `high`. It performs a binary search on the list `lis1` to find the value of `num`. If the value is found, it returns True along with the corresponding value at index 1 of the list `lis1`. If `num` is not found, it returns False along with -1. The function handles the edge cases of the loop terminating without finding a match by returning False and -1.
