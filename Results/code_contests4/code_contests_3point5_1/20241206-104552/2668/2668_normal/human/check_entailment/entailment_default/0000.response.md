Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The output hints indicate that the program should find the movie that maximizes the number of very pleased scientists and then choose one among those that maximizes the number of almost satisfied scientists. However, upon examining the code, it is evident that the implementation may not always choose the movie that maximizes the number of almost satisfied scientists.

The function `func_2` reads the input data, processes it, and tries to find the movie that satisfies the scientists' preferences. It utilizes the `func_1` function for binary search operations. However, the logic within the `func_2` function has some issues that prevent it from always selecting the correct movie.

One particular case where the code may fail to adhere to the problem description is when there are multiple movies that maximize the number of very pleased scientists but differ in the number of almost satisfied scientists. The code does not explicitly handle this scenario, potentially leading to incorrect movie selection.

Therefore, due to the possible discrepancies between the code logic and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed as **False**.
