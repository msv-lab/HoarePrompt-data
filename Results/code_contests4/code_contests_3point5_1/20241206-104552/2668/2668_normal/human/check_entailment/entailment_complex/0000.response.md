Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` attempts to find the movie that maximizes the number of very pleased scientists and almost satisfied scientists, but it is not handling all edge cases correctly.

One potential case where the code may not work correctly is when there are multiple movies with the same maximum number of very pleased scientists. In this scenario, the code does not specify how to choose among these movies to maximize the number of almost satisfied scientists. The problem description states that if there are several such movies, one should be selected that maximizes the number of almost satisfied scientists.

Therefore, the code needs to be updated to handle this edge case and ensure that it follows the problem description for every potential case.
