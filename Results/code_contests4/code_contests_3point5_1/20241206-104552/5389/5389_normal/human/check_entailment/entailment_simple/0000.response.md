Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum sum of burles Vasya will have to spend on the tickets by iterating over the number of rides Vasya is going to make on buses and trolleys and calculating the minimum cost for each type of ticket. It then compares the total costs for buses and trolleys with the unlimited ticket costs and outputs the minimum sum. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
