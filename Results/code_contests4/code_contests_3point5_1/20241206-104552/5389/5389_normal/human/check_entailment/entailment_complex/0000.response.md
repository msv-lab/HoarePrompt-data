Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the sum of minimum values between elements of arrays `bus` and `trol` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, and then computes the result based on the conditions involving `c3` and `c4`. The final result is printed as output, which aligns with the problem description. It covers all possible cases and provides the correct output.
