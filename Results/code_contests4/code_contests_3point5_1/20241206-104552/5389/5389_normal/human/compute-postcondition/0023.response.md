Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `res`. The value of `res` is calculated based on the initial values of `bussum`, `trolsum`, `c3`, and `c4`. The minimum value between `bussum` and `c3` is calculated and added to the minimum value between `trolsum` and `c3`. Then, the minimum value between the result and `c4` is taken and stored in `res`. Finally, the value of `res` is printed.
Output State: **`res` is printed**
