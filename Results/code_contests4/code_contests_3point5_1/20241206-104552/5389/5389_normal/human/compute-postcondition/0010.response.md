Example Answer:
`bussum` is incremented by the minimum value between the product of the first element of `bus` and `c1` or `c2`. The values of `c1` and `c2` are already assigned, and the elements of `bus` are not explicitly given. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is increased by the minimum value between the product of the first element of `bus` and `c1` or `c2`, `trolsum` is 0, `bus` still has elements left to iterate over.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is increased by the minimum value between the product of the first element of `bus` and `c1` or `c2`, `trolsum` is 0, `bus` still has elements left to iterate over**
