Example Answer:
`busc1` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting, `busc1` is an empty list.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting, `busc1` is an empty list**
