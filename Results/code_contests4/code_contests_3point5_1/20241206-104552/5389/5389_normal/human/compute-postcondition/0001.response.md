Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting. The values of `n` and `m` are dependent on the input values, so without knowing the input, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting**
