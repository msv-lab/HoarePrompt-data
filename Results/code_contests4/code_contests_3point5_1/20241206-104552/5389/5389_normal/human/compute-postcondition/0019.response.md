Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is the sum of the minimum values between each element of `bus` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, `trolsum` is updated based on the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2`, for the loop to execute one more time `trol` is not empty, `x` is the next element in `trol`, `trolsum` is increased by the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2`, where `trolsum` is incremented by the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2`.**
