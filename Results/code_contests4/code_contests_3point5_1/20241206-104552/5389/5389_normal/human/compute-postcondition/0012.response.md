Example Answer:
`bussum` is increased by the minimum value between the product of the first element of `bus` and `c1` or `c2`. The value of `bussum` will be updated based on the comparison of the product `x * c1` and `c2`, where `x` represents the first element of `bus`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is updated based on the minimum value between the product of the first element of `bus` and `c1` or `c2`, `trolsum` is 0, `bus` still has elements left to iterate over.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is updated based on the minimum value between the product of the first element of `bus` and `c1` or `c2`, `trolsum` is 0, `bus` still has elements left to iterate over**
