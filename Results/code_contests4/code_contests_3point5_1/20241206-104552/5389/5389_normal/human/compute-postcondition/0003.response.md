Example Answer:
The list `trol` is assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting. Since `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `n`, and `m` are already assigned their integer values extracted from the input after splitting, they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting**
