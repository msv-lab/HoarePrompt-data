According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `bus`. If the list `bus` still has elements left, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `bus` had at least one element. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned integer values, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is increased by the minimum value between the product of the first element of `bus` and `c1` or `c2`, `trolsum` is 0, `bus` still has elements left to iterate over**
