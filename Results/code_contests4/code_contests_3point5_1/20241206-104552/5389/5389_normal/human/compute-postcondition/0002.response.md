Example Answer:
The list `bus` is created by converting each element of the input split by spaces into an integer. The variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `n`, and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting; `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input after splitting**
