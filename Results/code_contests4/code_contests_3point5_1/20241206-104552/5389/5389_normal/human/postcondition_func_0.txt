The function `func` reads input values from the user, calculates the sum of minimum values between elements of arrays `bus` and `trol` multiplied by `c1` and `c2`, then computes the result based on conditions involving `c3` and `c4`. The final result is printed as output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.
