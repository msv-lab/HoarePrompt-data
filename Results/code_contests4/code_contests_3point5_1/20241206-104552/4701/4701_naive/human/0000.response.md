Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input maze grid, the starting and ending positions, and uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the minimum number of moves needed to reach the destination. The program considers both types of moves allowed by the magician and handles the constraints provided in the problem description. The code also correctly outputs the minimum number of times the magician needs to use magic or -1 if the destination is unreachable. Since the program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description, it is correct.
