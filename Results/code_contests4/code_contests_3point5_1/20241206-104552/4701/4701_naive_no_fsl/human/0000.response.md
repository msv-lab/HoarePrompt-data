Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of times the magician needs to use the magic to reach the destination point. It considers all possible moves A and B to navigate through the maze and calculates the minimum number of steps required. The program also handles cases where the magician cannot reach the destination point and correctly outputs -1 in such cases. The program iterates through all possible moves and updates the minimum steps needed to reach the destination point. The code structure and logic seem to align with the problem description, and based on the provided examples, the program produces the correct output.
