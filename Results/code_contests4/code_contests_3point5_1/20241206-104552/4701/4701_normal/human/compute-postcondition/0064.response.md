Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `dy`. The value of `j` can be any integer within the range of -2 to 2. The list `dy` now contains the appended value of `j`. The values of `i` and `dx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -2 to 2 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -2 to 2 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`**
