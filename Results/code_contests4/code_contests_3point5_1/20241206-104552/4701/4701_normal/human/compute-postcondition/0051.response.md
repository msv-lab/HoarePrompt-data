Postcondition: ***For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be within the range from -1 to 3. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is appended to the list `dx` and `j` is appended to the list `dy`. If abs(i) + abs(j) is greater than 1, `vvs` has 1 appended to it; otherwise, 0 is appended to `vvs`.***
