According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. If these lists have the same length, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` have the same length. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the lengths of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` should still be the same.

State: **After the execution of the if else block, the values of `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, if `pu` is equal to `goal`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, for the loop to execute `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` have the same length, `x` and `y` are updated to the sum of `ux` and `xx` and the sum of `uy` and `yy` respectively, `u` is the result of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, the values of `x` and `y` are either negative, greater than or equal to `h`, greater than or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', and if `(seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num)` holds true, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`.**
