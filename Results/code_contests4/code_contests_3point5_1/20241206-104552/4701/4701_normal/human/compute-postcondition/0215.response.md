Example Answer:
The value of `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`. The values of `u` and `num` are dependent on the initial state. If any of the conditions for the program to remain unchanged are met, the program remains in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If the conditions are not met, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If the conditions are not met, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`**
