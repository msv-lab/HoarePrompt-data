Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum` + `vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are unknown, so the exact value of `num` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of the calculation based on the updated values of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the sum of `ux` and `xx`, and `y` is the sum of `uy` and `yy`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of the calculation based on the updated values of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the sum of `ux` and `xx`, and `y` is the sum of `uy` and `yy`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
