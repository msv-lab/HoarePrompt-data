Postcondition: ***`i` is in the range of -1 to 4, `j` is 3, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j for the next iteration with 1 appended if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1. Otherwise, `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j for the next iteration, 0 is appended. This is the state of the program after the if else block is executed.***
