Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` are adjusted such that `q` is still truthy for the loop to execute again. If `pu` is equal to `goal`, `u` is assigned the value of `x` multiplied by `w` added to `y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum` plus `vv`. Additionally, either `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater or equal to `h` or `y` is greater or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'.***
