Example Answer: 
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, but the values of `pnum` and `vv` are not given in the initial state. However, `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, so the output state is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
