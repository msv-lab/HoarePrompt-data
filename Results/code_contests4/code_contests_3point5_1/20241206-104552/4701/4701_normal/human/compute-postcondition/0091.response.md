Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is -2, `dx` contains all the appended values of `i`, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, `vvs` is adjusted based on `i` and `j` values, and the condition `(not i == j == 0)` is true. Additionally, the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1***
