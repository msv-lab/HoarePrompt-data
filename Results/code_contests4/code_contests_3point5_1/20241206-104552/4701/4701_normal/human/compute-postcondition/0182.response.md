Postcondition: ***If `x` < 0 or `y` < 0 or `x` >= `h` or `y` >= `w` or `ss[x][y]` == '#', the program state is determined by the initial values of `pnum` and `vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` > `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num` and the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple containing the values of `num` and `u`.***
