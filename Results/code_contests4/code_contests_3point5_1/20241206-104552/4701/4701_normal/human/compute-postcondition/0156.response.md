Example Answer:
The value of `u` is calculated based on the values of `x`, `w`, and `y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `u`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations.
Output State: **`dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations**
