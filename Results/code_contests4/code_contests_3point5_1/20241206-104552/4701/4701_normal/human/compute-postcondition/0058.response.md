Postcondition: ***`i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, then if `j` is within the range from -1 to 3, `j` is appended to `dy`. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, 1 is appended to `vvs`. If abs(i) + abs(j) <= 1, 0 is appended to `vvs`. After the execution, `j` is updated to the current value of `j` + 1 to be used in the loop.***
