Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. Since `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, the value of `i` is added to the list `dx`. The value of `j` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -2 to 2 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -2 to 2 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`**
