According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is within the range of -2 to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -2 to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be within the range of -2 to 2 with the next value. Additionally, based on the conditions provided, if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` should have appended the value 1, and if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` should contain an appended value of 0. 
State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. `dx` contains the appended value of `i`. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` has appended the value 1. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` contains an appended value of 0.**
