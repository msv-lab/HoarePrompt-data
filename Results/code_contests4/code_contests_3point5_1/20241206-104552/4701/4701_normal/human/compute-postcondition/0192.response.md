Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum` plus `vv`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Adjustments needed in variables `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` to maintain `q` truthy for the loop to execute again if `pu` is equal to `goal`, `u` is assigned the value of `x` multiplied by `w` added to `y`; `num` is assigned the value of `pnum` plus `vv`.
