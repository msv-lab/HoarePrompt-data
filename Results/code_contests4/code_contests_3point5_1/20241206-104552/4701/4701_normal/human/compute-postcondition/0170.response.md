Postcondition: ***Variables `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations and conditions provided, Lists `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are used for the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is less than 0 or `y` is less than 0 or `x` is greater than or equal to `h` or `y` is greater than or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program updates `x` and `y` based on the conditions and calculations provided, and the lists `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are prepared for the next iteration of the loop.***
