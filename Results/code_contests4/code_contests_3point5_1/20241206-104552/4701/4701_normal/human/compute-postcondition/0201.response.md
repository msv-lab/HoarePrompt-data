Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are updated to `ux + xx` and `uy + yy` respectively. The previous values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are unknown, so the updated values of `x` and `y` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: Adjustments are made to `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` such that `q` remains truthy for the loop to execute again, if `pu` is equal to `goal`, `u` is set to the result of `x * w + y` and `num` is set to `pnum + vv`, conditions for `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `ss`, `seen` are checked, and `hp` function is called.
