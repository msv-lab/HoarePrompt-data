Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `dy`. The current value of `j` is unknown, but it should be within the range from -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is potentially appended to `dy` if it is within the range from -1 to 3.
Output State: **`j` is potentially appended to `dy` if it is within the range from -1 to 3**
