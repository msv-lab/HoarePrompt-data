Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -2 to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. `dx` contains the appended value of `i`. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` has appended the value 1. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` contains an appended value of 0.***
