Example Answer:
`hp(q, (num, u))` is called with the parameters `q` and a tuple containing the values of `num` and `u`. The values of `num` and `u` are already calculated based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` and `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv` and `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`**
