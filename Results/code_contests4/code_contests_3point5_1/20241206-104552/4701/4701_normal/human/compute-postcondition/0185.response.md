Example Answer:
`pnum, pu` are assigned the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`. The values of `pnum` and `pu` depend on the input `q`. To ensure `q` remains truthy for the loop to execute again, the states of variables `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, and the outcome of the function `hp` need to be adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: adjustments needed in variables `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` to maintain `q` truthy for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **adjustments needed in variables `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` to maintain `q` truthy for the loop to execute again**
