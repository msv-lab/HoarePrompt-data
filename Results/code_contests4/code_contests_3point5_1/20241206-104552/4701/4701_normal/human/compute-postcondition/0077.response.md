Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`. If `i` and `j` are not both zero, `vvs` will contain 1 appended to it if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `vvs` remains unchanged.***
