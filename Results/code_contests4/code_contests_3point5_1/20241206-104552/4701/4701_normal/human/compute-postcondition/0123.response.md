Postcondition: ***`pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, if `pu` is equal to `goal`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, for the loop to execute `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` have the same length, `x` and `y` are updated to the sum of `ux` and `xx` and the sum of `uy` and `yy` respectively, `u` is the result of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. The values of `x` and `y` are either negative, greater than or equal to `h`, greater than or equal to `w` or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'.***
