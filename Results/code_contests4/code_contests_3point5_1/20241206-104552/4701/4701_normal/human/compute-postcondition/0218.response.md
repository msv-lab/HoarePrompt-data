Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of variables `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` are such that `q` remains truthy for the loop to execute again. If `pu` is equal to `goal`, `u` is set to the result of `x * w + y` and `num` is set to `pnum + vv`. Furthermore, the conditions are checked: either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'. If `seen[u]` is `None` or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num` and `hp` function is called with arguments `q` and `(num, u)`.**
