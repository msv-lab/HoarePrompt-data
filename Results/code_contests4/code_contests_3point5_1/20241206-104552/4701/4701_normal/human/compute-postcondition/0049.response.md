Example Answer: 
`0` is appended to the list `vvs`. The values of `j`, `i`, `dx`, and `dy` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is within the range from -1 to 3; `i` is appended to the list `dx`; `dy` has the value of `j` appended to it; `0` is appended to the list `vvs`.
Output State: **`j` is within the range from -1 to 3; `i` is appended to the list `dx`; `dy` has the value of `j` appended to it; `0` is appended to the list `vvs`**
