Example Answer:
The value 1 is appended to the list `vvs`. Since the initial state of `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j` for the next iteration, the new value of `vvs` will include 1 in addition to the previous values. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is 3, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j for the next iteration with 1 appended.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is 3, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j for the next iteration with 1 appended**
