Example Answer:
The function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`. The values of `num` and `u` are assigned to the tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`, the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`.
Output State: **`seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`, the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`**
