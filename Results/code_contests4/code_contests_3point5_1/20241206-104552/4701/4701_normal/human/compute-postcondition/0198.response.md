Example Answer:
The function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`. The initial state tells us that `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`. Therefore, the tuple passed to the function contains the value of `seen[u]` as the first element. The output state is: `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`, `hp` function is called with arguments `q` and `(num, u)`.
Output State: **`seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`, `hp` function is called with arguments `q` and `(num, u)`**
