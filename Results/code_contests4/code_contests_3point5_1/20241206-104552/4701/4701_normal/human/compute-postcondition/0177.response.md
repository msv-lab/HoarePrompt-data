Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`, where `pnum` is the previous value of `num` and `vv` is a variable. The output state depends on the initial values of `pnum` and `vv`. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `pnum` and `vv`.**
