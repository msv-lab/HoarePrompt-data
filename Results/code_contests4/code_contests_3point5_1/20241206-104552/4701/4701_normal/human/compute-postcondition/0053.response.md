Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the list `dx`, so the value of `i` will be added to the end of the list `dx`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` will be updated to the current value of `j` + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be within the range from -1 to 3, `i` is appended to `dx` and `j` may be appended to `dy` based on the conditions, and either 1 or 0 may be appended to `vvs`.
Output State: **`j` will be updated to the current value of `j` + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be within the range from -1 to 3, `i` is appended to `dx` and `j` may be appended to `dy` based on the conditions, and either 1 or 0 may be appended to `vvs`**
