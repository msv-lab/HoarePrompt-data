According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is within the range of -1 to 3. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. `dx` contains the appended value of `i`. If `i` and `j` are not both zero, `vvs` will contain 1 appended to it if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `vvs` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` may contain 1 appended to it based on the conditions provided**
