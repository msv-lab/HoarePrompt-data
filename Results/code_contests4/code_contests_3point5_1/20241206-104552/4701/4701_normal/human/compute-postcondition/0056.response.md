Example Answer:
The code snippet `vvs.append(0)` appends the value 0 to the list `vvs`. The variables `j` and `dy` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is potentially appended to `dy` if it is within the range from -1 to 3, `vvs` contains the value 0.
Output State: **`j` is potentially appended to `dy` if it is within the range from -1 to 3, `vvs` contains the value 0**
