Output State: **`i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, then for each combination of `i` and `j` within the ranges from -2 to 2 and -1 to 3 respectively, `dx` will contain the value of `i`, `dy` will contain the value of `j`, and `vvs` will contain 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, and 0 otherwise.**
