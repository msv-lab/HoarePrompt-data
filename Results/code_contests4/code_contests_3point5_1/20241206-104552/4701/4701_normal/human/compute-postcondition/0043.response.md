Postcondition: ***`ch`, `cw`, `dh`, `dw` are decreased by 1, `rows` is a positive integer, `cols` is 0 or a positive integer, `ns` is a defaultdict with an empty set, `ss` is a list where each element is an input string from the loop execution, `n` is the product of `rows` and `cols`, `start` is the result of the calculation `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is the result of the calculation `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list with `n` elements initialized to `None`, `seen[start]` is assigned the value `0`, `q` is a list with a tuple containing `(0, start)`, `dx` is a list containing the value of `i`, `dy` is a list containing the value of `j`, `vvs` is a list containing the value 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, and 0 otherwise. For the loop to execute, the values of `i` need to be within the range from -2 to 2, and `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0.***
