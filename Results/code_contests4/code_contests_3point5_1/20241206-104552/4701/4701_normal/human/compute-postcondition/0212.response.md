Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are unknown, so the output state is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv**
