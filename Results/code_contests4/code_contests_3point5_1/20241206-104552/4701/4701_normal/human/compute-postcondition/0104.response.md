According to the code, the loop can execute for each value of `j` within the range -2 to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is 2, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, `vvs` contains the appended values 1 or 0 based on the conditions.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- `j` needs to be updated to 3 to move to the next iteration.
- `dx` should contain all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value after the iteration.
- `vvs` should be updated based on the new values of `i` and `j` for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is 3, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j for the next iteration**
