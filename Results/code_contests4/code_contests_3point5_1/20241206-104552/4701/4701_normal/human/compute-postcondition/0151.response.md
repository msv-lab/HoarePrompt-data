Example Answer:
The values of `pu` is divided by `w` and the quotient is assigned to `ux` and the remainder is assigned to `uy`. The previous values of `pu` and `w` are unknown, so the output state is: `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, `seen[u]` may be assigned the value of `num`, conditions for `x`, `y`, and `ss[x][y]` are checked but may not affect the variables, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`.
Output State: **`pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, `seen[u]` may be assigned the value of `num`, conditions for `x`, `y`, and `ss[x][y]` are checked but may not affect the variables, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`**
