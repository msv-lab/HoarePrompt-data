Postcondition: ***`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `u` retains its previous value of `x * w + y` and `num` retains its previous value of `pnum + vv`. If any of the conditions `x < 0`, `y < 0`, `x >= h`, `y >= w`, or `ss[x][y] == '#'` are true, then no changes are made to `u` or `num`.***
