Example Answer: 
The variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the sum of `ux` and `xx` and the sum of `uy` and `yy` respectively. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `u` will be calculated based on the updated values of `x` and `y` which are the sum of `ux` and `xx`, and the sum of `uy` and `yy` respectively.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of the calculation based on the updated values of `x` and `y`, where `x` is the sum of `ux` and `xx`, and `y` is the sum of `uy` and `yy`**
