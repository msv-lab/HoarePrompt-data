Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. Since `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, the list `dx` now contains the appended value of `i`. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` remains unchanged**
