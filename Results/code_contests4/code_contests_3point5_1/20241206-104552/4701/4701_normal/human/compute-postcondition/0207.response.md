Example Answer: 
The function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`. The variables `num` and `u` retain their previous values, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` retains its previous value of `x * w + y`, `num` retains its previous value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`u` retains its previous value of `x * w + y`, `num` retains its previous value of `pnum + vv`**
