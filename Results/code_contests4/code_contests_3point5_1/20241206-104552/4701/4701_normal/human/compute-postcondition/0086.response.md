According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of -2 to 2 for the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of -1 to 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means it will be within the range of -1 to 4.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is within the range of -1 to 3. `dx` contains all the appended values of `i`, `dy` contains all the appended values of `j`, and `vvs` contains 1 if the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1; otherwise, it contains 0.**
