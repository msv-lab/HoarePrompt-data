Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, then `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` may contain 1 or one more appended to it based on the conditions provided. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dy` contains the appended value of `j`. Otherwise, `vvs` contains 0.***
