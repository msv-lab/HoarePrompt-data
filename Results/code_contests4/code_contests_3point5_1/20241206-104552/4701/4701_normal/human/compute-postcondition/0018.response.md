According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `rows`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `rows` is greater than 0. Since `i` increases by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `rows` should still be greater than 1 after decreasing `i` by 1.
State: **`ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is a new variable with a value greater than 1, `cols` is a new variable with a value greater than 0, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict with an empty set, `ss` is a list where the element at index `i` is now the input string, `i` is 0, `s` is assigned the input string**
