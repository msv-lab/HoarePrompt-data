Example Answer: 
The function `hp` is called with arguments `(q, (num, u))`. The value of `num` is calculated based on conditions involving `x`, `y`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w`, and `ss`. The value of `u` is assigned based on calculations involving `x` and `y`. After the function call, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value based on calculations involving `x` and `y`, `num` is assigned the value based on conditions involving `x`, `y`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w`, and `ss`, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value based on calculations involving `x` and `y`, `num` is assigned the value based on conditions involving `x`, `y`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w`, and `ss`, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`**
