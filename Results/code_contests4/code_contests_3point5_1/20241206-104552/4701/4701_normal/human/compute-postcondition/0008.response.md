Example Answer:
`dh` is decreased by 1, but the previous value of `dh` is unknown. The values of `ch`, `cw`, and `dw` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` remains the same.
Output State: **`ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` remains the same**
