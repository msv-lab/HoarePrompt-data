Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement will skip the remaining code in the loop and continue to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the program will not be affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
