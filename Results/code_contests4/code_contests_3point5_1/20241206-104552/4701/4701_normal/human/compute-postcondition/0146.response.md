Example Answer:
The function hp is called with arguments q and a tuple containing num and u. The value of seen[u] is assigned the value of num. The values of q, num, and u are not provided in the initial state, so their values are unknown after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: seen[u] is assigned the value of num, values of q, num, and u are unknown.
Output State: **seen[u] is assigned the value of num, values of q, num, and u are unknown**
