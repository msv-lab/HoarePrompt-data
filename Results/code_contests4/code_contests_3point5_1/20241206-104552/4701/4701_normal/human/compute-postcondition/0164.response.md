Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `vvs` are non-empty lists; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations. If any of the conditions (`x` less than 0, `y` less than 0, `x` greater than or equal to `h`, `y` greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#') are met, then `x` and `y` are updated accordingly. Additionally, if `seen[u]` is either `None` or greater than `num`, the program enters the if condition and updates `x` and `y` based on those conditions. The state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block is determined by the updates made to `x` and `y` based on the conditions specified in the if part.***
