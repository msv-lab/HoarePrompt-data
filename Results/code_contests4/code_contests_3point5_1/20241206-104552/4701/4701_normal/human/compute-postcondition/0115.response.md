Example Answer: 
`pu` is divided by `w` and the quotient and remainder are assigned to `ux` and `uy` respectively. The previous value of `pu` is assigned by the function `hpp(q)`, and `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop. The values of `ux` and `uy` depend on the result of the division. Therefore, the Output State is: `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`.
Output State: **`pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`**
