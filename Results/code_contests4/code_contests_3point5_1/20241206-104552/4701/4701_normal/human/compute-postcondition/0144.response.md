Postcondition: ***u, num, ux, xx, uy, yy, pnum, vv, h, w, ss are updated based on certain conditions. seen[u] is assigned the value of num, x is updated based on ux and xx, y is updated based on uy and yy, u is calculated as x * w + y, and num is an updated value based on pnum and vv. If x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#', there is no change in the state of variables and the program continues without any alterations.***
