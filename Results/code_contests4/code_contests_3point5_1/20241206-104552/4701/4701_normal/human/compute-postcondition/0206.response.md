Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned to the key `u` in the dictionary `seen`. The values of `u` and `num` are dependent on certain conditions, so if any of the conditions x < 0, y < 0, x >= h, y >= w, or ss[x][y] == '#' are true, then no changes are made to `u` or `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` retains its previous value of `x * w + y`, `num` retains its previous value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`u` retains its previous value of `x * w + y`, `num` retains its previous value of `pnum + vv`**
