Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, `seen[u]` may be assigned the value of `num`, conditions for `x`, `y`, and `ss[x][y]` are checked but may not affect the variables, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `pu` is equal to `goal`.***
