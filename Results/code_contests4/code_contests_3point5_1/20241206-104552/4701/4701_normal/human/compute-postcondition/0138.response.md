Postcondition: ***`u`, `x`, `y`, `num`, `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, `yy`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w`, `ss` are variables. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` > `num`, then `u` is updated based on `x` and `y`, `num` is updated based on conditions involving `x`, `y`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w`, and `ss`, and `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`.***
