Example Answer:
The variables `rows` and `cols` are assigned the values of `h` and `w` respectively. Since `h` and `w` are not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume they are new variables with unknown values. Therefore, the Output State is: `ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is a new variable with an unknown value, `cols` is a new variable with an unknown value.
Output State: **`ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is a new variable with an unknown value, `cols` is a new variable with an unknown value**
