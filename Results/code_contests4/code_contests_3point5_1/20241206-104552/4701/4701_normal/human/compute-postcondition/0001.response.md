Example Answer:
The `sys.setrecursionlimit` function is called with the argument `max(1000, 10 ** 9)`. This sets the maximum recursion depth limit to the maximum value between 1000 and 10 to the power of 9, which is 1000000000. This ensures that the recursion depth limit is at least 1000000000. Since no variables are affected, the Output State is: No variables are affected, recursion depth limit is set to at least 1000000000.
Output State: **No variables are affected, recursion depth limit is set to at least 1000000000**
