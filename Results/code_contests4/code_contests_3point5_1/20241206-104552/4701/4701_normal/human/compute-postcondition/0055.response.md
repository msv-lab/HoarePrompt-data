Example Answer:
Since there is no mention of `j` in the code snippet provided, the variable `j` remains unchanged. The code snippet appends 1 to the list `vvs`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is potentially appended to `dy` if it is within the range from -1 to 3, `vvs` contains 1.
Output State: **`j` is potentially appended to `dy` if it is within the range from -1 to 3, `vvs` contains 1**
