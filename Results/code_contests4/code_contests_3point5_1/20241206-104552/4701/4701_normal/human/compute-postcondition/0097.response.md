According to the code, the loop can execute for the next iteration if `j` is within the range of -2 to 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be within the range of -1 to 3, and `vvs` needs to be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned.

State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is -1, `dx` contains all the appended values of `i`, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, `vvs` is adjusted based on `i` and `j` values, and the condition `(not i == j == 0)` is true. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, then `vvs` contains the appended value 1. Otherwise, `vvs` contains the appended value 0.**
