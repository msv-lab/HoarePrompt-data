According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is within the range of -2 to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the range of -2 to 2. Additionally, since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop, we need to ensure that it is within the range of -1 to 3.

State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -2 to 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
