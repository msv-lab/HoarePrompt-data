Postcondition: ***`pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`. Additionally, if `pu` is equal to `goal`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
