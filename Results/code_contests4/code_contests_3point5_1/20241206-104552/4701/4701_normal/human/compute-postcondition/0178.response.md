Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop without executing any remaining code in the loop. Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot determine the specific impact on variables. Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the initial values of `pnum` and `vv`.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `pnum` and `vv`**
