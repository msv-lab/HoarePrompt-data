Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv**
