Example Answer:
The value 0 is appended to the list `vvs`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` contains 0, `dy` contains the appended value of `j`.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` contains 0, `dy` contains the appended value of `j`**
