Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is:  `pnum` and `pu` are updated based on the function `hpp(q)`, `seen[u]` may be assigned the value of `num`, conditions for `x`, `y`, and `ss[x][y]` are checked but may not affect the variables, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
