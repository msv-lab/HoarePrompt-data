Example Answer:
The value 0 is appended to the list `vvs`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is 3, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j for the next iteration, 0 is appended.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is 3, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, `vvs` contains the updated values based on the new values of `i` and `j for the next iteration, 0 is appended**
