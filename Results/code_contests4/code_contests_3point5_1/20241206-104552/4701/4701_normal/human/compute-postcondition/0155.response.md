Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned the sum of `ux` and `xx`, and `uy` and `yy` respectively. The previous values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists, for the loop to execute; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations.
Output State: **`dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists, for the loop to execute; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations**
