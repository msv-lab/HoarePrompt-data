According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. The loop will execute if these lists are not empty. Before the loop starts, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` need to be non-empty for the loop to execute.
State: **`dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists, for the loop to execute**
