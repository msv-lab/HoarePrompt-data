Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `x`, and `uy` and `yy` to `y` respectively. The values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy` are unknown in the initial state, so the new values of `x` and `y` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: Adjustments needed in variables `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` to maintain `q` truthy for the loop to execute again if `pu` is equal to `goal`.
Output State: **Adjustments needed in variables `dx`, `dy`, `vvs`, `x`, `y`, `u`, `num`, `seen`, `ss`, `hp` to maintain `q` truthy for the loop to execute again if `pu` is equal to `goal`**
