Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. The values of `pnum` and `vv` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations.
Output State: **`dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are non-empty lists; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations**
