Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`. Lists `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are prepared for the next iteration of the loop. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num` and the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`.**
