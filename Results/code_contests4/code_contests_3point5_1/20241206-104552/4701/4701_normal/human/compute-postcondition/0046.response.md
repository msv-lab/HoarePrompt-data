Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the list `dx`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be within the range from -1 to 3, and `i` is appended to the list `dx`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be within the range from -1 to 3, `i` is appended to the list `dx`**
