Example Answer:
The function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple containing the values of `num` and `u`. The values of `num` and `u` are assigned to the corresponding elements of the tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple containing the values of `num` and `u`.
Output State: **`seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, and the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple containing the values of `num` and `u`**
