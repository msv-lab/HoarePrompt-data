According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. If all three lists have the same length, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
- `pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`
- `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop
- `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`
- If `pu` is equal to `goal`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

State: **`pnum` and `pu` are assigned values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `q` remains True after all iterations of the loop, `ux` and `uy` are the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w`, if `pu` is equal to `goal`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, for the loop to execute `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` have the same length**
