Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `vvs` are updated based on the calculations and conditions provided. Lists `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are prepared for the next iteration of the loop. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, then `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num` and the function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`.***
