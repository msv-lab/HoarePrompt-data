Example Answer:
The value 1 is appended to the list `vvs`. The condition `(not i == j == 0)` is true, and the absolute value of `i` (within the range of -1 to 4) plus the absolute value of `j` (-1) is greater than 1, so `vvs` contains the appended values 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is -1, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, `vvs` contains the appended values 1.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 4, `j` is -1, `dx` contains all the previous appended values of `i` along with the new value, `dy` contains -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, `vvs` contains the appended values 1**
