According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rows`. If `rows` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `rows` and `cols` are unknown, so they need to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. Additionally, `i` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is a new variable with a value greater than 0, `cols` is a new variable with a value greater than 0, `OK` is assigned the value '.', `NG` is assigned the value '#', `ns` is a defaultdict with an empty set, `ss` is a list of `None` values with a length of `rows`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `rows` is greater than 0**
