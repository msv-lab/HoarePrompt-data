Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value `pnum + vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are unknown, so the output state is: variables `u`, `num`, `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, `yy`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w`, `ss` are updated based on the conditions, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, `x` is updated based on `ux` and `xx`, `y` is updated based on `uy` and `yy`, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, and `num` is an updated value based on `pnum` and `vv`.
Output State: **`u`, `num`, `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, `yy`, `pnum`, `vv`, `h`, `w`, `ss` are updated based on the conditions, `seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`, `x` is updated based on `ux` and `xx`, `y` is updated based on `uy` and `yy`, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, and `num` is an updated value based on `pnum` and `vv`**
