According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the values of `j` are within the range from -2 to 2. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `ch` is decreased by 1
- `cw` is decreased by 1
- `dh` is decreased by 1
- `dw` is decreased by 1
- `rows` is a positive integer
- `cols` is 0 or a positive integer
- `ns` is a defaultdict with an empty set
- `ss` is a list where each element is an input string from the loop execution
- `n` is the product of `rows` and `cols`
- `start` is the result of the calculation `ch * w + cw`
- `goal` is the result of the calculation `dh * w + dw`
- `seen` is a list with `n` elements initialized to `None`
- `seen[start]` is assigned the value `0`
- `q` is a list with a tuple containing `(0, start)`
- `dx` is an empty list
- `dy` is an empty list
- `vvs` is an empty list

State: **`ch` is decreased by 1, `cw` is decreased by 1, `dh` is decreased by 1, `dw` is decreased by 1, `rows` is a positive integer, `cols` is 0 or a positive integer, `ns` is a defaultdict with an empty set, `ss` is a list where each element is an input string from the loop execution, `n` is the product of `rows` and `cols`, `start` is the result of the calculation `ch * w + cw`, `goal` is the result of the calculation `dh * w + dw`, `seen` is a list with `n` elements initialized to `None`, `seen[start]` is assigned the value `0`, `q` is a list with a tuple containing `(0, start)`, `dx` is an empty list, `dy` is an empty list, `vvs` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the values of `i` need to be within the range from -2 to 2**
