Example Answer:
`dh` and `dw` are assigned the integer values obtained by mapping the input values using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is split by space, converted to integers, and assigned to `dh` and `dw`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ch` and `cw` are assigned the values obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `dh` and `dw` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input.
Output State: **`ch` and `cw` are assigned the values obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `dh` and `dw` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input**
