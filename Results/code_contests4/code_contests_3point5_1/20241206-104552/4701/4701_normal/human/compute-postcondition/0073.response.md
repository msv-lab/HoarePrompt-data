Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`. The range of `j` is -1 to 3, so `j` can be any value within that range. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`i` is within the range of -1 to 3, `j` is the next value within the range of -1 to 3 for the loop to execute one more time, `dx` contains the appended value of `i`, `vvs` remains unchanged**
