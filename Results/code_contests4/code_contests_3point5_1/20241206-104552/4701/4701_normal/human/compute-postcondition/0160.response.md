Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `vvs` are non-empty lists; `x` and `y` are updated based on the calculations. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program executes the corresponding update on `x` and `y` based on the conditions.***
