#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input data and performs a search algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal point in a grid represented by a matrix of characters. It then prints the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal point from the starting point. If a valid path does not exist, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
