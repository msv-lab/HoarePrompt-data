Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input data and uses a search algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal point in a grid represented by a matrix of characters. It then prints the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal point from the starting point. The code correctly handles the two types of moves the magician can make - Move A and Move B. It considers both vertically or horizontally adjacent squares and the 5x5 area centered at the current square for the magician's movements. The code also correctly checks for walls and roads in the maze grid. Additionally, the code appropriately prints -1 if a valid path to the goal point does not exist. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
