You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A maze is composed of a grid of H \times W squares - H vertical, W horizontal.

The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left - (i,j) - is a wall if S_{ij} is `#` and a road if S_{ij} is `.`.

There is a magician in (C_h,C_w). He can do the following two kinds of moves:

* Move A: Walk to a road square that is vertically or horizontally adjacent to the square he is currently in.
* Move B: Use magic to warp himself to a road square in the 5\times 5 area centered at the square he is currently in.



In either case, he cannot go out of the maze.

At least how many times does he need to use the magic to reach (D_h, D_w)?

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 10^3
* 1 \leq C_h,D_h \leq H
* 1 \leq C_w,D_w \leq W
* S_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* S_{C_h C_w} and S_{D_h D_w} are `.`.
* (C_h,C_w) \neq (D_h,D_w)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
C_h C_w
D_h D_w
S_{11}\ldots S_{1W}
\vdots
S_{H1}\ldots S_{HW}


Output

Print the minimum number of times the magician needs to use the magic. If he cannot reach (D_h,D_w), print `-1` instead.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- H and W are integers such that 1 <= H,W <= 10^3.
- C_h, D_h, C_w, and D_w are integers such that 1 <= C_h, D_h <= H and 1 <= C_w, D_w <= W.
- S_{ij} is either '#' or '.'.
- S_{C_h C_w} and S_{D_h D_w} are '.'.
- (C_h, C_w) is not equal to (D_h, D_w).

If `val` is None, then the value at index `goal` in the list `seen` remains unchanged. If `val` is not None, then the value at index `goal` in the list `seen` is printed.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
