Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input data, initializes the necessary variables, performs a search algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal point in a grid of characters, and then prints the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal point from the starting point. If a valid path does not exist, it prints -1. The program follows the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.
