Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input, processes the maze, and finds the minimum number of times the magician needs to use magic to reach the destination point. The program uses a breadth-first search algorithm with a priority queue to efficiently explore the maze and find the shortest path.

The program handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description and correctly outputs the minimum number of magic uses required to reach the destination point. It also accounts for the cases where the destination point is unreachable by outputting -1.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible cases.
