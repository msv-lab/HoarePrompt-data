Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph harmonious. It loops through the nodes, finds connected components, and keeps track of the minimum and maximum nodes in each component. Then, it checks if the current component overlaps with the previous one and increments the answer accordingly. The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
