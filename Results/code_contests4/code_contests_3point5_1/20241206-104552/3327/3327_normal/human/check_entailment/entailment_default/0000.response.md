Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly identifies the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph harmonious. It does so by creating a list `arr` of tuples where each tuple represents a connected component in the graph. It then iterates through the list and checks if the next component overlaps with the previous one, incrementing the answer variable `ans` accordingly. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code agrees with the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, verifying the correctness of the program.
