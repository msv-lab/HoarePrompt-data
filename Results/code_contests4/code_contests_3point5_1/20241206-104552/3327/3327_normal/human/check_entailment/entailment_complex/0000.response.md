Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the problem description, it can be observed that the program correctly addresses the requirements of the problem. The program reads the input values for n, m, u_i, and v_i, constructs a graph based on the edges provided, and then determines the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph harmonious. The functions defined in the program handle the input parsing and output formatting appropriately, and the logic implemented in the main part of the code aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the annotations in the code do not suggest any potential cases where the program may fail to meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program can be considered correct.
