The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two integers `u_i` and `v_i` such that 1 <= `u_i`, `v_i` <= n and `u_i` â‰  `v_i`. The function then prints the elements of the tuples separated by a space. No specific output is returned from the function.
