Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input values, calculates the minimum number of clones required based on the percentage needed for the demonstration, and then outputs the result. It correctly handles the case when the number of clones required is not an integer by checking if the result has a decimal part (y % 1 == 0) and adjusting the output accordingly. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
