Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values and calculates the minimum number of clones needed to ensure that the demonstration involves no less than y percent of the city people. It correctly calculates the number of clones needed based on the problem description where the city will be considered to consist of only n people (not including any clone puppets). The program then outputs the minimum number of clones required to meet the condition.

The program follows the problem description by correctly calculating the minimum number of clones needed to ensure that the demonstration involves at least y percent of the city people.
