Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values and calculates the minimum number of clones required for the demonstration to involve no less than y percent of the city people as described in the problem.
- It correctly applies the formula provided in the problem description, which involves multiplying the first and third elements of the input, dividing by 100, and subtracting the second element (number of wizards).
- The code then determines whether the result should be rounded up to the next integer and prints the correct output.
- The code handles cases where the number of clones needed is an integer or requires rounding up to the next integer.
- The output hints also agree with the code by explaining the calculation process and the rounding logic used in the code.
