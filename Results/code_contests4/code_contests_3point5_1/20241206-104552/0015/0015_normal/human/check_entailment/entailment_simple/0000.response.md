Correctness: **True**

The program takes input for the number of citizens in the city, the number of wizards, and the percentage required for the demonstration. It then calculates the minimum number of clones needed to meet the required percentage for the demonstration involving wizards and their clones.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of clones needed by determining the difference between the required percentage of citizens and the number of wizards, then calculates the number of clones needed to bridge that gap. It ensures that the number of clones is an integer by checking if the result is divisible by 1 and adjusts accordingly.

The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
