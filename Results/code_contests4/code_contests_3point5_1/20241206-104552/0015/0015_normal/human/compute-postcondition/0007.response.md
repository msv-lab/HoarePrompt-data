According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `p`. If there are more elements in the list `p`, the loop can iterate one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from `i`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the number of elements in the list `p` must be increased.

State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from `i`; for the loop to execute another time, there must be more elements in `p` to iterate**
