According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If `p` is a non-empty iterable object, the loop can execute. Since `num` is an empty list before the loop starts, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `p` must be a non-empty iterable object.
State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` is an empty list, for the loop to execute `p` is a non-empty iterable object**
