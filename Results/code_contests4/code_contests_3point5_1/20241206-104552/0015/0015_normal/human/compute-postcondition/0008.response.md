Example Answer:
`num` appends the integer value of `i`. The loop is not explicitly shown, but it iterates over elements in `p` to execute another time. The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from `i`; for the loop to execute another time, there must be more elements in `p` to iterate.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from `i`; for the loop to execute another time, there must be more elements in `p` to iterate**
