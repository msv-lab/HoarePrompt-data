Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n**
