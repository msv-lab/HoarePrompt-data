Example Answer:
`num` appends the integer value of `i` to its list. The value of `i` is unknown, but it is converted to an integer using `int()` before being appended. The loop must have more elements in `p` to continue iterating. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from `i`; for the loop to execute another time, there must be more elements in `p` to iterate.
