Example Answer:
The value of `i` is converted to an integer using `int(i)` and then appended to the list `num`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from `i`; `p` is a non-empty iterable object.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from `i`; `p` is a non-empty iterable object**
