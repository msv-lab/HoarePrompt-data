Example Answer:
The value of `y` is calculated based on the values in `num`. The first element of `num` is multiplied by the third element, then divided by 100, and finally subtracted by the second element. The result is assigned to `y`. Since the initial state values of `num[0]`, `num[1]`, and `num[2]` are not given, the final value of `y` cannot be determined explicitly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from all elements in `p`.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from all elements in `p`**
