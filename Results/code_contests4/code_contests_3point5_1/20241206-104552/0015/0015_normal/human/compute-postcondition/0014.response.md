Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the integer value of `y` incremented by 1. Since `y` is an integer and not divisible by 1, the value of `y` remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from all elements in `p`.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` contains the appended integer values from all elements in `p`.**
