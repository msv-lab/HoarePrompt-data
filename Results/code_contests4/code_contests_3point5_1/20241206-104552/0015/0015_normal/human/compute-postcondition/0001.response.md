Example Answer:
The string `c` is split into a list of substrings and stored in variable `p`. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n**
