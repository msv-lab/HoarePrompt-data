Example Answer:
`num` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= n, x, y <= 104 and x <= n; `num` is an empty list**
