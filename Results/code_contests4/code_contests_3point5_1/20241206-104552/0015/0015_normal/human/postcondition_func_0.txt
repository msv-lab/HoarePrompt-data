The function `func` reads input values, calculates a specific formula, and determines whether the result is an integer or requires rounding up to the next integer. It does not accept any parameters. The calculation involves multiplying the first and third elements of the input, dividing by 100, subtracting the second element, and then determining whether the result should be rounded up to the next integer. The function outputs either the integer value of the result or that value plus 1.
