Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code simply prints '3' to the console, which is the expected output based on the problem description. The description does not mention any conditions or logic to be implemented, only the expected output value. Since the code produces the correct output without any deviation, it can be considered correct. The output hints also confirm that the code is expected to print '3' without any additional conditions.
