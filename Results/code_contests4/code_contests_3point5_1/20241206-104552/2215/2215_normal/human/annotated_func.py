#State of the program right berfore the function call: id is an integer such that 0 ≤ id ≤ 10^6.**
def func():
    print('3')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prints '3' to the console. The function does not return any value. The annotation mentioning the description of a person based on `id` is not reflected in the actual code.
