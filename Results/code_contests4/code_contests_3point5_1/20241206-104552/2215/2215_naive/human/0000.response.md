Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program simply prints '3' as the output, indicating that the given document corresponds to subject 3. The problem description does not specify any specific logic or conditions to determine the subject based on the document content or identifier. Since the output is fixed and does not rely on any specific input, the program is correct for all cases.
