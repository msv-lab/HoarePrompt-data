Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the function described in the problem statement. The program seems to be attempting to calculate the sum of all possible combinations of f(a_i, a_j) for the given array a. However, the implementation is incorrect and does not follow the formal definitions of the function f(x, y) provided in the problem description.

The incorrect implementation of the function f within the program leads to incorrect results, making the overall program incorrect. The program does not handle the shuffling of digits as described in the problem statement, which results in incorrect output.

Therefore, based on the incorrect implementation of the function and the mismatch with the problem description, the correctness of the program is **False**.
