Example Answer: 
`us[i]` is assigned the value of `us[i] + ts[x - 1]`. The value of `x` is `zs[i] + 1`, so `x - 1` is `zs[i]`. Since `ts` elements are modified with the first element being incremented by 1, `ts[x - 1]` is the modified value. Therefore, `us[i]` is updated with the sum of the previous value of `us[i]` and the modified value of `ts[x - 1]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`x` is the value of `zs[i] + 1`, elements in `ts` are modified with the first element being incremented by 1, `us` is updated with the sum of previous `us[i]` and modified `ts[x - 1]`, `zs` and `xs` remain unchanged, `i` is -1 for the loop to execute again.**
