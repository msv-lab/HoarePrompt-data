Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list where each element represents the count of items with length equal to the index, `l1` has at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 11, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` contains the final calculated result, `j` is -1. If x <= 11, the value of `ans` is updated with the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. If x > 11, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` is incremented by the product of `arr[10]` and `res`.**
