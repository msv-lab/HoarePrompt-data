Example Answer:
The value of `x` is modified by subtracting the bitwise AND of `x` and the negation of `x` from `x`. This operation effectively removes the rightmost set bit in `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged**
