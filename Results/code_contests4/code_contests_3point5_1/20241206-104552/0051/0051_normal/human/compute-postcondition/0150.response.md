According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 12 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be -1 since the range is from `i - 1` to -1. 
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list, `l1` has at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `l1`, `ans` is updated based on conditions given, `i` is 12, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the formula provided, `j` is -1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `res` is updated based on the calculation of the formula**
