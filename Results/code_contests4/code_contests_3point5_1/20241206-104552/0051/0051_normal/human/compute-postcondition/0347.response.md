Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated based on the formula provided. The values of `item`, `j`, `x`, `i`, and `mod` are used in the calculation. After executing the code, the value of `res` will be modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, `arr` has at least `i` elements, `l1` has at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the formula provided, `j` is within the range of `i - 2` to 0, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, `res` is updated based on the formula provided.
