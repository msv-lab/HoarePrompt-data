Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a_i` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `conv` is either `ord` or a lambda function, `A` contains elements based on the calculation, `numb` is updated based on the calculation, `sign` can be either 1 or -1, `i` is 1, `s` contains the input read from the standard input buffer, for the loop to execute again, no states need adjustment as it is a `while True` loop**
