Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is either 1 or 2, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` contains the cumulative sum calculated by the loop, `j` is either -1 or within the range of `i - (i - 1)` to 0, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, and for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 11. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. If `x` is greater than 1 and `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` is updated based on a formula, and `ans` remains the final calculated value.***
