Example Answer:
The sign multiplied by numb is appended to the list A. The values of sign and numb are 1 and 0 respectively, so the value appended to A is 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, conv is either ord or a lambda function, A contains 0, numb is zero, sign is 1, i is 0, s contains the input read from the standard input buffer.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers, conv is either ord or a lambda function, A contains 0, numb is zero, sign is 1, i is 0, s contains the input read from the standard input buffer**
