Postcondition: ***mod is 998244353, n is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, arr is a list representing the count of items, l1 has at least 2 items, item is the second item in l1, ans is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, i is 12, x is the length of item, res is the calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, j is -1, the element at index i-1 in arr is 0. If x <= i, res remains unchanged. If x > i, res is updated by adding the product of the element at index i - 1 in arr and res.***
