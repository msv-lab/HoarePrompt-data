Output State: `ts` has elements that have been incremented based on the value of `x` during each iteration of the loop. `us` has accumulated the sum of values from `ts` at specific indices. The loop terminates when `x` becomes less than or equal to 0.
`x` has a final value based on the operations within the loop.
