Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is the next value in the range 1 to 10, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final result after the loop has executed, and `j` is adjusted accordingly. If x <= i, `ans` is incremented by the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. If x > i, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`, `i` is 0 or greater, `res` is updated according to the provided formula for all iterations, and `j` is 0.***
