According to the code, the loop will continue running as long as `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`, for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 0**
