According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` goes from `i - 1` to 0 in reverse order. Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute only once. 

Before the loop starts, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to the element at index 0 in `arr` is 0.

State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `arr` is a list where each element represents the count of items with length equal to the index, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated result after all iterations, `j` is equal to the length of `item`, the element at index 0 in `arr` is 0**
