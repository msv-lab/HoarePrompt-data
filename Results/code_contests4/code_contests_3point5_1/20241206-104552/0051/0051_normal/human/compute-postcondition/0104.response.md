Output State: **`x` is updated based on the bitwise operation `x -= x & -x`, elements in `ts` are modified with the first element being incremented by 1, `us` is updated with the sum of previous `us[i]` and modified `ts[x - 1`, `zs` and `xs` remain unchanged, `i` is -1 for the loop to execute again. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
