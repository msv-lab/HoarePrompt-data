According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `j`, `x`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `arr` represents the count of items, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final value, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on a formula, `j` is updated based on the loop, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, `x` is less than or equal to `i`, for the loop to execute `j` starts from `x - 1` and `arr[i-1]` is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` and update `res` based on the formula provided in the code snippet. Additionally, `x` should be less than or equal to `i` and `j` should not go below 0.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `arr` represents the count of items, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final value, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the formula, `j` is updated based on the loop, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, `x` is less than or equal to `i`, for the loop to execute `j` starts from `x - 2` and `arr[i-1]` is 0**.
