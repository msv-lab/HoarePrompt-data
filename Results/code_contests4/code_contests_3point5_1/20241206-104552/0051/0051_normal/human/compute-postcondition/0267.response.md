Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 12, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the updated calculated value, `j` is -1, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, for the loop to execute `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` is updated by adding the product of converting `item[j]` to an integer and raising 10 to the power of `(x - j) * 2 - 1` modulo `mod`.**
