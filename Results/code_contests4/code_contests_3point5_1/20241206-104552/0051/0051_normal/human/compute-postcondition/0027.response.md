Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a_i` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `conv` is either `ord` or a lambda function, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is assigned the value `zero`, `sign` is assigned the value `1`, `i` is 1, `s` contains the input read from the standard input buffer and for the loop to execute again, no states need adjustment as it is a `while True` loop***
