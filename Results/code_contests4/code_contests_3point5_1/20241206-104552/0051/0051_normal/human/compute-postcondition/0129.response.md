Since the loop condition is `while True`, it will continue indefinitely until explicitly broken out of. Given that `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, the loop breaks out without altering the variables. Therefore, to execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing**
