Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1`, where `zs[i]` remains unchanged. Since the value of `x` is incremented by 2, after execution, `x` will be `zs[i] + 3`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited, but the state of `ts` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `zs[i]` remains unchanged, `x` is incremented by 2 to `zs[i] + 3`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State: **`zs[i]` remains unchanged, `x` is incremented by 2 to `zs[i] + 3`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited**
