According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` being 0 ensures the loop will execute. Additionally, the initial value of `j` being either 0 or -1 based on the condition allows the loop to start. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:

State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 11, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is 0, `j` is 0, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, for the loop to execute `x` is greater than or equal to 1**
