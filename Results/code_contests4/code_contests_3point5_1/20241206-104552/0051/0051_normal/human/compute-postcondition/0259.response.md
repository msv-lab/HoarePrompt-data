According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` starts at `x - 1` and goes down to 0 in each iteration.

State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 12, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is 0, `j` is `x - 1`, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, for the loop to execute `x` is greater than or equal to 1**
