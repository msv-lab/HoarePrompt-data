At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list where each element represents the count of items with length equal to the index, `l1` has at least 1 item, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 12, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` contains the final calculated result, `j` is -1**
