Example Answer:
The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged, `us[i]` is updated based on the new value of `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged, `us[i]` is updated based on the new value of `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
