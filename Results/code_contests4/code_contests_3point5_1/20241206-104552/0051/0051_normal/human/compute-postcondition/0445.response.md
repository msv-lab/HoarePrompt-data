Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is in the range 1 to 10, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` contains the final value after all iterations of the loop have executed, and `j` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition. If x <= i, `res` contains the cumulative result of the calculations in the loop. If x > i, `res` contains the product of `arr[i - 1]` and the final value after all iterations of the loop have executed.***
