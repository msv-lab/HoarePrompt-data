According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to the length of `item` which is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `arr` is a list where each element represents the count of items with length equal to the index, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated result after all iterations, `j` is equal to the length of `item` decremented by 1, the element at index 0 in `arr` is 0.**
