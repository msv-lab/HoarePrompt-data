Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 10, for the loop to execute again `x` is the length of `item` - 2 and x is greater than or equal to 11, `res` is the updated value after the calculation, `j` is 1, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 0, `res` is updated by adding 2 times the integer value of `item[j]` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of `(x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1)` modulo `mod`.**
