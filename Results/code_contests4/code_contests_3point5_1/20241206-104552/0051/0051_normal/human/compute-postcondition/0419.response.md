According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `x` is greater than `i`. Right before the loop, `x` is larger than `i` and `x` is decreased by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `i + 2`.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 11, `arr` is a list representing the count of items, `l1` has at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is the next value in the range 1 to 10, `x` is the length of the new `item` and x is greater than `i + 2`, `res` is 0, `j` is 0**
