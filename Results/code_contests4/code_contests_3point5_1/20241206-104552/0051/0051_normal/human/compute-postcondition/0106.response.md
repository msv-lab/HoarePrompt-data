Example Answer:
The value of `us[i]` is incremented by the value of `ts[x - 1]`. The variables `x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, and `i` remain unchanged for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged for the loop to execute again**
