Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute one more time. Therefore, all states remain the same at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a_i` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `conv` is either `ord` or a lambda function, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is updated based on the calculation, `sign` is either 1 or -1, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` contains the input read from the standard input buffer**
