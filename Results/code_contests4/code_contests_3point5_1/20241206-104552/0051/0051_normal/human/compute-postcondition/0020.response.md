Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `a_i` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `conv` is either `ord` or a lambda function, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is updated based on the calculation, `sign` can be either 1 or -1, `i` is 1, `s` contains the input read from the standard input buffer. If s[i] >= b'0'[0], `sign` is either 1 or -1 based on the value of s[i] (1 if s[i] != b'-'[0], -1 if s[i] = b'-'[0]). If s[i] = b'-'[0], `sign` is -1.
