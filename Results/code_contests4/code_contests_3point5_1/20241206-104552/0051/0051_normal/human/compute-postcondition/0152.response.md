Example Answer:
`res` is updated by adding the value of `int(item[j + (x - i)])` multiplied by `10` raised to the power of `(i - j) * 2 - 1` modulo `mod`. The value of `j` is -1, `x` is the length of `item`, `i` is 12, and `mod` is 998244353. The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. 
Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list, `l1` has at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `l1`, `ans` is updated based on conditions given, `i` is 12, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is updated based on the calculation of the formula, `j` is -1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
