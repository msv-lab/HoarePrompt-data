Example Answer:
The value at index `x - 1` in the list `ts` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `x` is 0, so `ts[0]` is incremented by 1. The states of `us` and `zs` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 0, elements in `ts` are modified with the first element being incremented by 1, `us` and `zs` remain the same.
Output State: **`x` is 0, elements in `ts` are modified with the first element being incremented by 1, `us` and `zs` remain the same**
