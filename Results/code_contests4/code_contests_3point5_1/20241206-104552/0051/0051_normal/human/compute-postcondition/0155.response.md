Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list, `l1` has at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `l1`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions given, `i` is 12, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated result or the updated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `j` is -1. If x <= i, then `ans` is updated with the value of `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`. If x > i, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` is incremented by the product of `arr[11]` and `res`.***
