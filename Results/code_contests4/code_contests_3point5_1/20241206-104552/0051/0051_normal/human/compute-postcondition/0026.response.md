Example Answer:
`sign` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `numb` is unknown, but it is initialized as `zero`. Therefore, the Output State is: `numb` is assigned the value `zero`, `sign` is assigned the value `1`.
Output State: **`numb` is assigned the value `zero`, `sign` is assigned the value `1`**
