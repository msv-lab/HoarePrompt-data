Example Answer:
`x` is updated to `zs[i] + 1`, which means its value depends on the value of `zs[i]`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 0. Then, `us[i]` is updated by adding `ts[x - 1]`. The final state depends on the initial values of `zs[i]`, `ts`, and the condition of `x` being greater than 0.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `zs[i]`, `ts`, and the condition of `x` being greater than 0**
