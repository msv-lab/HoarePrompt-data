Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated by performing a bitwise AND operation between `x` and its two's complement (`-x`). Since `x` is 0, the two's complement of 0 is also 0. Therefore, `x` remains 0 after the operation. The values of `ts`, `us`, and `zs[i]` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`x` is 0, `ts` and `us` remain unchanged, `zs[i]` remains the same**
