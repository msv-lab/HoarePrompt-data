Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of `int(item[j + (x - i)])` and `pow(10, (i - j - 1) * 2, mod)` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `res`, `item`, `j`, `x`, `i`, and `mod` are used in this calculation. 
Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `arr` is a list where each element represents the count of items with length equal to the index, `l1` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the updated value after the calculation, `j` is equal to the length of `item` decremented by 1, the element at index 0 in `arr` is 0.**
