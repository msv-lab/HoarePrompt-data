The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n` which is a positive integer, and `a_i` which are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the function body, the program returns the list of integers A after potentially appending a new value based on the conditions mentioned. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept a positive integer n and a list of positive integers a_i, and return the list of integers A after potentially appending a new value based on the conditions specified.
