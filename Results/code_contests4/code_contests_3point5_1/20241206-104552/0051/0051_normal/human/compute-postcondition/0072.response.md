According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely until explicitly broken out of. In this case, the loop breaks out when `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1 again.
State: **`zs[i]` is unchanged, `ts` is unchanged, `x` is incremented by 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement**
