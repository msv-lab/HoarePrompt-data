Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `a_i` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `conv` is either `ord` or a lambda function, `A` contains a new element (positive or negative), `numb` is updated based on the calculation (zero if `s[i] == b'-'[0]`), `sign` is either 1 or -1, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` contains the input read from the standard input buffer.
