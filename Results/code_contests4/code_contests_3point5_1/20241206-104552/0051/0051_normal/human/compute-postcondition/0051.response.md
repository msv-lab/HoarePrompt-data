According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Therefore, the program state needs to be repeated at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **Output State: The element in `ts` at index `x - 1` is incremented by 1. If `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, then the element in `ts` at index `x - 1` is still incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
