Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue indefinitely until there is a break statement or condition within the loop body that stops the execution. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes one more time, no states need to be adjusted. The loop will repeat as is.
State: **`ts` has elements that have been incremented based on the value of `x` during each iteration of the loop, `us` has accumulated the sum of values from `ts` at specific indices, the loop continues until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0, and `x` is still greater than 0**
