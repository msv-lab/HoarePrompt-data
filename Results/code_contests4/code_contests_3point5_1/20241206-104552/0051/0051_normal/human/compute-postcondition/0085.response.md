Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will continue indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop body. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute one more time without any adjustments to the program state.
State: **`x` is 0, elements in `ts` are modified with the first element being incremented by 1, `us` and `zs` remain the same**
