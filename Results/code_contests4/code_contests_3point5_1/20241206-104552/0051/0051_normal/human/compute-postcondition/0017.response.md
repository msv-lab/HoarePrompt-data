Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, conv is either ord or a lambda function; A is an empty list, numb is zero, sign is 1, i is 0, s contains the input read from the standard input buffer. The value of s[i] is less than b'0'[0]. The condition (s[i] == b'-'[0]) is false, sign is 1.***
