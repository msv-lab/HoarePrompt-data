Since the while loop condition is `True`, the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is a break or return statement inside the loop body. Therefore, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`x`, `ts`, `us`, `zs`, `xs`, `i` remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing**
