The function `func_1` initializes some variables, reads an integer and a list of strings as input, processes the input data through complex calculations, and finally prints the result. It doesn't accept any parameters and doesn't have a return value. The function performs multiple nested loops to calculate a final result based on the input data provided. There are potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotations that are not addressed in the summary.
