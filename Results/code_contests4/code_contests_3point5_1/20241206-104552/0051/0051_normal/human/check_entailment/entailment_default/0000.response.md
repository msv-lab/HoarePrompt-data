Correctness: **False**

The code provided for the problem description does not correctly implement the function `func_1` to calculate the sum of all possible combinations of the function `f(a_i, a_j)` modulo 998244353. There are several issues with the code:
1. The code does not correctly handle the case when the input string `s` is empty or the last character of `s` is not a numeric character. This may lead to incorrect calculations.
2. The code does not fully cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are missing edge cases and the implementation is not comprehensive enough to handle all scenarios.

Therefore, based on the initial assessment of the code and its discrepancies with the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed as **False**.
