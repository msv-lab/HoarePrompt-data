Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the sum of f(a_i, a_j) for all pairs of i and j as specified in the problem description. The implementation in `func_1` does not accurately perform the function f(x, y) as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the calculations within the loops are not aligned with the formal definitions provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
