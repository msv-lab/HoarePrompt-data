Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the function f(x, y) as described in the problem statement. The calculations within the nested loops do not accurately alternate digits of the two numbers x and y. This discrepancy results in an incorrect final answer. An example to illustrate this is when the input is [12, 3, 45], the expected output should be 12330, but the code will produce a different result due to the incorrect implementation of the alternating digits. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
