The function `count_next_smaller_elements` accepts a list of integers `xs` and calculates the accumulated sum of values from `ts` at specific indices based on the operations performed within the loops in the function. The function iterates through the elements of `xs` and updates `us` with the accumulated sum. It uses `zs`, `ts`, and `us` as intermediate lists to keep track of indices and values during the calculations. The function returns the final accumulated sum stored in `us` after the loops have finished executing.
