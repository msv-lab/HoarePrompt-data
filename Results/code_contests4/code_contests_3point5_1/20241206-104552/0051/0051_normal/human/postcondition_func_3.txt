The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and positive integers `a_i` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It reads input from the standard input buffer, processes the input string `s`, and extracts a list of integers `A` by following specific conditions. The function returns the list of integers `A` after potentially appending a new value based on the mentioned conditions. However, the code may not handle the case where the input string `s` is empty or the last character of `s` is not a numeric character.
