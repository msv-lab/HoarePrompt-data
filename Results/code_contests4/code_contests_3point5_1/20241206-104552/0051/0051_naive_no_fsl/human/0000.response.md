Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the function f(a, b) as described in the problem statement. The calculation of the function f(a, b) in the program is not in accordance with the formal definitions provided in the problem description. Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the sum of f(a_i, a_j) modulo 998244353 for all elements in the array. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and as a result, the correctness of the program is false.
