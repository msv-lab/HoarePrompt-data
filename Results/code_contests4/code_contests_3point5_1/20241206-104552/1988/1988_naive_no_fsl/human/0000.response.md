Correctness: False

Explanation: The given program only reads the input data but does not implement the logic to determine if the balls can be arranged in the specified manner in both cylinders B and C. The program lacks the necessary logic to check and output "YES" or "NO" based on the arrangement of balls. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
