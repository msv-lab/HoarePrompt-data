Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to the input obtained by splitting the string stored in `raw_input()`. Since `n` contains 10 numbers separated by blanks, after execution, `tmp` will contain a list of 10 integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 1**
