According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `data` is an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is not empty and `i` is 0 to indicate the first iteration.
State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` is not empty, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
