Example Answer:
`tmp` is appended to the `data` list. The values of `n`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 1**
