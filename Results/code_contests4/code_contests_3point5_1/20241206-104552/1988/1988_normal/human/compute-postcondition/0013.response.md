Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input consisting of N datasets, where N is a positive integer. Each dataset contains 10 numbers separated by blanks. The function then processes these datasets by storing them in a list of lists within the `data` variable. The function does not explicitly return any value. It reads the number of datasets, reads the 10 numbers in each dataset, and stores them in a list of lists. **
