Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the result of converting each element of the input string to an integer. The `map` function converts each element to an integer, and `raw_input().split()` extracts the elements separated by blanks. Since the initial state does not specify the actual values in `n`, the output state will be: `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` is not empty, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `tmp` contains the integers extracted from `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` is not empty, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `tmp` contains the integers extracted from `n`**
