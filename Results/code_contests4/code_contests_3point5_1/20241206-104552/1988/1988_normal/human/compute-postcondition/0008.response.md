According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` should still be greater than `i`.
State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
