Example Answer:
`tmp` is appended to the list `data`, `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, and `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
