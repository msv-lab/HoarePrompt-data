Example Answer:
`tmp` contains the integers extracted from `n`, and `data` appends `tmp` to it. The loop executes for the first time when `i` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 0**
