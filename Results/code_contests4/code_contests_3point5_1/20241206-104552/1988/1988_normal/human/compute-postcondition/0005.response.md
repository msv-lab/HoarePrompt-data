According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a string containing 10 numbers separated by blanks, `data` contains `tmp`, `i` is 1**
