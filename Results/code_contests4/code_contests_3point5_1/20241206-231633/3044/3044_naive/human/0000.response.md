Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly initializes an empty list `cur` to keep track of the current directory.
2. It correctly reads the number of commands and processes each command.
3. For the `pwd` command, it correctly prints the absolute path of the current directory by joining the elements in the `cur` list with slashes.
4. For the `cd` command, it correctly handles both absolute and relative paths by checking if the path starts with a slash. If it does, it resets the `cur` list, otherwise, it processes the path relative to the current directory.
5. It correctly handles the ".." pseudo-directory by popping the last element from the `cur` list.
6. The program handles all cases described in the problem statement including changing directories, displaying the current directory path, and navigating to parent directories.
