Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles the commands `cd` and `pwd` as described in the problem. It maintains the current directory path in the `cur` list and updates it accordingly when `cd` commands are encountered. The `pwd` command prints the absolute path of the current directory. The program accounts for both absolute and relative paths, as well as the special `..` directory. The logic provided seems to cover all the cases mentioned in the problem description.
