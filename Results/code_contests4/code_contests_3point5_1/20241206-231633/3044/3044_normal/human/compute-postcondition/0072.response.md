Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the input string from `raw_input()`. If s is equal to 'pwd', the program does nothing. Otherwise, the program adjusts `cur` based on the elements in `s`. If an element is '..', the last element is removed from `cur`. If not, the element is appended to `cur`. `i` is updated accordingly, and `s` remains as '/' after all iterations have finished.***
