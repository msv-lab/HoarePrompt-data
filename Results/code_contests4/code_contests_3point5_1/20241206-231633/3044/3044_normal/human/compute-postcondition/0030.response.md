Example Answer:
The string `s` is split into a list of words, and then the second element (index 1) is assigned back to the variable `s`. The previous value of `s` is a string, so after execution, `s` will now hold the second word of the original string. The variables `cur` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string containing the second word of the original string.
Output State: **`cur` is a list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string containing the second word of the original string**
