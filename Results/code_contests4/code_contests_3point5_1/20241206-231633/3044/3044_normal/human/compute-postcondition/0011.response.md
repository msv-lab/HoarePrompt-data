According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `s` is not equal to 'pwd' and the first character of `s` is '/'. Since `s` is modified to remove the first character during the loop, we need to ensure that `s` still meets the condition for the loop to execute at the end of the loop. Additionally, the loop depends on the elements obtained after splitting `s` by '/'. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one '/' character after removing the first character.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the input value is a non-negative integer, `s` is the second word of the input value as a string, `s` is not equal to 'pwd', the first character of `s` is '/', `s` contains at least one '/' character after removing the first character**
