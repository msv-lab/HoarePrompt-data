Postcondition: ***If the first character of `s` is '/', `cur` becomes an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character. If `x` is equal to '..', `cur` is an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character. Otherwise, `cur` is appended with the value of `x`, `i` remains an integer, and `s` is modified based on the condition.***
