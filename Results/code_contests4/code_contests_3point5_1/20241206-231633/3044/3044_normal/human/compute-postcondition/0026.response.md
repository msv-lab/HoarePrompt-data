Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', '/' is printed followed by joining elements in `cur` list with '/' separator. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', `cur` is updated to contain elements after splitting `s` by '/', `i` is 0, and `s` is the second word of the input value as a string with the first character removed.***
