Example Answer:
The list `cur` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the second element of the input string from `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the second element of the input string from `raw_input()`**
