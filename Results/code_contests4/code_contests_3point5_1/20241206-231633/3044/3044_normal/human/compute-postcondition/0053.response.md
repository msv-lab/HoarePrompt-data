Example Answer:
The `s` variable is reassigned the value of the second element after splitting the input string `s`. The previous values of the variables are `cur` is a list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the input string from `raw_input()`. After execution, `s` will contain the second element of the split string. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the second element of the input string from `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`cur` is a list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the second element of the input string from `raw_input()`**
