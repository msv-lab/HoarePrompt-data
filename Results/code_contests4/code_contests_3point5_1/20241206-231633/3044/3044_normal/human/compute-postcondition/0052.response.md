Example Answer:
The `join` function concatenates all elements in the list `cur` with a '/' separator and then prints it along with a leading '/'. The values of `cur`, `i`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the input string from `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`cur` is a list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is the input string from `raw_input()`**
