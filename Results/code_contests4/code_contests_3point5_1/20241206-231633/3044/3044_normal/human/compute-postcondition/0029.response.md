Example Answer:
The `join` method concatenates all elements of the `cur` list with '/' in between them. The `print` function then prints this concatenated string with a '/' at the beginning. The values of `cur`, `i`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string.
Output State: **`cur` is a list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string**
