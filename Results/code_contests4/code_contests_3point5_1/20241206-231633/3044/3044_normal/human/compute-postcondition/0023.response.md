Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`, which contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s`. If `x` is equal to '..', the last character is removed before appending `x`. The value of `i` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s`, with the last character removed if `x` is equal to '..', or with `x` appended at the end if `x` is not equal to '..', `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s`, with the last character removed if `x` is equal to '..', or with `x` appended at the end if `x` is not equal to '..', `i` remains 0**
