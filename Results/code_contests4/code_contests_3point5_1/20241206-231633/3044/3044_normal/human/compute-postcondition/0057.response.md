According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s` and its elements after splitting. If `s` contains '/' as a delimiter, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the elements that need to be adjusted are `s` to contain '/' as a delimiter, `x` to be the first element after splitting `s`, and `i` to be updated after the increment.
State: **`cur` is a list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is a string containing '/', for the loop to execute `s` should contain '/', `x` is the first element after splitting `s`**
