Example Answer:
If the first character of `s` is '/', then `cur` becomes an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `cur`, `i`, and `s`. The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. 
Output State: **`cur` is appended with the value of `x`, `i` remains an integer, `s` is modified based on the condition**
