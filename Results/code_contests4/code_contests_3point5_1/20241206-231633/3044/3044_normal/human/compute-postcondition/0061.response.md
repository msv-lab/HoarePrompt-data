Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. The value of `x` is the first element after splitting the string `s`, and it is mentioned that the value of `x` is not '..'. Therefore, the list `cur` will have `x` appended to it.
Output State: **`cur` is a list containing the appended value of `x`, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is a string containing '/', for the loop to execute `s` should contain '/'**
