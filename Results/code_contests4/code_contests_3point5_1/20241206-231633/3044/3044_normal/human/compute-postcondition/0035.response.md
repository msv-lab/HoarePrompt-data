Postcondition: ***If the first character of `s` is '/', `cur` becomes an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `cur`, `i`, and `s`, for the loop to execute `s` contains at least one '/'. Additionally, when `x` is equal to '..', the state of the program is such that `cur` is an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character.***
