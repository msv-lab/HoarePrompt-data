Example Answer:
`cur` is a list that contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s`. `i` remains 0. After executing `cur.append(x)`, `x` is added to the end of the list `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s` with `x` appended at the end, `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s` with `x` appended at the end, `i` remains 0**
