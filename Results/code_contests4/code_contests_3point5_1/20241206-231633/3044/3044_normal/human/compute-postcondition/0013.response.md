Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed by using the slicing operation `[:-1]`. Since `cur` is initially an empty list, no elements are removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the input value is a non-negative integer, `s` is the second word of the input value as a string, `s` is not equal to 'pwd', the first character of `s` is '/', `s` contains at least one '/' character after removing the first character, x is equal to '..'.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the input value is a non-negative integer, `s` is the second word of the input value as a string, `s` is not equal to 'pwd', the first character of `s` is '/', `s` contains at least one '/' character after removing the first character, x is equal to '..'**
