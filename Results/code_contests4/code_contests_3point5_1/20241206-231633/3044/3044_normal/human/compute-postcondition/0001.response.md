According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value entered by the user when prompted by the `input()` function. The loop will execute only if the input is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, `cur` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and the input value is a non-negative integer.
State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the input value must be a non-negative integer**
