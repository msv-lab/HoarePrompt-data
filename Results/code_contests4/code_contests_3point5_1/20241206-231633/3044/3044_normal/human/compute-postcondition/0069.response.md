Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `cur`, but the previous values of `cur`, `i`, and `s` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s` and `x`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` contains '/' for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s` and `x`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` contains '/' for the loop to execute one more time**
