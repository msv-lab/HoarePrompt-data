Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is 0, the input value is a non-negative integer, `s` is the second word of the input value as a string, `s` is not equal to 'pwd', the first character of `s` is '/', `s` contains at least one '/' character after removing the first character. If x == '..', then `cur` remains an empty list and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cur` contains `x` and `i` remains 0.***
