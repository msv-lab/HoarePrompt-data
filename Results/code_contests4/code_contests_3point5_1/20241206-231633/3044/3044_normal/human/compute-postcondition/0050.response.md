According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If `i` is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is a list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string. If s is equal to 'pwd', no changes occur. If s is not equal to 'pwd', after processing all elements in s, `cur` will contain the final list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes an empty string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the input value needs to be greater than the current `i`.
State: **`cur` is a list, `i` is the updated integer value after the increment, `s` is an empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than the updated `i`**
