Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is modified by removing the last character from its string. The value of `i` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s` with the last character removed, `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s` with the last character removed, `i` remains 0**
