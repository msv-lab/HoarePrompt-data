Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, `s` is a string containing '/'. If `x` is equal to '..', then the last element is removed from `cur`. Otherwise, the value of `x` is appended to `cur`. In both cases, `i` is updated and `s` is maintained containing '/'.***
