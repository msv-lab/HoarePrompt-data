Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` is a string containing '/'. The program executes the if part if x is equal to '..', otherwise it executes the else part. In both cases, `cur` is modified based on the next element in `s`, `i` is updated, and `s` remains as '/'.***
