Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed using list slicing `[:-1]`. The variable `cur` is updated based on this operation. The other variables `i` and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is updated integer value after the increment, `s` is a string containing '/'.
Output State: **`cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is updated integer value after the increment, `s` is a string containing '/'**
