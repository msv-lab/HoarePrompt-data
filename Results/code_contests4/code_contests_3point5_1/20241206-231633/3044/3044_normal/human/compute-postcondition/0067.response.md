According to the code, the loop execution depends on the elements generated by splitting the string `s` using '/'. If there are more elements to iterate over, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` contains '/'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `s` after splitting should be available for iteration.

State: **`cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` contains '/' for the loop to execute one more time**
