Output State: **`cur` is a list with adjustments based on the elements in `s`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` is a string containing '/'. The loop iterates through the elements in `s` splitting by '/', and if the element is '..', the last element is removed from `cur`, otherwise the element is appended to `cur`. `i` is updated accordingly, and `s` remains as '/' after all iterations have finished.**
