Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is modified by removing the last character. The previous value of `cur` is the next element after `x` in the split of `s`, with the last character removed if `x` is equal to '..', or with `x` appended at the end if `x` is not equal to '..'. After executing the code, `cur` will have the last character removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s`, with the last character removed if `x` is equal to '..', or with `x` appended at the end if `x` is not equal to '..', `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`cur` contains the next element after `x` in the split of `s`, with the last character removed if `x` is equal to '..', or with `x` appended at the end if `x` is not equal to '..', `i` remains 0**
