Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The values of `i` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string containing the second word of the original string.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string containing the second word of the original string**
