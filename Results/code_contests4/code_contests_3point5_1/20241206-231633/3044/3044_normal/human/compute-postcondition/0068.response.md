Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed using slicing `[:-1]`. The values of `i` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` contains '/' for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, and `s` contains '/' for the loop to execute one more time**
