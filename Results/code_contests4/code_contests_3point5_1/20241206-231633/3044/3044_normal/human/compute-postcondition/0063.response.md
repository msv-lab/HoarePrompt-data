According to the code, the loop execution depends on the elements obtained after splitting the string `s` using '/'. The loop will execute as long as there are elements left to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is a list, `i` is an updated integer value after the increment, `s` is a string containing '/'. If `x` is equal to '..', then the last element is removed from `cur`. Otherwise, the value of `x` is appended to `cur`. In both cases, `i` is updated and `s` is maintained containing '/'.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the next element obtained after splitting `s` using '/' is '..', then the last element should be removed from `cur`.
2. If the next element obtained after splitting `s` using '/' is not '..', then that element should be appended to `cur`.
3. Update `i` after the increment by 1.
4. Maintain `s` containing '/'.

State: **`cur` is a list with adjustments based on the next element in `s`, `i` is updated integer value after the increment, `s` is a string containing '/'**
