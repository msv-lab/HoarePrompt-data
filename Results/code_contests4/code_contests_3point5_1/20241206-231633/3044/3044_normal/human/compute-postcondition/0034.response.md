According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` contains at least one '/', the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted based on the value of the first character of `s`.

If the first character of `s` is '/', then `cur` becomes an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character.

If the first character of `s` is not '/', then there is no change in the values of `cur`, `i`, and `s`.

State: **If the first character of `s` is '/', `cur` becomes an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `cur`, `i`, and `s`, for the loop to execute `s` contains at least one '/'**
