Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is an integer, `s` is a string. If the first character of `s` is '/', then `cur` becomes an empty list, `i` remains an integer, and `s` becomes a string containing all characters of the original string except the first character. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `cur`, `i`, and `s`.***
