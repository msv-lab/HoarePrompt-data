The code snippet `print(*j)` will print all elements of the list `j` separated by a space. There are no changes to the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of the next element in the list `ans[i+1]` is printed.
Output State: **The value of the next element in the list `ans[i+1]` is printed**
