Example Answer:
The code appends a sublist `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1` of the `ans` list. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 elements, and `ans` contains `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 2, j[0]], [i + n + 2, j[1]], [i + n + 1, j[0]]` appended to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 elements, `ans` contains `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 2, j[0]], [i + n + 2, j[1]], [i + n + 1, j[0]]` appended to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1`**
