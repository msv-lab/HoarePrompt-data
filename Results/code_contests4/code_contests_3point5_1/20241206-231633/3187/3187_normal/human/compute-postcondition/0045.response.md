Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints all elements in list `j` with a space in between. The state of the variables does not change by executing this code. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, the length of the string at index `i` has been printed, for the loop to execute the second time `ans[i]` has at least 2 elements, the elements of list `j` have been printed.
Output State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, the length of the string at index `i` has been printed, for the loop to execute the second time `ans[i]` has at least 2 elements, the elements of list `j` have been printed**
