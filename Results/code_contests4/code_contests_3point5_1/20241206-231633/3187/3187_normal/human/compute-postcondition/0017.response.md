Example Answer:
The code appends a new sublist `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1` in the `ans` list. The variables `n`, `m`, `edges` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 elements, `ans` contains `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 2, j[0]], [i + n + 2, j[1]], [i + n + 1, j[0], [i + n + 1, j[1]], [i + n + 1, j[0]]]` appended to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 elements, `ans` contains `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], ..., [n, n], [i + n + 2, j[0]], [i + n + 2, j[1]], [i + n + 1, j[0], [i + n + 1, j[1]], [i + n + 1, j[0]]]` appended to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1`**
