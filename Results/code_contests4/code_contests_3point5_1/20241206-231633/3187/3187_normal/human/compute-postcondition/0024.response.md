According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `ans[i]`. If there are more elements in the list, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` is printed on the console. To execute the loop one more time, the next value in the list `ans[i]` should be assigned to `j`.
State: **The value of the next element in the list `ans[i]` is assigned to `j`**
