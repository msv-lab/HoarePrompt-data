Example Answer:
`j` is printed using the `print(*j)` statement. The value of `j` is considered to be the next element in the list `ans[i]`, but the initial state does not provide any specific values for `ans` or `i`. Therefore, the output state is: The value of the next element in the list `ans[i]` is printed.
Output State: **The value of the next element in the list `ans[i]` is printed**
