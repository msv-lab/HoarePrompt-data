Example Answer:
`ans[i - 1]` appends the list `[i, i]` to the list at index `i - 1`. The initial state implies that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, so the loop executes the first time when `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, the list `[i, i]` is `[1, 1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, and `ans` contains `[1, 1]` at index 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, and `ans` contains `[1, 1]` at index 0**
