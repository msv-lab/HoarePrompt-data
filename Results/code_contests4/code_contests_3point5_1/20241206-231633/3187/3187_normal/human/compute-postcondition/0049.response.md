Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `m`, creates a list of lists for `edges` based on subsequent inputs, and initializes `ans` with sublists containing individual elements from 1 to `n`. It then appends combinations of elements to specific sublists in `ans` based on the input `edges`. Finally, it prints the length and elements of each sublist in `ans`. The function does not specify a clear overall purpose or constraints beyond handling input data and list manipulation.**
