According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ans[i]`. If `ans[i]` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, `i` will be updated to the last integer. So for the loop to be executed, `ans[i]` needs to have at least 1 element, `i` is updated to the last integer after the loop finishes, and `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`.
State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, the length of the string at index `i` has been printed, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[i]` has at least 1 element**
