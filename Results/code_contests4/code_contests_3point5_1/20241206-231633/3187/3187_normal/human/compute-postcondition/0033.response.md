According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ans[i]`. If `ans[i]` still has elements left to be iterated over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i`, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, and the length of `ans[i]` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `ans[i]` must still be greater than 0.
State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i`, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, the length of `ans[i]` is still greater than 0**
