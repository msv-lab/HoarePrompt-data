According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in `ans` have been printed in the console. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented and `n` should be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed in the console, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i`, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
