According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `edges` list since `enumerate(edges)` will generate tuples `(i, j)` for each element in the list. The loop will execute for each tuple in the `edges` list. At the start of the loop, `i` will be the index of the current tuple in the `edges` list and `j` will be the tuple itself.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 element, `ans` contains `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], ..., [n, n]]`.
