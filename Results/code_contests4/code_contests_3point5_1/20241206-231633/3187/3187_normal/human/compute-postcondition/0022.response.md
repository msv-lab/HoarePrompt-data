According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `i`. If `ans` is a list with at least `i+1` elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being greater than or equal to 0 and `m` being within the specified range does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `ans` is a list with at least `i+1` elements and `j` is the first element in `ans[i]`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, for the loop to execute the first time `ans` is a list with at least `i+1` elements, `j` is the first element in `ans[i]`**
