Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints` is defined to take input from the standard input and convert it into a list of integers using list comprehension. Since this function is defined but not called, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2).
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2)**
