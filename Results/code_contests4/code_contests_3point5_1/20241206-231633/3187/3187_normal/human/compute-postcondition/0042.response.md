According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ans[i]`. If `ans[i]` has at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, and the length of the string at index `i` has been printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ans[i]` must have at least one element.
State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, the length of the string at index `i` has been printed, for the loop to execute the second time `ans[i]` has at least 1 element**
