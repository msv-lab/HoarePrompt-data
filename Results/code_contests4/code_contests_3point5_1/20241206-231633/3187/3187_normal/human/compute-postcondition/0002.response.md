Example Answer:
The code initializes two lists, `edges` and `ans`. The `edges` list is populated with `m` lists of integers obtained from calling the `rints()` function, and the `ans` list is initialized with `n` empty lists. The values of `n` and `m` are not provided, so the sizes of `edges` and `ans` lists cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers within the specified ranges, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` is a list of empty lists.
Output State: **n and m are integers within the specified ranges, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, `ans` is a list of empty lists**
