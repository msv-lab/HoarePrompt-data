Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by the function `rints()`. The function `rints()` could potentially generate random integers within the specified range, so the values of `n` and `m` could vary. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: n and m are integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **n and m are integers within the specified ranges**
