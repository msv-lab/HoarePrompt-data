Example Answer:
The code prints the length of the sublist at index `i` in the `ans` list. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so the specific length cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, and `ans` contains various combinations appended to sublists.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers, and `ans` contains various combinations appended to sublists**
