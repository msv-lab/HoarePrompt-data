According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the length of `ans[i]`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i`, and the length of `ans[i]` is greater than 0. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0**
