Example Answer: 
The code prints all elements in `j` with a space between them. Since all elements in `ans` have been printed, and `i` is the new value, there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the new value, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, the length of `ans[i]` is still greater than 0.
Output State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the new value, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, the length of `ans[i]` is still greater than 0**
