According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `ans` is a list of empty lists does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is within the specified range, and `edges` is a list of lists of integers. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is within the specified range, `edges` is a list of lists of integers for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1**
