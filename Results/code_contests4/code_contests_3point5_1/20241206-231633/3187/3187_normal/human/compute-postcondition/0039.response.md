Example Answer:
The code prints the length of the string stored at index `i` in the list `ans`. The value of `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, so it holds the index of the last element in `ans`. Since the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, the code successfully prints the length of the string at index `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, and the length of the string at index `i` has been printed.
Output State: **All elements in `ans` have been printed, `i` is the last integer after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than the final value of `i+1`, the length of `ans[i+1]` is greater than 0, and the length of the string at index `i` has been printed**
