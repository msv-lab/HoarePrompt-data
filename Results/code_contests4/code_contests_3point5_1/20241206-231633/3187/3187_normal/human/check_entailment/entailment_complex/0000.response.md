Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the number of colors `n` and the number of pairs of colors which harmonize with each other `m`. It then creates a list of lists for `edges` based on the subsequent inputs. It initializes `ans` with sublists containing individual elements from 1 to `n`. It then appends combinations of elements to specific sublists in `ans` based on the input `edges`. Finally, it prints the length and elements of each sublist in `ans`.

The program follows the problem description accurately by creating a valid arrangement of rooks on a chessboard such that each color has a rook on the board, the set of rooks of each color is connected, and the set of rooks of different colors is connected only if those colors harmonize with each other. The program ensures that the total number of rooks does not exceed 5000, as required by the problem description.
