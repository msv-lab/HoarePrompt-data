Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for `n` and `m`, creates a list of lists for `edges` based on subsequent inputs, and initializes `ans` with sublists containing individual elements from 1 to `n`. 
- It then appends combinations of elements to specific sublists in `ans` based on the input `edges` which ensures that rooks of harmonizing colors are placed at the same coordinates.
- Finally, it prints the length and elements of each sublist in `ans`, satisfying the requirements of the problem description.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided.
