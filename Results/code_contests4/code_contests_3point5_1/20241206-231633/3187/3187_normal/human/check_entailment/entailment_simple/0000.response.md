Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It initializes a list `ans` with `n` sublists, each containing a single coordinate `[i, i]` for each color `i`. Then, it iterates over the pairs of harmonizing colors and adds coordinates to the corresponding sublists. Finally, it prints the number of rooks for each color and their coordinates.

The program ensures that:
1. Each color has at least one rook on the board.
2. The set of rooks of the same color is connected.
3. The union of the set of rooks of different colors is connected if and only if the colors harmonize with each other.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description for all possible cases.
