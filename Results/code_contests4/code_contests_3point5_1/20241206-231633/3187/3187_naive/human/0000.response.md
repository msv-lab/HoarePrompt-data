Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for the number of colors and pairs of colors which harmonize with each other. It then creates a list of lists to store the rooks of each color.

For each color, it adds a rook at the same position. Then, for each pair of harmonizing colors, it adds a rook at the respective positions to connect the sets of rooks. Finally, it prints the number of rooks for each color and their coordinates.

The program ensures that each color has at least one rook, the set of rooks of the same color is connected, and the union of sets of rooks of different colors is connected if and only if the colors harmonize with each other.
