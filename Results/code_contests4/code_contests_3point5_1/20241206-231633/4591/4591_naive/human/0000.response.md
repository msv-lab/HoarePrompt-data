Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The program follows the problem description accurately. It calculates the cube root approximation of the input number q using the provided recurrence formula. It stops the calculation when the difference between x^3 and q is less than 0.00001*q, as specified in the problem description. The program also handles multiple datasets and prints the output with an error of 0.00001. Overall, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
