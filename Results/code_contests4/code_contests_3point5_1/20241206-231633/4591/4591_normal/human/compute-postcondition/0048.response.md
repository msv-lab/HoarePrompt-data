Example Answer: 
The value of `diff` is calculated as `q * 1e-05`. If `q` is -1, `diff` will be adjusted based on calculations until the absolute value of x cubed minus q is less than the calculated `diff`. If `q` is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff`. The value of `x` is printed with 6 decimal places, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **If q is -1, `x` is adjusted based on calculations until the absolute value of x cubed minus q is less than `diff`. If q is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff`.
