Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `int(line)`, where `line` is assumed to be a string input. Since `q` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, the value of `q` is updated accordingly. The values of `x` and `diff` are not affected by this line of code. 
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `x` is adjusted based on calculations within the loop, `diff` is also updated accordingly**
