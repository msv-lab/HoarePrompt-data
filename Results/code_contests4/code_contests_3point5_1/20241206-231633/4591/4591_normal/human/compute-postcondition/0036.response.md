Postcondition: ***If q is -1, `x` is adjusted based on calculations within the loop, `diff` is updated accordingly, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If q is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff`. Additionally, if the absolute value of `x` cubed minus q is less than `diff`, then the program will adjust `x` and `diff` accordingly, and exit the most internal loop or if statement.***
