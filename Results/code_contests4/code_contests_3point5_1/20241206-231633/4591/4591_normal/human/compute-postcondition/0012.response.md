According to the code, the loop will always execute since it is a `while True` loop. The loop will only break if the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are `q` and `diff` based on the value of `x`.
State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `diff` is calculated based on the value of `q` for the loop to execute again**
