Output State: **After the loop executes, `q` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31. The value of `x` is adjusted based on the calculations within the loop, and `diff` is also updated accordingly. The loop breaks when the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`.**
