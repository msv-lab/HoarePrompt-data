Example Answer:
If q is -1, `x` will be adjusted based on the calculations within the loop until the absolute value of `x` cubed minus q is less than `diff`, then the loop will exit. If q is different from -1, no changes will be made to `x` and `diff`. The value of `x` will be printed with 6 decimal places.
Output State: **If q is -1, `x` is adjusted based on calculations within the loop until the absolute value of `x` cubed minus q is less than `diff`, then the loop will exit. If q is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff`. The value of `x` is printed with 6 decimal places.**
