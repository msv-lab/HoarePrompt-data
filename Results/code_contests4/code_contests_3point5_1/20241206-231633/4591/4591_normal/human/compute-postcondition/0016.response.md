According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely until a break statement is encountered. The condition for breaking out of the loop is if the absolute value of the cube of `x` minus `q` is less than `diff`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `x` and `diff` need to be adjusted such that the condition for breaking out of the loop is not met.

State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31. For the loop to execute again, adjust the values of `x` and `diff` such that the condition for breaking out of the loop is not met**.
