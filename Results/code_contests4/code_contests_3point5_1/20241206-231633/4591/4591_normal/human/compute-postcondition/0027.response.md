Example Answer:
The value of `diff` is calculated as `q * 1e-05`. If `q` is not equal to -1, then `x` and `diff` remain unchanged. If `q` is -1, then `x` is adjusted based on calculations within the loop, `diff` is updated according to the calculation, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State: **If q is -1, `x` is adjusted based on calculations within the loop, `diff` is updated accordingly, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If q is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff`.**
