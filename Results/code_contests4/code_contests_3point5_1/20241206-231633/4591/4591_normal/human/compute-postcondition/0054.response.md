According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **If q is -1, the value of `x` is adjusted based on calculations until the absolute value of x cubed minus q is less than `diff`. If q is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff`. The value of `x` is printed with 6 decimal places and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `abs(x)` is calculated.**
