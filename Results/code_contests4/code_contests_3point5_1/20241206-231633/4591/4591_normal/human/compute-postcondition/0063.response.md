Output State: If q is -1, `x` is adjusted based on calculations until the absolute value of x cubed minus q is less than `diff`. The value of `x` is printed with 6 decimal places and we break out of the loop when abs(x^3 - q) < diff. If q is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff` remains unchanged. After the loop finishes executing, `x` will be the value that satisfies abs(x^3 - q) < diff, with x printed with 6 decimal places. `x` is the final value that satisfies the condition.
