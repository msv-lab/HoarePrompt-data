Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated by the formula provided. The value of `q` is used in the calculation of `diff`, which is not explicitly shown. Since `q` is a positive integer, the value of `diff` will be influenced by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `diff` is calculated based on the value of `q`.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `diff` is calculated based on the value of `q`**
