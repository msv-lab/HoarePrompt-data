According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is an input line available from the standard input (stdin). Since the loop reads from the standard input, the loop will execute at least once as long as there is input available. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that there is an input line available from the standard input.
State: **q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, for the loop to execute there is an input line available from the standard input**
