Example Answer:
`x` is updated based on the formula provided. The initial state of `q` is used in the calculation of `x`. The loop will execute again based on the value of `diff`, which is calculated based on `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `diff` is calculated based on the value of `q` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31, `diff` is calculated based on the value of `q` for the loop to execute again**
