Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value `int(line)`, where `line` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31. Therefore, the Output State is: q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31.
Output State: **q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q < 2^31**
