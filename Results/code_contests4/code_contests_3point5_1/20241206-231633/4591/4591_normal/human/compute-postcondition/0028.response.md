Since the `while` loop condition is `while True`, it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no changes need to be made to the state before the loop.
State: **If q is -1, `x` is adjusted based on calculations within the loop, `diff` is updated accordingly, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If q is different from -1, no changes are made to `x` and `diff`**
