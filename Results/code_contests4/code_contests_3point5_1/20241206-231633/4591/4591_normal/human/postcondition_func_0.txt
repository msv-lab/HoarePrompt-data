The function `func` reads input from standard input, calculates a value `x` iteratively using the Newton-Raphson method to find the cube root of the input `q`, and prints the result with 6 decimal places. The function does not accept any parameters. The code seems to handle the case where the input value `q` is -1 to exit the loop. However, the return value or output of the function is not explicitly defined in the annotations.
