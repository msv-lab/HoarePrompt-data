Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the cube root of the input `q`.
- It follows the problem description by initializing `x` as `q / 2.0`, calculating the difference threshold as `q * 1e-05`, and updating `x` iteratively until the condition `abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff` is met.
- The code handles the case where the input value `q` is -1 to exit the loop.
- The output is formatted as requested with 6 decimal places. 
- There are no evident edge cases that the code is not handling, and the output hints also align with the code's functionality.
