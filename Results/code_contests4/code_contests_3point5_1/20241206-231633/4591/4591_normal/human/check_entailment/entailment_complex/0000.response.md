Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the Newton-Raphson method to find the cube root of the input value `q`. It follows the problem description by initializing `x` with `q / 2.0`, calculating the difference threshold `diff` as `q * 1e-05`, and iteratively updating `x` until the condition `abs(x ** 3 - q) < diff` is met.

The program also handles the case where the input value `q` is -1 to exit the loop. The output is formatted to display `x` with 6 decimal places, as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for each dataset.
