Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It takes a positive integer q as input, initializes x to q/2.0, calculates the difference threshold based on q, then iterates using the provided recurrence formula until the condition abs(x^3 - q) < diff is met. It then outputs the final value of x with 6 decimal places. The program stops when -1 is entered as input, as specified in the problem description.

The program ensures that the approximation of the cube root of q is within the specified error margin and stops when the difference is small enough. Hence, it correctly implements the provided problem description.
