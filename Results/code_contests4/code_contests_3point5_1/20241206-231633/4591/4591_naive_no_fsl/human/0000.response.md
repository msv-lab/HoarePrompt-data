Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program follows the given problem description accurately. It calculates the cube root of a given input number using the provided recurrence formula and stops the calculation when the difference between the cube of the current approximation and the input number is less than 0.00001 times the input number. The program handles multiple datasets as described and outputs the approximate cube root for each dataset. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem requirements, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
