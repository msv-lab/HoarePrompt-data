Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks for specific combinations of A, B, and C values to print 'YES'. It does not cover all possible valid combinations of A, B, and C to construct a Haiku. For example, if A=7, B=5, and C=5, the program should also print 'YES' as it is a valid combination for a Haiku.
