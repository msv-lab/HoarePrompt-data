Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of A, B, and C can range from 1 to 10, so after execution, `a`, `b`, and `c` will have values within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers ranging from 1 to 10.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers ranging from 1 to 10**
