Postcondition: **A, B, and C are integers ranging from 1 to 10. If A is equal to 5, B is equal to 7, and C is equal to 5, then 'YES' is printed. If A is not equal to 5 or B is not equal to 7 or C is not equal to 5, the program does not enter the if block. If A is not equal to 5 or B is not equal to 5 or C is not equal to 7 and A is not equal to 7, B is equal to 5, and C is equal to 5, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
