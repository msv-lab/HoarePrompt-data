The function `func` reads three integers A, B, and C as input and checks if they match specific values. If A is 5, B is 5, and C is 7, or A is 5, B is 7, and C is 5, or A is 7, B is 5, and C is 5, then 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The function does not have any explicit return value specified.
