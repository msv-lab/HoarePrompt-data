You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Iroha loves Haiku. Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order.

To create a Haiku, Iroha has come up with three different phrases. These phrases have A, B and C syllables, respectively. Determine whether she can construct a Haiku by using each of the phrases once, in some order.

Constraints

* 1≦A,B,C≦10

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A B C


Output

If it is possible to construct a Haiku by using each of the phrases once, print `YES` (case-sensitive). Otherwise, print `NO`.

Examples

Input

5 5 7


Output

YES


Input

7 7 5


Output

NO
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10.
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if (a == 5 and b == 5 and c == 7) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (a == 5 and b == 7 and c == 5) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            if (a == 7 and b == 5 and c == 5) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                print('NO')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *A, B, and C are integers ranging from 1 to 10. If A is not equal to 5 or B is not equal to 7 or C is not equal to 5, the program does not enter the if block. If A is not equal to 5 or B is not equal to 5 or C is not equal to 7 and A is not equal to 7, B is equal to 5, and C is equal to 5, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: A, B, and C are integers ranging from 1 to 10. If A is equal to 5, B is equal to 7, and C is equal to 5, then 'YES' is printed. If A is not equal to 5 or B is not equal to 7 or C is not equal to 5, the program does not enter the if block. If A is not equal to 5 or B is not equal to 5 or C is not equal to 7 and A is not equal to 7, B is equal to 5, and C is equal to 5, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *A, B, and C are integers ranging from 1 to 10. If a == 5, b == 5, and c == 7, then 'YES' is printed. If a == 5, b == 7, and c == 5, then 'YES' is printed. If none of these conditions are met, 'NO' is printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
