Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly checks if the input values A, B, and C match the required syllable counts for a Haiku. It covers all possible valid combinations (5-5-7, 5-7-5, 7-5-5) and prints 'YES' if any of these combinations are met. If none of the valid combinations are found, it prints 'NO'. The code aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all cases.
