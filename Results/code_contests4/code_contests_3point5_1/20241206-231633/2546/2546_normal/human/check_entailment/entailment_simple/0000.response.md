Correctness: **True**

The program checks if the input values match the specific combinations required to construct a Haiku (5-5-7, 5-7-5, 7-5-5). If any of these combinations are present, it prints 'YES'. If none of these combinations are present, it prints 'NO'. This logic matches the problem description accurately and ensures that the Haiku construction is correctly determined.
