Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three integers A, B, and C as input and checks if they match specific values to determine if a Haiku can be constructed. If A is 5, B is 5, and C is 7, or A is 5, B is 7, and C is 5, or A is 7, B is 5, and C is 5, then 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program covers all the possible combinations of A, B, and C to decide whether a Haiku can be constructed.
