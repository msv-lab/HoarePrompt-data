The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s` and the string `s` itself. If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s` and prints the result. If the length of `s` is greater than 26, it prints -1. The function does not return any value.
