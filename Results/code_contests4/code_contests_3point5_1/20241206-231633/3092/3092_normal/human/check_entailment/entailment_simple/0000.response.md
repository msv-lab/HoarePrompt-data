Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if the length of the string `n` is less than or equal to 26, and if it is, it calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct. If the length of the string is greater than 26, it returns -1 as it is impossible to make all substrings distinct in that case. The program handles the cases as described in the problem and provides the correct output.
