Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s` and the string `s` itself. If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s` and prints the result. If the length of `s` is greater than 26, it prints -1. This aligns with the problem description where Kerem wants all substrings of his string to be distinct, and the code calculates the minimum number of changes required to achieve this. The code also covers the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
