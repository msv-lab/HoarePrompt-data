Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s` and the string `s` itself. If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between `n` and the number of unique characters in `s` and prints the result. If the length of `s` is greater than 26, it prints -1. This matches the requirements of the problem description, as it determines the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct, or indicates if it is impossible. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
