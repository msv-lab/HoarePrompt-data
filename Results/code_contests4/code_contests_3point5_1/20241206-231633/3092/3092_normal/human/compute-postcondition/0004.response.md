Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - len(set(s))`. The value of `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `s` consists of only lowercase English letters. Taking the set of `s` removes any duplicate letters, so `len(set(s))` gives the number of unique letters in the string. Therefore, `result` will be the difference between the total number of letters and the number of unique letters in the string. Since `n` is less than or equal to 26, `result` will be a non-negative integer. 
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the input received from the user as an integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters. `result` is a non-negative integer.**
