Example Answer:
The value of `n` is assigned the input received from the user as an integer. The value of `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the result is a non-negative integer. If `n` is larger than 26, the result is -1. The code then prints the result as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and the result is either a non-negative integer if `n` is less than or equal to 26, or -1 if `n` is larger than 26.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and the result is either a non-negative integer if `n` is less than or equal to 26, or -1 if `n` is larger than 26**
