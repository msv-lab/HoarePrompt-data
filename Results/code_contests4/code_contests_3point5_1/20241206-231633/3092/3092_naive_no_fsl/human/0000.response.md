Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 26, which is the total number of lowercase English letters. If it is, then it calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct. If the length of the string is greater than 26, it is impossible to make all substrings distinct, so it outputs -1.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
