Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input values for the length of the string and the string itself.
2. It then checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of changes needed by subtracting the length of the set of characters in the string from the length of the string. This is a valid approach because if the number of unique characters is equal to the length of the string, then all substrings will be distinct.
3. If the length of the string is greater than 26, it returns -1 as it is impossible to have unique substrings with more than 26 characters.
4. The program then prints the result as a string.
5. The logic of the program is correct and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
