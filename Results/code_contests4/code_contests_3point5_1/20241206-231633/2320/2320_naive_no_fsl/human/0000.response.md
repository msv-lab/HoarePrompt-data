Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, specifically in the calculation of `y` using integer division. In Python 2, the division operator `/` performs integer division if both operands are integers. This can result in loss of precision and incorrect calculations.

To fix this issue, the program should use floating-point division by casting at least one operand to a float before performing the division. This will ensure accurate calculations and correct results.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    (g, tmp_x, tmp_y) = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / float(b))  # Use floating-point division here
    return (g, x, y)
```

By making this modification, the program should now correctly determine the starting cell for Vanya's path to see as many apple trees as possible.
