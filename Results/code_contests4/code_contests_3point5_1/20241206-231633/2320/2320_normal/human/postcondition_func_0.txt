The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and performs the Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. 
If `b` is 0, it returns the integer value of `a`, 1, and 0. 
In other cases, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, then calculates and returns the gcd as 'g', along with new values for 'x' and 'y' based on the recursive calls. 
The functionality of the function is to compute the gcd of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
