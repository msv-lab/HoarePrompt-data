Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`, which was returned from `func_1`. The previous values of `b`, `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` are not relevant to this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a variable (not equal to 0), `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` have new values returned from `func_1`, `x` is now assigned the value of `tmp_y`.
Output State: **`b` is a variable (not equal to 0), `g`, `tmp_x`, and `tmp_y` have new values returned from `func_1`, `x` is now assigned the value of `tmp_y`**
