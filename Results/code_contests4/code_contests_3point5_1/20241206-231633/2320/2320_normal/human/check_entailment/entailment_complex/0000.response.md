Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that implements the Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers `a` and `b`. The program does not directly solve the problem described in the problem description, but the implementation of the Euclidean Algorithm is correct based on the annotations provided.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the annotations and correctly implements the Euclidean Algorithm.
