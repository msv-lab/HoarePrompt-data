Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes the input and calculates the coordinates of the cell from which Vanya should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible. 
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm, which is relevant for the problem.
- The code iterates through the input apple tree coordinates, calculates the corresponding cell coordinates based on Vanya's movement vector, and updates the count of apple trees seen from each cell.
- Finally, it determines the cell with the maximum count of apple trees seen and prints the coordinates.
- The output matches the problem description and the code logic, ensuring that the program works correctly for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
