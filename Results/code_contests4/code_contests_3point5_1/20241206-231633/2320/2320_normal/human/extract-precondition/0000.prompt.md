You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vanya decided to walk in the field of size n × n cells. The field contains m apple trees, the i-th apple tree is at the cell with coordinates (xi, yi). Vanya moves towards vector (dx, dy). That means that if Vanya is now at the cell (x, y), then in a second he will be at cell <image>. The following condition is satisfied for the vector: <image>, where <image> is the largest integer that divides both a and b. Vanya ends his path when he reaches the square he has already visited. 

Vanya wonders, from what square of the field he should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible.

Input

The first line contains integers n, m, dx, dy(1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ n) — the size of the field, the number of apple trees and the vector of Vanya's movement. Next m lines contain integers xi, yi (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n - 1) — the coordinates of apples. One cell may contain multiple apple trees.

Output

Print two space-separated numbers — the coordinates of the cell from which you should start your path. If there are several answers you are allowed to print any of them.

Examples

Input

5 5 2 3
0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 1


Output

1 3


Input

2 3 1 1
0 0
0 1
1 1


Output

0 0

Note

In the first sample Vanya's path will look like: (1, 3) - (3, 1) - (0, 4) - (2, 2) - (4, 0) - (1, 3)

In the second sample: (0, 0) - (1, 1) - (0, 0)
Function definition:
```
def func_1(a, b):
```
