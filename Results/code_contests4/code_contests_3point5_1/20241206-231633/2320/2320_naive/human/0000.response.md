Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The issue lies in the logic of calculating the maximum number of apple trees that Vanya can see from a starting cell. The current implementation may not always consider the optimal starting cell to maximize the number of apple trees seen. To demonstrate this, consider the following case:

Input:
5 5 2 3
0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 1

Expected Output:
1 3

Explanation:
In this case, the correct output should be (1, 3) as it is the optimal starting cell that allows Vanya to see all 5 apple trees. However, the provided program may not always output the correct starting cell.
