Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The function `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi, but the implementation of this function is incorrect and does not follow the problem description. Additionally, the use of sets, lists, and dictionaries in the program seems to be confusing and unnecessary for solving the given problem. 

Overall, the program does not provide the correct output for the given problem, and it fails to handle the family tree relationships as described in the problem description.
