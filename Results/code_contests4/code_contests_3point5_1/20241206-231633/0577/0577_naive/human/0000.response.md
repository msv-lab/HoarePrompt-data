Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The function `func_1` in the program is trying to determine the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi. However, the implementation is complex and seems to have issues.

One potential issue is with the way the sets are being manipulated and checked. The logic in the function `func_1` is difficult to follow and verify for correctness. There could be problems with updating the sets and calculating the correct number of distinct names.

To verify the correctness of the program, we would need to provide test cases where the output of the program does not match the expected output based on the problem description.
