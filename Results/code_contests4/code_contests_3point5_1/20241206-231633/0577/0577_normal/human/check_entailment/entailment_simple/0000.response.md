Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not seem to be directly related to the problem description provided. The function `func_1` appears to be performing some kind of recursive update on a tree-like structure, which is different from the problem of calculating the number of distinct names among the ki-sons of the man with number vi.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is considered incorrect.
