Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` seems to be attempting to calculate the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons of the man with number vi as specified in the problem description. However, the logic within the function is complex and not clearly defined. The while loop and the conditions inside it are not straightforward and may not accurately achieve the desired outcome.

Additionally, the output hints provided do not align well with the code. The hints mention the function `func_1` accepting two parameters and containing a while loop, but the actual purpose or functionality of the function is not explicitly described. The hints do not provide a clear indication of how the code should be implemented to correctly solve the given problem.

Therefore, based on the complexity of the code and the lack of clear alignment with the problem description and output hints, the correctness of the code is deemed as **False**.
