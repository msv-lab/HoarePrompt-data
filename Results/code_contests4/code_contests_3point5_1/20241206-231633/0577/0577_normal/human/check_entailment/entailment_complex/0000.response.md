Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not seem to be relevant to the problem description given. The function `func_1` is not related to the family tree and finding sons as described in the problem. The function seems to be manipulating data structures without a clear purpose or outcome related to the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
