Postcondition: ***The program updates variables based on conditional checks and assigns a value to `ans[x][dep]`. For the loop to execute, `query[x]` must have a length of at least 2, `nowlistindex` must be 0, `i` must be assigned the value `query[x][nowlistindex]`, and `j` must be assigned the value `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. If `dep + i` is not present in `ans[x]`, then the value of `answer[j]` is set to 0. If `(dep + i)` is present in `ans[x]`, then the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` is assigned to `answer[j]`.***
