Postcondition: ***Before the loop, the length of `ans[x]` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. If j is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
