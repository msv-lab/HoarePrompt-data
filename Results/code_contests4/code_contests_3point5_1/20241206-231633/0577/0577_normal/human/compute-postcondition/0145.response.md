Example Answer:
The code clears the contents of the list `ans[x][j]`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]` where the contents of `ans[x][j]` have been cleared.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]` where the contents of `ans[x][j]` have been cleared.**
