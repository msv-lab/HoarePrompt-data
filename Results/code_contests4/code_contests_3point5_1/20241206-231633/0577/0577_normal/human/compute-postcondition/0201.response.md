Example Answer:
`dep` is decremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1, `dep` is decreased by 1, all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`.
Output State: **`x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1, `dep` is decreased by 1, all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`**
