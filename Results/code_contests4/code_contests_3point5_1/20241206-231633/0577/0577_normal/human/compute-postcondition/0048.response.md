Postcondition: ***All initial conditions remain true. If j is in ans[fa[x]] and the length of ans[x][j] is less than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], ans[fa[x]][j] is cleared. If len(ans[x][j]) < len(ans[fa[x]][j]), ans[fa[x]][j] is cleared. Otherwise, ans[fa[x]][j] remains an empty list and ans[x][j] is updated with the logical OR of its previous value and an empty list.***
