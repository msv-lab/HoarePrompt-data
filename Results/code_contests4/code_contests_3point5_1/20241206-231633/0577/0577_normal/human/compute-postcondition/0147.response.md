Example Answer:
The `clear()` method is called on the list `ans[fa[x]][j]`, which empties the list. The values of `fa[x]` and `j` are not known, so the length of the list before clearing is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]**.
