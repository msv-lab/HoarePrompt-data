Postcondition: ***After the completion of the if-else block, the final state is such that all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`. Additionally, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will remain unchanged.***
