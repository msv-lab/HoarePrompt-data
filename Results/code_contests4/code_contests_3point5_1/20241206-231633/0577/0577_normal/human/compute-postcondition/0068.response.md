Postcondition: ***`x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, `len(query[x])` is greater than 0, `i` is the value at index `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`, `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`, `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, `len(ans[x])` is greater than or equal to `len(ans[fa[x]])`, `j` is in `ans[x]`, and (len(ans[x][j]) <= len(ans[fa[x]][j]))***
