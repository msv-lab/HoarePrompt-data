Example Answer:
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. Additionally, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, but `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. After execution, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]. Therefore, the Output State is: Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` but `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]`.
Output State: **Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` but `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]`.**
