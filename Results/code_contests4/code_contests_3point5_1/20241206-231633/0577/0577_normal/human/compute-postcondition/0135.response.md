Example Answer:
The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the contents of the list `ans[x][j]`. This means that all elements in the list will be removed. The initial state mentions that all elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, so after clearing `ans[x][j]`, all elements in the `answer` list will become 0.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list are 0**
