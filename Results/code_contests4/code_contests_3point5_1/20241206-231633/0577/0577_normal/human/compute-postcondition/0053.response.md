Example Answer:
The value of `ans[x][j]` is updated to be a bitwise OR operation between its current value and the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. All other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All initial conditions remain true, `ans[x][j]` is updated with a bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`.**
