Postcondition: ***All the elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`. After the if condition, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]` for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`***
