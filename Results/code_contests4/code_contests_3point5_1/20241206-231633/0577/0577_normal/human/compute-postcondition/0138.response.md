Output State: **All the elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`. After the else block, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]` for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]` and len(ans[x][j]) is greater than or equal to len(ans[fa[x]][j]). The element at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation between the elements at index `j` in `ans[x] and `ans[fa[x]]`. The elements at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` are cleared.**
