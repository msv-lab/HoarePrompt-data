Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The loop will execute one more time, so the previous values of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` are not specified. After the assignment, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
