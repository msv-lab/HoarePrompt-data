Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`. The length of `ans[x]` is still greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. The elements in `ans[fa[x]]` at index `j` are updated with the bitwise OR operation of the elements at the same index `j` in `ans[x]`.**
