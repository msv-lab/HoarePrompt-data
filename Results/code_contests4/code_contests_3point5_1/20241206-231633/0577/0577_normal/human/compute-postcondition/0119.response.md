Postcondition: ***`j` is assigned a value from `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. For the loop to execute again, `query[x]` must have a length of at least 4, `nowlistindex` must be 2, `i` is assigned the value `query[x][2]`, and `j` is assigned the value `query[x][3]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `j` is assigned `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`.***
