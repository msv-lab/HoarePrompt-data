Postcondition: ***All elements in the `answer` list will be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned for the loop to execute another time. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the `j`-th element in the `answer` list will be cleared. Otherwise, no specific values can be determined for the elements in the `answer` list.***
