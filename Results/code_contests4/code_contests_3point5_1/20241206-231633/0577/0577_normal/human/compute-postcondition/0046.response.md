Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, where `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list and `ans[x][j]` is updated with the logical OR of its previous value and an empty list. The values of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` are now linked. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the logical OR of its previous value and an empty list.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the logical OR of its previous value and an empty list**
