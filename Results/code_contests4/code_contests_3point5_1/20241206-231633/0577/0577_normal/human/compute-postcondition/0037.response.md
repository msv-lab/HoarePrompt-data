Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The initial conditions remain true, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All conditions specified in the initial state remain true, and `ans[x][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **All conditions specified in the initial state remain true, and `ans[x][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation of `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]**.
