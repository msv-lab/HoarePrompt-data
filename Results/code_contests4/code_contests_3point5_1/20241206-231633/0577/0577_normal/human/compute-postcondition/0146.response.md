Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` are modified accordingly. Since all elements in the `answer` list are either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, the updated values in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` will follow the same pattern. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]**.
