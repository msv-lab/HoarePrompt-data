Example Answer:
The value of `ans[x][j]` is updated to be the logical OR of its current value and the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **All initial conditions remain true. If j is in ans[fa[x]] and the length of ans[x][j] is less than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], ans[fa[x]][j] is cleared. ans[x][j] is updated to be the logical OR of its current value and the value of ans[fa[x]][j]**.
