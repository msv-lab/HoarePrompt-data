Example Answer:
The value at index `x` in the `ans` list at depth `dep` is assigned a set containing the value at index `x` in the `ss` list. Since the element at index `x` in both `nowChild` and `lenChild` lists is equal and `x` is not equal to 0, the value of `ss[x]` is assigned to `ans[x][dep]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is not equal to -1. `nowChild` and `lenChild` are lists. The element at index `x` in both lists is equal. `x` is not equal to 0, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value at index `x` in `ss`.
Output State: **`x` is not equal to -1. `nowChild` and `lenChild` are lists. The element at index `x` in both lists is equal. `x` is not equal to 0, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value at index `x` in `ss`**
