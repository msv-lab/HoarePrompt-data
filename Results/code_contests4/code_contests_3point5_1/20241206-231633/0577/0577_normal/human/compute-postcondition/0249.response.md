Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared by the `clear()` method. The loop will execute one more time as the conditions are maintained, and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the now cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will execute one more time, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **The loop will execute one more time, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]**
