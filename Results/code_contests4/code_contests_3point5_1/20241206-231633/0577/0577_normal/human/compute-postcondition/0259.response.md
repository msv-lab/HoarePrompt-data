Example Answer: 
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]` after the bitwise OR operation. Since the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the bitwise OR operation updates the value of `ans[x][j]` into `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: Before the loop, the length of `ans[x]` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, j is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j] and the value of `ans[x][j]` is updated by applying a bitwise OR operation with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
