Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`. The values of `ans`, `fa`, `x`, and `j` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: The value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`.
Output State: **The value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]**
