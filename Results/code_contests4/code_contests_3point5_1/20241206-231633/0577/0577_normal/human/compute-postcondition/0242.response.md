Postcondition: ***Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]` and `j` is in `ans[fa[x]`. If `len(ans[x][j])` is less than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then after the if condition, `len(ans[x][j])` is still less than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`, while `ans[x][j]` is cleared. If `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than or equal to `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then after the else condition, `len(ans[x][j])` is still greater than or equal to `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the value of `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.***
