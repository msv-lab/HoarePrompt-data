Postcondition: ***`x` is not equal to -1. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1, and `dep` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `dep` is increased by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, based on whether `dep + i` exists in `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the elements in the `ans` list will be cleared. Otherwise, the list at `ans[fa[x]]` will be cleared.***
