Example Answer: 
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Given the initial state, the length of `ans[x]` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. After execution, the assignment is made, and the states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **Before the loop, the length of `ans[x]` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, j is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
