Example Answer:
The elements in the `answer` list will be updated where each element in `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the corresponding element in `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[fa[x]]` will be the same as the length of `ans[x]`. The conditions for the loop to execute again are dependent on the elements present in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`. 
Output State: **Elements in the `answer` list are updated based on the assignment of elements from `ans[x]` to `ans[fa[x]]**
