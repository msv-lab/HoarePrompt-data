Output State: **`x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, `len(query[x])` is greater than 0, `i` is the value at index `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`, `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`**.
