Postcondition: ***`x` is not equal to -1, if `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1, `dep` is decremented by 1, and all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`. Otherwise, `dep` is increased by 1.***
