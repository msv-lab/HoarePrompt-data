Postcondition: ***`x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `query[x]`, `nowlistindex`, `i` remain unchanged. `ans[x][dep]` is updated with `{ss[x]}`. For the loop to execute, `ans[fa[x]]` has at least one element. `len(ans[x])` is not less than `len(ans[fa[x]])`. `j` is in `ans[x]`. If `len(ans[x][j])` is greater than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, all elements in `ans[x][j]` are updated with the elements in `ans[fa[x]][j]` through bitwise OR operation. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j`.***
