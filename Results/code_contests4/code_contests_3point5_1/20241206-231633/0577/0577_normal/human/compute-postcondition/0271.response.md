Example Answer:
The elements in `ans[fa[x]][j]` are cleared. This means that all elements that were previously in `ans[fa[x]][j]` are now removed. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `ans[x][j]` are updated with the elements in `ans[fa[x]][j]` through bitwise OR operation.
Output State: **All elements in `ans[x][j]` are updated with the elements in `ans[fa[x]][j]` through bitwise OR operation**
