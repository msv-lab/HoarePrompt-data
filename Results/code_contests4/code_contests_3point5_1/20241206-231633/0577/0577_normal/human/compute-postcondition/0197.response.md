Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, all the elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the elements in the `ans` list will be cleared. Otherwise, the list at `ans[fa[x]]` will be cleared.***
