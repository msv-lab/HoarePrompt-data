Postcondition: ***`x` is not equal to -1 or 0. `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x`. `ans[x][j]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`. `len(query[x])` is greater than 0. `i` is the value at index `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`. `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`. `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`. `len(ans[x])` is greater than or equal to `len(ans[fa[x]])`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]` and `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, the value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]` after the if else block executes.***
