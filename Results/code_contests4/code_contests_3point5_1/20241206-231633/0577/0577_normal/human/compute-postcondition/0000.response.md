According to the code, the loop will keep executing as long as `x` is not equal to -1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, right before the loop, `x` should not be equal to -1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **for the loop to execute the first time, `x` is not equal to -1**
