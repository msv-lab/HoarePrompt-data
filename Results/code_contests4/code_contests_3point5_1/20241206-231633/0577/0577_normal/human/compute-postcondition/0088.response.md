Example Answer:
The `clear()` method removes all items from the list `ans[x][j]`. The loop executes one more time with updated values, so the previous values of `ans[x][j]` are not known. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop executes one more time with updated values.
Output State: **The loop executes one more time with updated values**
