Example Answer:
The value of `dep` is decremented by 1. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated based on `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1; `dep` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`x` is updated based on `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x] is incremented by 1; `dep` is decremented by 1**
