Example Answer:
The value of `dep` is decremented by 1. The values of `x` and `nowChild[fa[x]]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is now updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1; `dep` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`x` is now updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1; `dep` is decremented by 1**
