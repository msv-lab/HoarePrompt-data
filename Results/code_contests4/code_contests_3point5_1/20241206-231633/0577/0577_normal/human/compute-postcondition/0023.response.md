Postcondition: ***`x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, `len(query[x])` is greater than 0, `i` is the value at index `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`, `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`, for the loop to execute one more time `nowlistindex` should be adjusted to the next index in the range of `len(query[x])`, `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1`. After the if else block executes, if dep + i is not in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
