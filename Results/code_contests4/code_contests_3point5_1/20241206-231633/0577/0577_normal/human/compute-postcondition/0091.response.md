Postcondition: ***After one more iteration of the loop, if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, the loop updates the values accordingly. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the value at index `[fa[x]][j]` in the `ans` array is cleared. Otherwise, no changes are made to the array.***
