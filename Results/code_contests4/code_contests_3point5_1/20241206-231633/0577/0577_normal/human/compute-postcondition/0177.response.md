Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. After this assignment, the length of `ans[x][j]` will be either 0 or the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared. Otherwise, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the completion of the if-else block, all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, and the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
