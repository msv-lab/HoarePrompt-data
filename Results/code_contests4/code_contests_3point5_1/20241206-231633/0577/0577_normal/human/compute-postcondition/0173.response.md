Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The value of `j` can be any value based on the previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`**.
