Example Answer:
`answer[j]` is assigned the value of `len(ans[x][dep + i])`. The values of `x`, `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]`, `query[x]`, `i`, `j`, `dep`, and `nowlistindex` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, `len(query[x])` is greater than 0, `i` is the value at index `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`, `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`, and `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`.
Output State: **`x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, `len(query[x])` is greater than 0, `i` is the value at index `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`, `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`, and `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`**
