Example Answer:
The code clears the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`, which means the value at that index becomes 0. The value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is then updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and 0, which results in the value at index `j` being updated to the bitwise OR of its current value and 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and 0 after clearing the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]].
Output State: **The value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and 0 after clearing the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]**
