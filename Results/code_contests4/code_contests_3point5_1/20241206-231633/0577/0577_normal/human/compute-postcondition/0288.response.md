Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `query[x]`, `nowlistindex`, `i` remain unchanged. `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x][j]` is updated based on the mentioned conditions.
Output State: **`x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `query[x]`, `nowlistindex`, `i` remain unchanged. `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` and `ans[x][j]` is updated based on the mentioned conditions.**
