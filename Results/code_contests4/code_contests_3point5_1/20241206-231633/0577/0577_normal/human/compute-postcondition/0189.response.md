Example Answer:
The code `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` performs a bitwise OR operation between the lists `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]` and assigns the result back to `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The elements in both lists are either 0 or the length of the corresponding values. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared, otherwise, it will remain unchanged. 
Output State: **The affected lists have been updated based on the bitwise OR operation between them.**
