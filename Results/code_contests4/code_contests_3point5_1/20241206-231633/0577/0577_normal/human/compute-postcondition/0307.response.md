Postcondition: ***`x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `answer` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute again. If `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated based on `fa[x]`, `nowChild[x] is incremented by 1, and `dep` is decremented by 1. If `nowChild[x] != lenChild[x]`, then `x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `answer` are adjusted for the loop to execute again, and `dep` is incremented by 1.***
