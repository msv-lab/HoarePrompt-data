Postcondition: ***Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the conditions for `j` and `ans[x][j]` in relation to `ans[fa[x]][j]` are maintained for the loop to execute one more time. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the cleared `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
