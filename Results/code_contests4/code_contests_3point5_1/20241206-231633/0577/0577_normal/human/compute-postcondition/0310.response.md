Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `dep`. It contains a while loop that iterates until `x` becomes -1. Within the loop, various conditions are checked and variables are updated accordingly. The behavior of the function seems to involve updating and manipulating data structures based on certain conditions, but the exact purpose or outcome of these manipulations is not clearly defined. The annotations mention the state of variables after the loop, but the specific functionality or return value of the function is not explicitly stated. It is unclear what the final goal or result of the function is based on the provided information.**
