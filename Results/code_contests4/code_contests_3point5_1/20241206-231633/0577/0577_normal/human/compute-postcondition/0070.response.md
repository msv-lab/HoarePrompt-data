Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the value at index `j` in `ans[x]`. After executing `ans[x][j].clear()`, the value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is cleared. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[x]`.
Output State: **The value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[x]**.
