Example Answer:
The value of `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `x` and `j` are used to access elements in the 2D array `ans`. The value of `fa[x]` is used to determine the row index from which to copy the value. Therefore, the new value of `ans[x][j]` is determined by the value at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **The loop executes one more time with updated values**
