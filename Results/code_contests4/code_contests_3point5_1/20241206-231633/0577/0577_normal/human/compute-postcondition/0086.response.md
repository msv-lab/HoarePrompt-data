Example Answer: 
The code clears the value at index `[fa[x]][j]` in the `ans` array. The loop executes one more time, updating the value at index `[x][j]` in the `ans` array with a bitwise OR operation with the value at index `[fa[x]][j]`. The previous values of variables are not mentioned, but after this operation, the value at index `[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.
Output State: **The value at index `[fa[x]][j]` in the `ans` array is cleared**
