Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All initial conditions remain true.
Output State: **All initial conditions remain true**
