Example Answer: 
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `query[x]`, `nowlistindex`, `i` remain unchanged. `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]] and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`.**
