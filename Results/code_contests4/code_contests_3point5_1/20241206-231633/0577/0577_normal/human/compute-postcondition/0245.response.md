Example Answer:
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The conditions for `j` and `ans[x][j]` in relation to `ans[fa[x]][j]` are maintained for the loop to execute one more time. After execution, the length of `ans[x]` will be equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.
Output State: **Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`**
