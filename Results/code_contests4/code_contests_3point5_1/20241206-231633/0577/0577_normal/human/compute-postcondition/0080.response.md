Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[x]`. The previous values of `ans[x][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `fa[x]`, and `x` are unknown, so the output state is: The value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[x]`.
Output State: **The value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is updated to be the bitwise OR of its current value and the cleared value at index `j` in `ans[x]**.
