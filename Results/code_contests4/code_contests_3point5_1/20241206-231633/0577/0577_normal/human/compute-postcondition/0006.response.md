Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`. The initial state tells us that `nowlistindex` is the value at index `x` in `ss`, and `query[x]` has elements in it. Therefore, `j` will be assigned the value at the next index after `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`. 
Output State: **`x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, `len(query[x])` is greater than 0, `i` is the value at index `nowlistindex` in the list `query[x]`, `j` is the value at index `nowlistindex + 1` in the list `query[x]`**
