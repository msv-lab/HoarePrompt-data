Postcondition: ***The final state after the loop executes will be that all the elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`. Additionally, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`***
