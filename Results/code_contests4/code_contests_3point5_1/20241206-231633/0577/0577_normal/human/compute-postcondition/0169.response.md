Example Answer:
The code clears the contents of the list located at `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The contents of the list are not specified, but after execution, the list will be empty. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, and the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, and the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.**
