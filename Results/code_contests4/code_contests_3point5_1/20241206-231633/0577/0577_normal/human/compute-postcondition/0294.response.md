Postcondition: ***`x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `query[x]`, `nowlistindex`, `i` remain unchanged. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]] and `ans[x][j]` is updated to the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]] and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`.***
