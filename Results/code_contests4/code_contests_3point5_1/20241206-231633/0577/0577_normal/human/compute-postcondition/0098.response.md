Example Answer:
`nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is now updated to the value of `fa[x]`, so `nowChild[fa[x]]` is actually incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is now updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`x` is now updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1**
