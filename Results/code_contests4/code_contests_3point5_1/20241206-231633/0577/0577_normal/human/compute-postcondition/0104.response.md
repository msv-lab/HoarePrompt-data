According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions need to be met for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then:
   - `x` should be updated to the value of `fa[x]`.
   - `nowChild[fa[x]]` should be incremented by 1.
   - `dep` should be decremented by 1.

2. If `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `dep` should be increased by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`x` is not equal to -1, if `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` should be updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` should be incremented by 1, and `dep` should be decremented by 1. Otherwise, `dep` should be increased by 1.**
