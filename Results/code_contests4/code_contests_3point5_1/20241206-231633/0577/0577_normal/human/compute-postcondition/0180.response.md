Example Answer: 
The code `ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` performs a bitwise OR operation between the lists `ans[fa[x]][j]` and `ans[x][j]`. The final state after this operation is that all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`. Additionally, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will remain unchanged.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`. The list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will be cleared if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Otherwise, the list at `ans[fa[x]][j]` will remain unchanged.**
