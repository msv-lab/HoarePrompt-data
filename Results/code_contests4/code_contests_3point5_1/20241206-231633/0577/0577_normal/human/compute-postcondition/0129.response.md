According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `ans[x]` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Additionally, after the if condition, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]`. So for the loop to execute, `ans[x]` must have at least 1 element and the length of `ans[x]` must be less than the length of `ans[fa[x]`. 
State: **All the elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`. After the if condition, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]` for the loop to execute the first time**
