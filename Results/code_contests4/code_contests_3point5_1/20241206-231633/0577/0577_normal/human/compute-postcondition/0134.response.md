Example Answer:
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with the value of `ans[x][j]`. The length of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[x][j]`, and `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]`. After the operation, the output state is: All the elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`.
Output State: **All the elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`**
