Postcondition: ***`x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `query[x]`, `nowlistindex`, `i` remain unchanged. `ans[x][dep]` is updated with `{ss[x]}`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, then if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the bitwise OR operation between the previous value of `ans[x][j]` and an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is cleared.***
