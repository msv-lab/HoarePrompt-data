Example Answer:
The code `ans[x][j].clear()` clears the list at index `j` in the list `ans[x]`. This means that all elements in the list at index `j` will be removed. As a result, after execution, all elements in the list at index `j` will be empty. Since the final state after the loop executes will be that all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, the Output State is: All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`.
Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`**
