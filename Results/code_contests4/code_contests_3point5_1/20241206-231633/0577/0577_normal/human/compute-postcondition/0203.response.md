Output State: **If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is incremented by 1, and `dep` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `dep` is increased by 1. If `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, `x` remains the same, `nowChild[fa[x]]` is not incremented, and `dep` is increased by 1**.
