Postcondition: ***The final state after the loop executes will be that all elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`. For the loop to execute the first time, `ans[fa[x]]` is not empty, and the lengths of `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]` satisfy the condition that the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[x]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
