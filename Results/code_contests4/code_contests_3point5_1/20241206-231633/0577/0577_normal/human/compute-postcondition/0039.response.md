Postcondition: ***All initial conditions remain true. If j is not in ans[fa[x]], then ans[fa[x]][j] is assigned the value of ans[x][j]. If j is in ans[fa[x]], then if the length of ans[x][j] is less than the length of ans[fa[x]][j], ans[fa[x]][j] is cleared. Otherwise, ans[x][j] is updated with the bitwise OR operation of ans[x][j] and ans[fa[x]][j].***
