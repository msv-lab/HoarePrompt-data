According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute again:
- If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, then:
    - `x` should be updated to the value of `fa[x]`.
    - `nowChild[fa[x]]` should be incremented by 1.
    - `dep` should be decremented by 1.
    - All elements in the `answer` list will be either 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`.
- If `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, then:
    - `dep` should be increased by 1.

State: **Adjust `x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `answer` based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute again**
