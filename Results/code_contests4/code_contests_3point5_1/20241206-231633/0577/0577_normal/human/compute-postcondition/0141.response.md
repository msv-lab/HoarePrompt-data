Postcondition: ***All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`. After the if condition, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]` for the loop to execute the first time. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, but the length of `ans[x][j]` is unknown. Otherwise, the element at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is updated with the element at index `j` in `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` remains greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`.***
