According to the code, the loop can execute if the query list at index `x` has a length greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0 ensures that the loop will execute. Also, the element at index `x` in both `nowChild` and `lenChild` lists should be equal. Moreover, `ans[x][dep]` being a set containing the value at index `x` in `ss` guarantees the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, and `len(query[x])` is greater than 0.
State: **`x` is not equal to -1 and not equal to 0, `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `ans[x][dep]` contains the value at index `x` in `ss`, `len(query[x])` is greater than 0**
