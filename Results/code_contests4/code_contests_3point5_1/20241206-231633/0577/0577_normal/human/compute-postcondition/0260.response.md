Postcondition: ***Before the loop, the length of `ans[x]` is equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, j is in `ans[fa[x]]`, and the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` becomes an empty list. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is updated by applying a bitwise OR operation with the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
