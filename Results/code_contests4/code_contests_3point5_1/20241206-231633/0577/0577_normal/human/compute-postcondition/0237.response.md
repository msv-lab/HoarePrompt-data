Output State: **Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. After the if condition, `len(ans[x][j])` is less than `len(ans[fa[x]][j])` and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated with the result of the bitwise OR operation between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. `ans[x][j]` is cleared.**
