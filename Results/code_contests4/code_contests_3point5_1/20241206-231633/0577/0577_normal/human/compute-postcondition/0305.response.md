Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. The values of `x` and `nowChild[x]` determine the new value of `x`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `answer` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute again. `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.
Output State: **`x`, `nowChild`, `fa`, `dep`, `answer` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute again. `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`.**
