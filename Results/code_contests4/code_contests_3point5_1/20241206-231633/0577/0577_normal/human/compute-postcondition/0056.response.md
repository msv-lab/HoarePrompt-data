Postcondition: ***All initial conditions remain true. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the function executes one set of instructions. Otherwise, if `ans[x][j]` is an empty list and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is an empty list, the function executes another set of instructions.***
