Output State: **All elements in the `answer` list will either be 0 or the length of the corresponding `ans[x][dep + i]`, depending on whether `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`. After executing the code, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`, but the length of `ans[x][j]` is unknown. Additionally, `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`.**
