Example Answer:
The bitwise OR operation is applied between `ans[x][j]` and `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is already greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, so the result is stored back in `ans[x][j]`. The lengths of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **Before the loop starts, the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. Additionally, the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]**
