Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly calculate the total distance traveled during delivery as described in the problem statement. The code is using a fixed value of 8 in the modulo operation, which is incorrect as the total length of the loop line (d) should be used instead. This will lead to incorrect calculations of the distance traveled from the nearest store to the delivery destination. 

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the delivery destination is the same as the location of a store, which should also be considered in the calculations.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
