Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input data as specified in the problem description, calculates the sum of distances traveled during delivery for each order, and writes the output to a file. It iterates over the delivery destination locations, finds the nearest store to each destination, calculates the distance traveled, and adds it to the total sum. The program follows the logic described in the problem and produces the correct output for each dataset.
