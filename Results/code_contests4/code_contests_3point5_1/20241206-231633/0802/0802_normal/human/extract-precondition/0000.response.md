**Precondition:**

- d is a positive integer such that 2 <= d <= 1000000000.
- n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000.
- m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10000.
- di, where i ranges from 2 to n, are integers representing the location of stores other than the main store, such that 1 <= di <= d - 1.
- ki, where i ranges from 1 to m, are integers representing the delivery destination location, such that 0 <= ki <= d.
- The input format is as described above.
