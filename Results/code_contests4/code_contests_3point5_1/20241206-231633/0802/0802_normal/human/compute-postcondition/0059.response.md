Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is converted to a string and written to the file object `f`. The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, and `K` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` file object for 'output.txt' is opened in write mode, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K` remain unchanged, and the sum of all `i` values calculated during the loop iterations is written to the file.
Output State: **`f` file object for 'output.txt' is opened in write mode, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K` remain unchanged, and the sum of all `i` values calculated during the loop iterations is written to the file**
