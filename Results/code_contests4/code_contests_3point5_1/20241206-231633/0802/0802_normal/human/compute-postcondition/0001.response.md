Example Answer:
The `input` variable is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element in the list generated by splitting the contents of file object `f`. Since the initial state did not specify the contents of the file, the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is the file object for 'input.txt' in read mode, `input` is a map object containing integer values.
Output State: **`f` is the file object for 'input.txt' in read mode, `input` is a map object containing integer values**
