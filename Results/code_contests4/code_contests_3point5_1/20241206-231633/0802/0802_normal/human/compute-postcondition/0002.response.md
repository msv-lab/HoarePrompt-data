Example Answer:
The `f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, and the file is no longer available for reading. The `input` map object containing integer values remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `input` is a map object containing integer values.
Output State: **`f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `input` is a map object containing integer values**
