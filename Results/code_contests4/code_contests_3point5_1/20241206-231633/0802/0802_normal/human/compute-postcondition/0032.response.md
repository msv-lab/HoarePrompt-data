Postcondition: ***`f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) is false and there are more elements in `K`. If ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) is true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
