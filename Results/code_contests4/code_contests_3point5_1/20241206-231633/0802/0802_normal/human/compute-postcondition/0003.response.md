Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the first element of `input`, `n` is assigned the second element of `input`, and `m` is assigned the third element of `input`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `input`, the output state will depend on the values stored in `input` during execution.
Output State: **`f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m` are assigned values from `input`**
