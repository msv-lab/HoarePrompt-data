According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `K`. If there are more elements in `K`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `i` remain unchanged, and `sum` is increased by the value of `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in `K`.
State: **`f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `i` remain unchanged, `sum` is increased by the value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in `K`**
