Postcondition: ***`f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `i`, `sum` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time there must be more elements in `K`, `i` is 1. If ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) is true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
