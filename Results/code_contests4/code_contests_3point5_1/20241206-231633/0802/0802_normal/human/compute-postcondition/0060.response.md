Example Answer:
The file object `f` for 'output.txt' is closed. No other variables are affected, so the Output State is: `f` file object for 'output.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K` remain unchanged, and the sum of all `i` values calculated during the loop iterations is written to the file.
Output State: **`f` file object for 'output.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K` remain unchanged, and the sum of all `i` values calculated during the loop iterations is written to the file**
