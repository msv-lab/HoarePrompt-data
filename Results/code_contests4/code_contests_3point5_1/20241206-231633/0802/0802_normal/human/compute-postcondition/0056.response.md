Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to `sum`, and `i` is adjusted to satisfy the condition ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) for the next iteration. If there are no more elements in `K`, `i` is set to the smallest integer value that satisfies the condition. The variables `f`, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged, `i` is adjusted to satisfy the condition for the next iteration.**
