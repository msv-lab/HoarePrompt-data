Functionality: ** The function reads input from 'input.txt', processes the data according to a specific logic involving sets and loops, calculates a sum based on the processed data, and writes the final sum to 'output.txt'. The logic involves iterating over a list of integers, finding specific conditions, and summing up certain values. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input and output files.**
