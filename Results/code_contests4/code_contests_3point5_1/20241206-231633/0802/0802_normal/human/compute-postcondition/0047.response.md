According to the code, the loop will execute indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, the program state needs to be repeated at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **Output State: `f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged. `i` is adjusted to satisfy ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) condition for the next iteration, and there are no more elements in `K`, `i` is set to 1.**
