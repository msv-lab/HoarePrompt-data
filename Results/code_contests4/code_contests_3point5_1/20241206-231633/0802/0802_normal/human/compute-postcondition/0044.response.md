Output State: `f` file object for 'input.txt' is closed, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K`, `sum` remain unchanged, `i` is adjusted to satisfy ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) condition for the next iteration, and there are no more elements in `K`, `i` is set to 1. Additionally, ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
