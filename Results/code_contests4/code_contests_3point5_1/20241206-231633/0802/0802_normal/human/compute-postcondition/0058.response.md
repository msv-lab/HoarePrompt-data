Example Answer:
The code opens a file object `f` for writing to 'output.txt'. Since the file is opened in write mode, the existing content of 'output.txt' will be overwritten. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` file object for 'output.txt' is opened in write mode, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K` remain unchanged. `sum` is the sum of all `i` values calculated during the loop iterations.
Output State: **`f` file object for 'output.txt' is opened in write mode, `d`, `n`, `m`, `S`, `K` remain unchanged. `sum` is the sum of all `i` values calculated during the loop iterations**
