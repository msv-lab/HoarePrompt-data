Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first takes input for the size of the permutation and the permutation itself.
2. Then it takes input for the binary matrix A and constructs the matrix.
3. It then iterates over the permutation and checks if swapping is possible based on the conditions given in the problem description.
4. If swapping is possible, it swaps the elements in the permutation.
5. Finally, it prints the prettiest permutation obtained after the swaps.

The program follows the problem description accurately and correctly implements the logic to determine the prettiest permutation that can be obtained. Each step aligns with the requirements described in the problem statement, and the code logic is sound.
