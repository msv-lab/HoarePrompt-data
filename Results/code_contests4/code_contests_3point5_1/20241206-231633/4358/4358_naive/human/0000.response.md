Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program reads the input, processes the permutation according to the rules described in the problem, and prints the prettiest permutation that can be obtained. The program iterates through all pairs of elements in the permutation and checks if a swap is possible based on the matrix A. It then performs the swap if conditions are met. The program repeats this process twice to ensure all possible swaps are considered. Finally, it outputs the prettiest permutation. The program follows the problem description accurately and there are no cases identified where it fails to produce the correct output.
