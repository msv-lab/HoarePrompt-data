**Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. The permutation p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n. The matrix A is a 2D list of characters '0' or '1' with dimensions n x n, where for all i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, A[i][j] = A[j][i] and for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, A[i][i] = '0' holds.**
