**Precondition:** 
- The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) representing the size of the permutation p.
- The next line contains n space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pn representing the permutation p where each integer between 1 and n occurs exactly once.
- Next n lines describe the matrix A. The i-th line contains n characters '0' or '1' representing the i-th row of A where Ai, j is the element on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of A.
- It is guaranteed that, for all integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, Ai, j = Aj, i holds.
- It is guaranteed that for all integers i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Ai, i = 0 holds.
