Output State: **`author` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is 4, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j']`. If `p[i] > p[j]` and `a[i][j] == 1` and `a[j][i] == 1`, then the program will maintain the initial state of the variables.**
