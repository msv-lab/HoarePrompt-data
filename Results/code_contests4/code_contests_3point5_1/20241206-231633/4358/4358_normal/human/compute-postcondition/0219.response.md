Postcondition: ***`author` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `p` is a map object where the value at index `i` is now equal to the value at index `j` for all `i` and `j` where `p[i]` > `p[j]`, `i` is 3, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is equal to `n`, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `n+1, `j` is 4, and the condition (p[i] > p[j]) is now true***
