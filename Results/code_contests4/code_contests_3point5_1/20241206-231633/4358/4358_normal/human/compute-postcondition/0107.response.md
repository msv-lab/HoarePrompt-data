Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is 3, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value.
Output State: **`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is 3, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value**
