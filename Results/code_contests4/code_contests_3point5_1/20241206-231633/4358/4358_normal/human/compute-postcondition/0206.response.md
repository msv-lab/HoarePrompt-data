Output State: **`author` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `p` is a map object where the value at index `i` is now equal to the value at index `j`, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n`, the value at index `i` in `p` is greater than the value at index `j` in `p`, `a[i][j]` is equal to 1, `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` in `p`, and `p[j]` is equal to `tmp` and for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n`, `tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` in `p`. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then the overall state of the program remains the same, `j` is incremented by 1.**
