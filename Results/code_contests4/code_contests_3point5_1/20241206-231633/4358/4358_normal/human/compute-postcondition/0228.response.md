Output State: **`author` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `p` is a map object where the value at index `i` is now equal to the value at index `j` for all `i` and `j` where `p[i]` > `p[j`, `i` is 3, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is equal to `n`, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `n+1`, `j` is less than `n`, if the condition (p[i] > p[j]) is true, then the elements at index `i` and `j` of the lists inside `a` are both equal to 1, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. Finally, `p[i]` is now equal to the value of `p[j`. `j` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i`**
