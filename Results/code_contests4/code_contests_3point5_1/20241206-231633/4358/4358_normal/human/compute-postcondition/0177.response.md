Postcondition: ***`author` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is 2, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j']`. If `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then the program maintains the initial state without any changes.***
