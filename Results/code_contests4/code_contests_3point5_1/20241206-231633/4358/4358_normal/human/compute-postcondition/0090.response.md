According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to the length of the last input string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n`, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and the condition `(p[i] > p[j])` is true. If `a[i][j] == 1` and `a[j][i] == 1`, then after the execution, `p[i]` is equal to the value of `p[j]` and `p[j]` is equal to the value of `tmp`, where `tmp` is the initial value of `p[i]`.**
