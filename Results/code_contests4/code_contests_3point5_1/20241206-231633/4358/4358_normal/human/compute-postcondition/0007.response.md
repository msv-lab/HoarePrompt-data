Example Answer:
`b` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object that contains the input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty list.
Output State: **`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object that contains the input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty list**
