Postcondition: ***'author' is 'RASULBEK', 'n' is a positive integer greater than 3, 'p' is a map object satisfying the condition, 'i' is 3, 'a' is updated, 'j' is less than 'n+1', 'b' is updated, 's' is assigned, 'i' is less than 'n+1', 'j' is less than 'n', 'j' is less than 'n+1' for the loop to execute one more time, 'tmp' is assigned the value of p[3], 'p[i] = p[j]', 'p[j] = tmp' where the value of 'j' is less than 'n+1' is executed, if a[i][j] == 1 and a[j][i] == 1, then 'p[i]' will equal 'p[j]' and 'p[j]' will equal 'tmp' where 'tmp' is the value of 'p[3]' after the execution of the if statement.***
