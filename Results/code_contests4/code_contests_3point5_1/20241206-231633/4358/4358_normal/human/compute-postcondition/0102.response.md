Postcondition: ***`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n`, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and the condition `(p[i] > p[j])` is true, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n+1`. If `a[i][j] == 1` and `a[j][i] == 1`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and the program continues to execute within the loop conditions.***
