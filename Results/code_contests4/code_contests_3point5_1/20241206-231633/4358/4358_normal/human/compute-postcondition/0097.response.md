According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. Additionally, `p[i] > p[j]` needs to be true for the loop to execute. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n`, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and the condition `(p[i] > p[j])` is true, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `n+1`.**
