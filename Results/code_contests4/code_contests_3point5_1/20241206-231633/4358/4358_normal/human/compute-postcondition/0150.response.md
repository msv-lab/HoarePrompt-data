Output State: **`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 4, `a` is a list containing lists of 1's and 0's based on the input strings, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `b` is a list containing the sequence of 1's and 0's based on the last input string `s`, `s` is assigned the last input string value, `p[i]` is equal to `p[j]`, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be less than `n`, `p[i]` is greater than `p[j`, `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`, and `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp` after the execution of the if else block.**
