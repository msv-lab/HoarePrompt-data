According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input value. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be a positive integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object that contains the input values converted to integers, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list**
