Postcondition: ***`__author__` is 'RASULBEK', `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a map object containing input values converted to integers, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing the values of list `b` appended to it, `j` is 1, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the condition, `s` is assigned the input string value, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than the length of string `s`. If `s[j]` is equal to '1', then the value 1 is appended to list `b`. Otherwise, the value 0 is appended to list `b`.***
