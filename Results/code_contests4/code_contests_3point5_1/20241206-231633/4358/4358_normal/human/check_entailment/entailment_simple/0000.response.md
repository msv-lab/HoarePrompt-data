Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, checks the conditions based on the binary matrix A, and swaps the elements in the permutation p accordingly. Finally, it outputs the prettiest permutation that can be obtained. The program uses loops to iterate over the permutations and binary matrix efficiently. The logic presented in the program aligns with the problem requirements, ensuring that the final output meets the criteria for a prettiest permutation.
