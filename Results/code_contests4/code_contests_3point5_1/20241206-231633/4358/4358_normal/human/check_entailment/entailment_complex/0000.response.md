Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue lies in the swapping mechanism. The program swaps the elements of the permutation `p` based on the conditions specified by the matrix `a`, but it does not ensure that the prettiest permutation is obtained.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that the prettier permutation should have the property where there exists an integer `k` such that `a1 = b1, a2 = b2, ..., ak - 1 = bk - 1 and ak < bk` all hold. However, the program only swaps elements based on the condition `a[i][j] == 1 and a[j][i] == 1`, without considering the prettiness condition.

Therefore, the program does not guarantee that the output will always be the prettiest permutation that can be obtained. It may swap elements incorrectly, leading to an incorrect output.
