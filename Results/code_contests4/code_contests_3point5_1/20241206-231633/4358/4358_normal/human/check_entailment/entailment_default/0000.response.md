Correctness: **True**

The code reads the input values correctly, processes them according to the problem description, and prints the prettiest permutation that can be obtained. It iterates through the permutation and checks if swapping is possible based on the binary matrix A. The swapping logic is implemented correctly, and the final output matches the expected output. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
