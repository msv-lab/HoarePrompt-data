Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. It only checks if a number can be represented as a power of 3. However, the problem requires sorting a deck of cards by splitting and reversing the order of parts of the deck. The program does not address this requirement at all. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description for any potential case.
