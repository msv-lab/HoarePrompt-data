Example Answer: 
The value of `sq` is directly assigned as True. The values of `n` and `i` are not altered by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52, `i` is multiplied by 3, `sq` is True if `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the current value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52, `i` is multiplied by 3, `sq` is True if `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the current value of `i`**
