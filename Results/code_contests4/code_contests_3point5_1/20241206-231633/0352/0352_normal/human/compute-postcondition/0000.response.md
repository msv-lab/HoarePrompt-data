Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is between 1 and 52 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52**
