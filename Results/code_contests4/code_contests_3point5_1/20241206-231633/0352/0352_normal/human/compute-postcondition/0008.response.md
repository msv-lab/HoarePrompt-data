According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is multiplied by 3 and `sq` is True if `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than the current value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52, `i` is multiplied by 3, `sq` is True if `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the current value of `i`**
