Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52. `i` is multiplied by 3. `sq` is True if `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If `i` is equal to `n`, the program executes as described. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
