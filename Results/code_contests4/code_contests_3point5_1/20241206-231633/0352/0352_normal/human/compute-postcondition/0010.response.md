Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52, `i` is multiplied by 3, `sq` is True if `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the current value of `i`. If `i` is equal to `n`, then `sq` is True. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, and `sq` remain unchanged.***
