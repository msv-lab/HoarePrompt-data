Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program does not solve the problem described in the problem description. The program asks for an integer input `n`, but it does not handle the input deck of cards as described in the problem.

The program does not implement the operations required to sort the deck of cards by splitting the deck into k nonempty contiguous parts and then reversing the order of the parts.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
