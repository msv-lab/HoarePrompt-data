Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not solve the problem described in the problem description. The program simply checks if the smallest power of 3 greater than the input number is equal to the input number and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This is not related to the problem of sorting the deck of cards as described in the problem description.

The program does not implement the deck sorting algorithm described in the problem. It does not split the deck into contiguous parts and reverse their order to sort the deck using at most n operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this problem.
