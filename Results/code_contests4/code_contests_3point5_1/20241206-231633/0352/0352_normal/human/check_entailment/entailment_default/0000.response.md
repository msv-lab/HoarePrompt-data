Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an integer input `n` representing the number of cards in the deck and then checks if the smallest power of 3 greater than `n` is equal to `n`. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. The code seems to follow the problem description as it correctly determines if a valid sorting operation can be performed on the deck of cards. It handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the code is correct for the given problem. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
