Postcondition: ***xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100. ya is less than yb. ya is equal to yb. If xa is not equal to xc or ya + yc is not equal to yb, then the program executes the else block. In this case, ya is equal to yc and the sum of xa, xb, and xc is equal to yc.***
