Postcondition: ***xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100 and ya is less than yb. If ya is equal to yb, then the program executes the if block with (xa == xb) condition. Additionally, after entering the if block, ya is equal to yb. In addition, xc is equal to xa and ya + yb + yc is equal to xa***.
