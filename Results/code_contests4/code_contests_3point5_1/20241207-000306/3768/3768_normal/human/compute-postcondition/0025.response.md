Postcondition: ***xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100 and ya is less than yb. If ya is equal to yb, then the program continues with the given conditions. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if block. Additionally, after not entering the if block, ya is greater than yb.***
