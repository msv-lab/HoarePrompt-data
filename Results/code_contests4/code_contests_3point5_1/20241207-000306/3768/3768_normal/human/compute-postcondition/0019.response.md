Postcondition: ***xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 â‰¤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc â‰¤ 100 and ya is less than yb. If ya is equal to yb, then the program continues with the given conditions. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if block. In addition, after entering the if condition (ya > yb), ya is greater than yb.***
