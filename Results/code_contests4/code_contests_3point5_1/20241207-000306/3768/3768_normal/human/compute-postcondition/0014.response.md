Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `yc`. Based on the initial state given, it is mentioned that `ya` is equal to `yc`, and the sum of `xa`, `xb`, and `xc` is equal to `yc`. Therefore, the value of `yc` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. 
Output State: **`yc` is a positive integer between 1 and 100**
