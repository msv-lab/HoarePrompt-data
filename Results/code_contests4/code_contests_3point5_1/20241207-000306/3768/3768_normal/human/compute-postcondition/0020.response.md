Postcondition: ***xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc are positive integers such that 1 ≤ xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc ≤ 100 and ya is less than yb. If ya is equal to yb, then the program continues with the given conditions. After entering the if condition (ya > yb) and (xb == xc and yb + yc == ya), ya is greater than yb.***
