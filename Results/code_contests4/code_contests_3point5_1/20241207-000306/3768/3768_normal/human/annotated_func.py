#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts positive integer parameters `xa, ya, xb, yb, xc, yc` within the range of 1 to 100. It has multiple return points where it returns True in Cases 1 to 5 and returns False in Case 6. The function determines certain conditions based on the input parameters and returns True or False accordingly.
