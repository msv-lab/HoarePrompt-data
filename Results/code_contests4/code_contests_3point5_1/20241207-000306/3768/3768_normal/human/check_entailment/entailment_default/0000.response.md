Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code takes in the dimensions of the logos of three companies and then checks multiple conditions to determine if it is possible to place all three logos on a square billboard without overlapping and without any empty space left. 
2. The function `func_1` evaluates different scenarios based on the dimensions of the logos provided as input parameters and returns True if a valid configuration is found, otherwise it returns False.
3. The code handles different cases where the logos can be placed in a square billboard without overlapping and without empty space, ensuring that the rules described in the problem statement are followed.
4. The output matches the problem description by either printing the length of the side of the square billboard or -1 if it is impossible to place all three logos.
