You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Three companies decided to order a billboard with pictures of their logos. A billboard is a big square board. A logo of each company is a rectangle of a non-zero area. 

Advertisers will put up the ad only if it is possible to place all three logos on the billboard so that they do not overlap and the billboard has no empty space left. When you put a logo on the billboard, you should rotate it so that the sides were parallel to the sides of the billboard.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to put the logos of all the three companies on some square billboard without breaking any of the described rules.

Input

The first line of the input contains six positive integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 (1 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ≤ 100), where xi and yi determine the length and width of the logo of the i-th company respectively.

Output

If it is impossible to place all the three logos on a square shield, print a single integer "-1" (without the quotes).

If it is possible, print in the first line the length of a side of square n, where you can place all the three logos. Each of the next n lines should contain n uppercase English letters "A", "B" or "C". The sets of the same letters should form solid rectangles, provided that:

  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "A" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the first company, 
  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "B" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the second company, 
  * the sizes of the rectangle composed from letters "C" should be equal to the sizes of the logo of the third company, 



Note that the logos of the companies can be rotated for printing on the billboard. The billboard mustn't have any empty space. If a square billboard can be filled with the logos in multiple ways, you are allowed to print any of them.

See the samples to better understand the statement.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
