Explanation: The program considers all possible cases where the logos of the three companies can be fit onto a square billboard without overlapping and without leaving empty spaces. It checks for different combinations of sizes and positions of the logos to ensure that all requirements are met. The program also allows for the logos to be rotated if necessary to fit onto the square billboard. Overall, the logic in the program seems to cover all possible scenarios as per the problem description.
