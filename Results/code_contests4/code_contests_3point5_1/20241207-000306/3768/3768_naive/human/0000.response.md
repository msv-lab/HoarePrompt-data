Explanation: The program correctly handles all possible cases where it is possible to put the logos of all three companies on a square billboard without breaking any rules. The program covers different scenarios by considering all possible combinations of the lengths and widths of the logos for each company. It checks if the logos can fit on a square billboard without overlapping or leaving empty spaces and prints the correct output accordingly. Since the program considers all possible cases and provides the correct output for each, it can be considered correct.
