Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0, 1, or 2. `hand` is modified based on the elements in `str` and the conditions met in the if and else parts. If `hand` is empty, then it is modified by adding the element at index `i` of `str`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 0, and `hand` has elements other than 0. If `str[i]` is equal to the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` can be 1 or 2, `hand` is updated according to `str`, `i` is reset to 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `hand` has elements other than 0, and `hand` now contains the element at index `i` of the `str` list.***
