According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. 
Before the loop starts, `count` is 0 and `hand` is an empty list. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` should be 0.
State: **`count` is 0, `hand` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
