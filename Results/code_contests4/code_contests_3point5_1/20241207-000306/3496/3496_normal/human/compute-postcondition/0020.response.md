Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `hand` is modified according to the conditions based on the elements in `str`, `i` is 0, `n` stays greater than 0, and `hand` list has elements other than 0. If `str[i]` is equal to the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then the state remains the same. Otherwise, `count` is either 1 or 2, `hand` is modified according to the conditions based on the elements in `str`, `i` is 0, `n` stays greater than 0, `hand` list has elements other than 0, and `hand` now contains the element at index `i` of the `str` list.***
