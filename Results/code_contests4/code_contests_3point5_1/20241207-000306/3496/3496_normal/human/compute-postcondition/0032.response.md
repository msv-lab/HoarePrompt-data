Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input string that only contains the letters "C" and "P" with a maximum length of 100 characters. It then processes the string based on certain conditions, counting the number of times these conditions are not met. The function does not return any value but prints the final count after processing the string. The function handles cases where the input string is empty, or where the conditions are met repeatedly, ensuring accurate count calculation. **
