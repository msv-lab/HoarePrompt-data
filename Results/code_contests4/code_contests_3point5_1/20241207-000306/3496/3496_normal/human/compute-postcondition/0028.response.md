Postcondition: ***`count` is either 1, 2, or 3. If `hand` is empty, it is updated with the element at index 0 of `str`, `i` is reset to 0, `n` remains greater than 0. If `hand` is not empty, depending on whether `str[i]` is equal to the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand`, `hand` is updated accordingly, `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 0.***
