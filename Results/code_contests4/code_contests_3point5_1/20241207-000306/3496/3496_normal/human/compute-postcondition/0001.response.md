Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the input string. Since the input string consists of only the letters "C" and "P", the length of the string can be any value from 0 to 100. Therefore, the Output State is: The input string consists of only the letters "C" and "P", the length of the string can be any value from 0 to 100.
Output State: **The input string consists of only the letters "C" and "P", the length of the string can be any value from 0 to 100**
