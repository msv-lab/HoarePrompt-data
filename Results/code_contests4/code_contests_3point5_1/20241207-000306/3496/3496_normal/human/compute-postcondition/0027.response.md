Postcondition: ***`count` is either 1, 2, or 3. If `str[i]` is equal to the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, `hand` is updated with the addition of `str[i]`, `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0. If `str[i]` is not equal to the last element of `hand` or the length of `hand` is not less than 5, `count` is either 2 or 3, `hand` is updated according to `str`, `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0, and `hand` contains the element at index 0 of the `str` list.***
