Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description correctly. It iterates through the input string and keeps track of the objects in hand. It only adds objects to hand if they are the same type and the hand does not exceed 5 items. If a different type of object is encountered or the hand is full, it increments the count of visits to the closet. The program then prints the count of visits to the closet at the end, which is the minimum number of times Polycarpus has to visit the closet. This logic aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
