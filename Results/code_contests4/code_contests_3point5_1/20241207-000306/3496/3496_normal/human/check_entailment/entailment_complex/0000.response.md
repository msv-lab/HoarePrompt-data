Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the input string, keeping track of the current items in hand and counting the number of times the conditions are not met. It ensures that Polycarpus can only carry up to 5 items of the same type before visiting the closet. The final count is printed as the minimum number of times Polycarpus has to visit the closet.

The program handles all cases where Polycarpus needs to visit the closet based on the given conditions. It correctly determines the minimum number of visits required to move all postcards and photos to the closet without mixing different types of items. Hence, the program is correct.
