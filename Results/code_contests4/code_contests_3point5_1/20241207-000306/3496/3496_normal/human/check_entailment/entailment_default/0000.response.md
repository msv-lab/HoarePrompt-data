Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not handle the case where the number of items in a sequence exceeds 5 and Polycarpus needs to make multiple trips to the closet. For example, if the input string is "CCCCCCPPPPPPPPPPPP", the code will output 3 instead of the correct answer of 6. This is because the code only checks for the last item and not the total count of items in a sequence. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all scenarios as described in the problem.
