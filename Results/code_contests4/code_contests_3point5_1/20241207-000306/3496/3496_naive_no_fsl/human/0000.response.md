Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through the input string, keeping track of the objects in hand and counting the number of times Polycarpus visits the closet. The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the problem description. It ensures that Polycarpus does not carry objects of two different types simultaneously and that he cannot carry more than 5 items at a time. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of times Polycarpus needs to visit the closet. Additionally, the program handles all edge cases such as when the input string is empty or contains only one type of object. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and hence, the correctness is True.
