Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not handle the case where Polycarpus has to carry both postcards and photos consecutively due to the limitation of carrying only 5 items. 

For example, for the input "CPPCPPCPPP" the expected output should be 5, but the program will output 4. This is because the program does not consider the fact that Polycarpus cannot carry more than 5 items, so he will have to make an extra trip to the closet.
