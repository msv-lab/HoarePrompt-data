Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for n, k, and the array of integers.
2. It correctly calculates the number of subarrays that have at least k equal numbers.
3. The program handles the case where k is equal to 1 separately and calculates the count accordingly.
4. The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the indices where each value occurs in the array and updates the count based on the leftmost index of the subarray.
5. The final count is calculated and printed as the output.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
