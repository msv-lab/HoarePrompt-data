Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the number of subarrays of the array 'a' that have at least 'k' equal integers. It first reads the input values for 'n', 'k', and the array 'a'. Then, it checks if 'k' is equal to 1, in which case it calculates the total number of subarrays containing exactly one equal number. 
For 'k' greater than 1, the program maintains a dictionary 'd' to store the indices of elements encountered so far. It iterates through the elements of 'a' and updates the dictionary with the index of each element. If the element is already present in the dictionary, it checks if the number of occurrences of that element is at least 'k'. If so, it updates the 'leftmost' index to the last occurrence of the element that satisfies the condition. 
Finally, the program calculates the count by adding the 'leftmost' index + 1 for each element in the array.
Since the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
