Example Answer:
The variable `count` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input. k is not equal to 1, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input. k is not equal to 1, `count` is 0**
