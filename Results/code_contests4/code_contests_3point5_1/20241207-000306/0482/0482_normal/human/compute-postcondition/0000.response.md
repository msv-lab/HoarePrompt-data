Example Answer:
The variable `debug` is assigned the value 'DEBUG' if it is present in the environment variables accessed through `os.environ`. The presence of 'DEBUG' in the environment variables is not known from the initial state provided. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5. The array a contains positive integers with elements ranging from 1 to 10^9.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5. The array a contains positive integers with elements ranging from 1 to 10^9.**
