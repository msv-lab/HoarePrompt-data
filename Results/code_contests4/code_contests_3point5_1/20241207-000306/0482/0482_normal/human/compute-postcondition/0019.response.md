Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, the dictionary `d` contains the key `val` with a list `[i]`, `leftmost` is equal to the value of `dvalk`, `i` remains 0, `val` remains the first element in `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of the element at index `-k` in `dval`, and `dvalk` is greater than `leftmost` after the if else block executes.***
