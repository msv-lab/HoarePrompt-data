Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 more element, `count` is incremented by `leftmost + 1`, `d` is updated with the new key `val` and value `[i+1]`, `leftmost` is updated based on the condition, `i` is increased by 1, `val` is the next element in `vals`, and if `len(dval) < k` then the program state remains the same. If `len(dval) >= k`, then `leftmost` is updated to the value of the k-th last element in `dval`. If `dval[k]` is greater than `leftmost`, the program state remains the same.***
