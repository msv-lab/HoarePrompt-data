Example Answer:
`dvalk` is assigned the value of the element at index `-k` in the list `dval`. Since the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, this operation is valid. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, the dictionary `d` now contains the key `val` with a list `[i]`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` remains 0, `val` remains the first element in `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of the element at index `-k` in `dval`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, the dictionary `d` now contains the key `val` with a list `[i]`, `leftmost` is -1, `i` remains 0, `val` remains the first element in `vals`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of the element at index `-k` in `dval`**
