Example Answer:
`vals` is assigned the values from input after converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The number of values assigned to `vals` is determined by `n`, which is a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input**
