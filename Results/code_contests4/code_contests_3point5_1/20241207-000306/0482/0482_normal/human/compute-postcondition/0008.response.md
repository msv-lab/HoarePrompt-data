Example Answer:
`leftmost` is assigned the value -1. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input. k is not equal to 1, `count` is 0 and an empty dictionary `d` is created, `leftmost` is -1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input. k is not equal to 1, `count` is 0 and an empty dictionary `d` is created, `leftmost` is -1**
