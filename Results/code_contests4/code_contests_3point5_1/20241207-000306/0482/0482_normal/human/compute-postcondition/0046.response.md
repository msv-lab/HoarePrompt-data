Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by the value of `leftmost + 1`. The value of `leftmost` depends on the conditions mentioned above, so it may change accordingly. The rest of the variables remain the same unless explicitly stated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 more element, `count` is incremented by `leftmost + 1`, `d` is updated with the new key `val` and value `[i+1]`, `leftmost` is updated based on the condition, `i` is increased by 1, `val` is the next element in `vals`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 more element, `count` is incremented by `leftmost + 1`, `d` is updated with the new key `val` and value `[i+1]`, `leftmost` is updated based on the condition, `i` is increased by 1, `val` is the next element in `vals`**
