According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `vals` list. Since `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input, we need to ensure that it has at least 1 element for the loop to execute. 

Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, an empty dictionary `d` is created, `leftmost` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `val` is the first element in `vals`**
