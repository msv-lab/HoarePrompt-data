Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is incremented by `leftmost + 1`, `d` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `[i]`, `leftmost` is -1 or the value of `d[val][-k]` based on the condition, `i` is increased by 1, `val` is the next element in `vals`, `d[val]` contains a list `[i+1]`, `dval` is assigned the value of `d[val]`, `dval[-k]` is assigned the value of the element at index `-k` in `dval`. If `val` is in `d`, the program checks the length of `dval`. If `len(dval) < k`, the program leaves the state unchanged. If `len(dval) >= k`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]` and `leftmost` is updated to `dvalk`. If `val` is not in `d`, the program leaves the state unchanged.***
