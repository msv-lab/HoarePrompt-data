Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers with at least 1 more element, `count` is incremented by `leftmost + 1`, `d` is updated with the new key `val` and value `[i+1]`, `leftmost` is updated based on the condition, `i` is increased by 1, `val` is the next element in `vals`, `dval` is assigned the new value of `d[val]`, `dvalk` is assigned the value of `dval[-k]`, if `len(dval) >= k` then `leftmost` is updated to `dvalk`.**
