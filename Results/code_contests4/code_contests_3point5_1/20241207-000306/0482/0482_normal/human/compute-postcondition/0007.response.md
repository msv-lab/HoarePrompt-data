Example Answer:
The dictionary `d` is initialized as empty. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input. k is not equal to 1, `count` is 0 and an empty dictionary `d` is created.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `vals` is a list of integers taken from the input. k is not equal to 1, `count` is 0 and an empty dictionary `d` is created**
