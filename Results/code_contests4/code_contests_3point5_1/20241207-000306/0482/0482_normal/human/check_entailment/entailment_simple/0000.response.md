Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the number of subarrays of the array `a` that have at least `k` equal integers. The program uses a dictionary `d` to keep track of the indices of the elements in the array and efficiently finds the leftmost occurrence of the `k-th` last occurrence of a value in the array. The final count is calculated based on this information and the output matches the expected number of subarrays with at least `k` equal integers.
