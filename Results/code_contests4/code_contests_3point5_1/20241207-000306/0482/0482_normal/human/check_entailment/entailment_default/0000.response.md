Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values of `n` and `k` and the array `vals`.
- It handles the case when `k` is equal to 1 by calculating `count` as the sum of integers from 1 to `n`.
- For `k` greater than 1, it iterates through the elements in `vals`, maintains a dictionary `d` to store indices of each element, and updates the `count` based on certain conditions.
- The code correctly calculates the number of subarrays that have at least `k` equal integers as required by the problem description.
- There are no identified edge cases where the code does not match the problem description.
