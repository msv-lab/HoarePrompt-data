Correctness: **False**

For the given program, there is a potential case where the program does not work as expected. Consider the following input:

Input:
3
999

In this case, the smallest number greater than 999 that can be written with period L = 3 is 1001. However, the program will output 1110 which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
