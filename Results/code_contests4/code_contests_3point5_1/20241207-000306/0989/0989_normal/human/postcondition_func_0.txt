The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the standard input. If the length of `s` is not divisible by `n`, it prints a string consisting of '1' followed by '0's repeated enough times. If the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, it checks if the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's. If they are, it prints a string of '9's with the length of `s`. If not, it modifies `s` based on certain conditions and prints the result. The function does not have a return value.
