Example Answer:
The string `tem` is created by concatenating '1' followed by '0's to make its length equal to `n`. The value of `tem` is not directly used in the print statement. The print statement outputs the repetition of `tem` for `(len(s) // n + 1)` times. Since the length of `s` is not divisible by `n`, there will be an additional repetition of `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by '0's, and the result of print statement.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by '0's, and the result of print statement**
