Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin. The length of `s` is divisible by `n`, the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9's. `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s`, `i` is `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time. The `i-th` character of `tem` is not '9'***
