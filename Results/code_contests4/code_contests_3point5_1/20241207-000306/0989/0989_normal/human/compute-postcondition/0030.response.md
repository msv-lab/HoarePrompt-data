Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin. If the length of `s` is not divisible by `n`, `tem` is a string consisting of '1' followed by '0's, and the result of the print statement. If the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, and the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, the code prints a string of '9's with the same length as `s`. Otherwise, if the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` all set to '0', `ans2` is a string of '0's repeated `len(s) // n` times, and either `ans1` or `ans2` is printed based on the comparison with `s`.***
