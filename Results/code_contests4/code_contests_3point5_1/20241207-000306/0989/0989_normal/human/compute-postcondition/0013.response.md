Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` where the `i-th` character has been incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
