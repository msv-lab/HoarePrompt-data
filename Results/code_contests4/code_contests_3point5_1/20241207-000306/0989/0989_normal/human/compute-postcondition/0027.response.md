Example Answer:
`ans2` is assigned the value of `tem` repeated `len(s) // n` times. Since `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` all set to '0', `ans2` will be a string consisting of '0's repeated `len(s) // n` times. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` all set to '0', `ans2` is a string of '0's repeated `len(s) // n` times.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9's, `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` all set to '0', `ans2` is a string of '0's repeated `len(s) // n` times**
