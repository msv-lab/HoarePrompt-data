Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9's, `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` where the `i-th` character has been incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `tem[i]` is '0' for the loop to execute one more time. If `tem[i]` is not '9', then `tem[i]` will be '1' after the loop execution.***
