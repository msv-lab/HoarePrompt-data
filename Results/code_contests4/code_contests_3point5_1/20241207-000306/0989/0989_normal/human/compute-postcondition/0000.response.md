Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. `s` is assigned the value of `stdin.readline().strip()`. The output state is `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin**
