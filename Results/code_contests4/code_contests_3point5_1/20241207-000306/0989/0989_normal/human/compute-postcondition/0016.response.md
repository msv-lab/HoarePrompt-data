According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9's, `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` where the `i-th` character has been incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `tem[i]` is '0'. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 2`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input from stdin, the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9's, `ans1` contains the first `n` characters of `s` repeated `len(s) // n` times, `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` where the `i-th` character has been incremented by 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `tem[i]` is '0' for the loop to execute one more time**
