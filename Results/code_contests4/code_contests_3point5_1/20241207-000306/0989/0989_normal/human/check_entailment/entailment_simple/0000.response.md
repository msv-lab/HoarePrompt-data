Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the smallest integer number X that is periodic with length L and greater than A. It handles the cases where the length of the input number is divisible by the period length L and where it is not. It also correctly handles the cases where the first n characters of the input number are all '9's. The logic in the program ensures that the output meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
