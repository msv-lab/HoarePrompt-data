#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 25.**
def func():
    print[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0][input() - 10]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for an input within the range of 10 to 25 (inclusive), then prints the corresponding value from a predefined list. The function does not handle inputs outside the specified range, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if input falls outside the expected range.
