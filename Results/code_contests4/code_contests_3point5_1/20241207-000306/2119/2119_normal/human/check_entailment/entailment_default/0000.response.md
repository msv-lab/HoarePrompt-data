Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided is a concise way to calculate the number of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades. The code uses a predefined list to directly access the number of ways based on the input value. The list seems to be correctly populated with the appropriate values for each potential sum of points. The code is simple and efficient in handling the given problem description for all potential cases. The code directly maps the input value to the correct output value based on the predefined list, ensuring that the correct result is returned for each valid input. The output hints do not provide any counterexamples or edge cases where the code might fail, and they align with the code's functionality. Hence, considering all of these points, the code is correct for the given problem description.
