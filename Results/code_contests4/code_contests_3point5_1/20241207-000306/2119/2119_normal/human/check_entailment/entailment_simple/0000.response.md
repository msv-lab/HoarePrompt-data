Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it takes an input 'n' representing the required sum of points, subtracts 10 from it (since the first card is the queen of spades), and then prints the corresponding value from the list [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This list represents the number of ways to get the second card in the required way based on the input sum of points. The program correctly handles all possible cases within the specified range of 1 to 25 and outputs the correct number of ways to achieve the desired sum of points.
