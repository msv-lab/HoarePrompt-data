Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it takes an input within the range of 10 to 25 (inclusive), which aligns with the problem description. The predefined list used in the program corresponds to the number of ways to get the second card that would make the sum of points exactly equal to the input value. The program correctly calculates and prints the desired output based on the input value provided. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for every potential case.
