Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value at the index corresponding to the input value minus 10 in the given list. Since the input is constrained to be between 1 and 25, the valid indices in the list are from 0 to 15. Therefore, the output value will be the value at the index calculated by input - 10 in the list [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
Output State: **The value from the list at the calculated index based on the input value is printed.**
