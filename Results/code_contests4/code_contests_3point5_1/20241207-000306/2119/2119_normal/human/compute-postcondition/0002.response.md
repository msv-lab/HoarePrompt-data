Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for an input within the range of 10 to 25 (inclusive), then prints the corresponding value from a predefined list. The function does not handle inputs outside the specified range, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if input falls outside the expected range. **
