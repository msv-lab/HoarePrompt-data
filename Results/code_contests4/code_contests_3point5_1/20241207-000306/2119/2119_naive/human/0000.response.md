Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program is a direct lookup table that provides the output based on the input value. The input value is subtracted by 10 and the corresponding value in the list is returned. All the possible cases for the sum of points have been pre-calculated and stored in the list. Since there is no logic or calculation involved in the program, and all the cases have been correctly pre-calculated, the program will provide the correct output for all possible inputs in the given range, making it correct.
