The function reads input values for N, M, C, and arrays B and A. It then iterates N times, calculating products of elements from A and B, checking if the sum of these products plus C is greater than 0, and increments the answer accordingly. Finally, it prints the total count of iterations where the sum condition is met. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
