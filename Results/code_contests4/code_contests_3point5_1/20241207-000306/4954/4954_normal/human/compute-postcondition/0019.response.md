Output State: **`N`, `M`, `C`, `B`, `i`, `A`, `tmp`, and `ans` are integers or map objects as described in the precondition. The loop will execute `N` times. At each iteration, `A` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to the inputs obtained from `raw_input().split()`. `tmp` is a list comprehension of products of elements from `A` and `B`. If the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
