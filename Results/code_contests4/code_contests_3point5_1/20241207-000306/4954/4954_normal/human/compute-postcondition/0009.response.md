According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `C`, `B`, `i`, `A`, `tmp` are integers or map objects as described in the precondition. If the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `C`, `B`, `i` is incremented by 1, `A`, `tmp` are integers or map objects as described in the precondition and if the sum of `tmp` plus `C` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1**
