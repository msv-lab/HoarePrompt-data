Postcondition: ***`N, M, C, B, i` are all incremented by 1. `A` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to the inputs obtained from `raw_input().split()`. `tmp` is a list of products of elements from `A` and `B` with a length of `M+1`. `ans` is incremented by 1 if the sum of `tmp` and `C` is greater than 0.***
