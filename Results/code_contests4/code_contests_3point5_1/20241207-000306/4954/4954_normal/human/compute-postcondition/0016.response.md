Example Answer:
The list comprehension calculates the products of elements from list `A` and list `B` for each corresponding index `m`. The previous values of `A` and `B` are the results of mapping `int` to the inputs obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The length of `A` and `B` is `N` and `M` respectively. If `N` and `M` are both incremented by 1, the new length of `A` and `B` will be `N+1` and `M+1`. Therefore, `tmp` will be a list of products with a length of `M+1`. The other variables `C`, `B`, `i`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet. If the sum of `tmp` and `C` is greater than 0, `ans` will be incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`N, M, C, B, i` are all incremented by 1. `A` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to the inputs obtained from `raw_input().split()`. `tmp` is a list of products of elements from `A` and `B` with a length of `M+1`. `ans` is incremented by 1 if the sum of `tmp` and `C` is greater than 0.**
