Correctness: False

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It does not handle the case where there are multiple consecutive '/' characters in the input path. The program only looks for a single '/' character as a delimiter, while the problem description states that any number of consecutive '/' characters should be treated as a single delimiter. 

For example, if the input path is "/usr///local//nginx/sbin", the program will output "/usr/local/nginx/sbin" instead of the normalized form "/usr/local/nginx/sbin". This inconsistency makes the program incorrect.
