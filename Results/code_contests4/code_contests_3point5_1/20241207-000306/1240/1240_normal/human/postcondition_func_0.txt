The function `func_1` reads input characters from the standard input until it encounters a newline character. It processes the input path, which is a string containing lowercase Latin letters and '/', with a special handling for the '/' character. If the count of characters in the input path is 0, it prints '/' to the standard output. This function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
