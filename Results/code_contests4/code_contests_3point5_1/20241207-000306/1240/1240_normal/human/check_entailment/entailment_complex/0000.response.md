Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly transforms a given path to its normalized form as described in the problem description. It reads characters from the standard input and handles the '/' character based on the rules specified. It ensures that the output path is in the normalized form by correctly handling the '/' characters.

The program checks for the input characters and prints them to the standard output in the normalized form, ensuring that the smallest possible number of characters '/' are used in the output path.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for transforming a path to its normalized form.
