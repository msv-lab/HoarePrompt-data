Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly transform the given path to the normalized form as described in the problem description. The program reads input character by character using `sys.stdin.read(1)`, which is not the correct approach to read the entire path at once. The program also does not handle cases where multiple consecutive '/' characters occur in the input path.

Additionally, the program does not output the normalized path correctly. It prints '/' after every character in the input path, which is not the expected behavior.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
