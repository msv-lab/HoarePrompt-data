Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads characters from the standard input until it encounters a newline character, as described in the problem.
- It processes the input path and handles the '/' character by printing '/' only when necessary to normalize the path.
- If the count of characters in the input path is 0, it prints '/' to the standard output, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code correctly normalizes the path by removing any unnecessary consecutive '/' characters.
- The output hints also confirm that the code matches the problem description by describing the functionality of the `func_1` function accurately.
