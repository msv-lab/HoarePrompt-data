Postcondition: ***The input path is a string containing lowercase Latin letters and character '/', starting with at least one character '/'. If a is equal to '\n', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If a is not equal to '\n', count is 1, flag is 0. If flag is 1, the program remains in the same state. The letter 'a' is printed to the standard output.***
