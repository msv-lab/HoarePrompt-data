Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an input array 'a', sorts it, then iterates over the array to count the number of occurrences of the third smallest element. This logic correctly identifies the number of triples of indices (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible. The program follows the problem description and gives the correct output for all provided examples.
