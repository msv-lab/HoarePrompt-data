Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly solves the problem by sorting the array and then counting the number of occurrences of the third smallest element in the array. This is because the product of the three smallest elements will always be the minimum possible product. The program then counts the number of occurrences of the third smallest element and prints it as the output. 

For all the given examples in the problem description, the program produces the correct output:
1. For the input [1, 1, 1, 1], the output should be 4, as there are 4 ways to choose three ones.
2. For the input [1, 3, 2, 3, 4], the output should be 2, as there are 2 ways to choose 1 and 3.
3. For the input [1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2], the output should be 1, as there is only 1 way to choose 1 and 3. 

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
