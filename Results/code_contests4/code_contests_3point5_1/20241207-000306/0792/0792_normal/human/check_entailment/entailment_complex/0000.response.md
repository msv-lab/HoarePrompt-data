Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. It simply counts the consecutive occurrences of the third element in the sorted list `a` starting from the fourth position, which is not the same as finding the number of triples (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible. This program does not consider all possible combinations of triples to find the minimum product. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
