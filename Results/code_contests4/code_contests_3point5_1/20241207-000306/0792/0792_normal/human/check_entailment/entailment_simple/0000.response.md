Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program only counts the number of consecutive occurrences of the third minimum element in the sorted array, which is not the same as finding the number of triples (i, j, k) where ai·aj·ak is the minimum possible. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
