You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: After returning from the army Makes received a gift — an array a consisting of n positive integer numbers. He hadn't been solving problems for a long time, so he became interested to answer a particular question: how many triples of indices (i, j, k) (i < j < k), such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible, are there in the array? Help him with it!

Input

The first line of input contains a positive integer number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of elements in array a. The second line contains n positive integer numbers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of a given array.

Output

Print one number — the quantity of triples (i, j, k) such that i, j and k are pairwise distinct and ai·aj·ak is minimum possible.

Examples

Input

6
1 3 3 1 3 2


Output

1

Note

In the first example Makes always chooses three ones out of four, and the number of ways to choose them is 4.

In the second example a triple of numbers (1, 2, 3) is chosen (numbers, not indices). Since there are two ways to choose an element 3, then the answer is 2.

In the third example a triple of numbers (1, 1, 2) is chosen, and there's only one way to choose indices.
Function definition:
