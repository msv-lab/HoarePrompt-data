Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, `ans` may or may not be incremented, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented and be less than the length of list `a` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
