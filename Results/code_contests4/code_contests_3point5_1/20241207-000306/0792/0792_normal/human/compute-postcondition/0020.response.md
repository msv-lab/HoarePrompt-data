Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` simply prints the value stored in the variable `ans`. Since the initial state mentions that `ans` contains the number of consecutive occurrences of `x` starting from the third element in the sorted list `a`, and `x` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, we can conclude that `ans` already holds the desired value based on the initial state information.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, `ans` contains the number of consecutive occurrences of `x` starting from the third element in list `a`.**
