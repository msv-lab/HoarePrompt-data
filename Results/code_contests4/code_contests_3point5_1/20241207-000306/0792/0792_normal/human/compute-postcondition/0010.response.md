Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element in the sorted list `a`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `x`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If the loop does not find `x` at index `i` in the list `a`, the loop breaks and exits without any changes.***
