Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `x` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, `i` should be incremented and be less than the length of list `a`, `ans` may or may not be incremented. If a[i] == x, `ans` will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, either the loop terminates or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
