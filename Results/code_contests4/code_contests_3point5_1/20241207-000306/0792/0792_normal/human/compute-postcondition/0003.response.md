Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the element at index 2 in the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` will be the third element in the sorted list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is the third element in the sorted list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is the third element in the sorted list `a`**
