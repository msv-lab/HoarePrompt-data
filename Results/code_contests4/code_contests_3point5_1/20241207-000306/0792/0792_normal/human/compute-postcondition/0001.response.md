Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the result of mapping integers from the input split by space. Since `n` is an input integer, we do not have a specific value for `n`, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a mapped list of integers from user input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a mapped list of integers from user input**
