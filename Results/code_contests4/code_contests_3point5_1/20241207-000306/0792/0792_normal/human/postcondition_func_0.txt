The function `func` reads an integer `n`, then reads a list of integers and sorts them. It finds the third element in the sorted list and counts the consecutive occurrences of that element starting from the fourth position. The function then prints the count of consecutive occurrences. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
