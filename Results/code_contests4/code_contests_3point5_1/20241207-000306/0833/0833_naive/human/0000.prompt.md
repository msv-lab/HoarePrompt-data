You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two children are playing tag on a number line. (In the game of tag, the child called "it" tries to catch the other child.) The child who is "it" is now at coordinate A, and he can travel the distance of V per second. The other child is now at coordinate B, and she can travel the distance of W per second.

He can catch her when his coordinate is the same as hers. Determine whether he can catch her within T seconds (including exactly T seconds later). We assume that both children move optimally.

Constraints

* -10^9 \leq A,B \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq V,W \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq T \leq 10^9
* A \neq B
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A V
B W
T


Output

If "it" can catch the other child, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

Examples

Input

1 2
3 1
3


Output

YES


Input

1 2
3 2
3


Output

NO


Input

1 2
3 3
3


Output

NO
Program:
```
FAST_IO = 1
if FAST_IO:
    import io, sys, atexit
    rr = iter(sys.stdin.read().splitlines()).next
    sys.stdout = _OUTPUT_BUFFER = io.BytesIO()

    @atexit.register
    def write():
        sys.__stdout__.write(_OUTPUT_BUFFER.getvalue())
else:
    rr = raw_input
rri = lambda : int(rr())
rrm = lambda : map(int, rr().split())

def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T
    lb = B + W * T
    if A < B:
        return la >= lb
    else:
        return lb >= la
(A, V) = rrm()
(B, W) = rrm()
T = rri()
ans = func_1(A, B, V, W, T)
if ans:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
