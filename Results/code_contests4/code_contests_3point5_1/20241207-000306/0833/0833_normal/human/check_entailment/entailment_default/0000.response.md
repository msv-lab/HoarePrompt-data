Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes integers A, B, V, W, and T as input, calculates the positions of both children after T seconds, and compares them to determine if "it" can catch the other child. The code handles all the constraints provided in the problem description and covers all potential cases. The output of the code aligns with the expected results based on the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code logic and do not hint at any edge cases that are not handled by the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
