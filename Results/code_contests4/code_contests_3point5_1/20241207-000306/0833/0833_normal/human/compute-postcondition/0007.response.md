Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts integers A, B, V, W, and T, and calculates the values of 'la' and 'lb' based on the initial values provided. It then compares 'la' and 'lb' and returns True if 'la' is greater than or equal to 'lb' when A is less than B, and returns True if 'lb' is greater than or equal to 'la' when A is greater than or equal to B. The function does not consider edge cases where A is equal to B explicitly, so this scenario is missing from the functionality description.**
