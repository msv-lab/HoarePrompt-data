Example Answer:
`la` is assigned the value of `A + V * T`, where `A`, `V`, and `T` are integers. Given the constraints, the value of `la` can be calculated based on the initial values of `A`, `V`, and `T`. 
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `V`, `W`, and `T` are integers such that -10^9 <= A,B <= 10^9, 1 <= V,W <= 10^9, and 1 <= T <= 10^9. A is not equal to B; `la` is calculated based on the initial values of `A`, `V`, and `T`.**
