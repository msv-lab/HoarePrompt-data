The function `func_1` accepts parameters A, B, V, W, and T, all of which are integers satisfying the given constraints. The function calculates the values of 'la' and 'lb' based on the initial values of A, B, V, W, and T.

Case 1: The function returns whether the calculated value of 'la' based on initial values of A, V, and T is greater than or equal to the calculated value of 'lb' based on initial values of B, W, and T.

Case 2: The function returns whether the value of `lb` is greater than or equal to the value of `la`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integers A, B, V, W, and T, calculate 'la' and 'lb' based on the given initial values, and return whether the value of 'la' is greater than or equal to the value of 'lb' in Case 1, and whether the value of 'lb' is greater than or equal to the value of 'la' in Case 2.
