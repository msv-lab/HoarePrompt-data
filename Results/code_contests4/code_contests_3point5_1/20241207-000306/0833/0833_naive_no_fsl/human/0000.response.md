Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the final coordinates of both children after T seconds and then determines if "it" can catch the other child based on their positions. The logic implemented in the `func_1` function checks if the child who is "it" can catch the other child within T seconds. The program considers all possible cases where "it" can catch the other child optimally. It handles the constraints provided in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
