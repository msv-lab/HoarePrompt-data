Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer, arr contains the input values as integers; last is the last element in the list arr, for the loop to execute the first time i is n-1 and n is greater than 0. The element at index i in arr is greater than the last element in the list arr; d is the result of subtracting the last element in the list arr from the element at index i in arr. Additionally, after entering the if statement (d > 1) where d is greater than 1.***
