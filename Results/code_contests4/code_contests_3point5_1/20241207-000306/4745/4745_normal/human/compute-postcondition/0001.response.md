Example Answer:
The list `arr` is assigned the values obtained by converting input from `stdin.readline().split()` to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values in the list `arr` correspond to the input integers. Since there are no changes to other variables, the output state is: N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer, arr contains the input values as integers.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer, arr contains the input values as integers**
