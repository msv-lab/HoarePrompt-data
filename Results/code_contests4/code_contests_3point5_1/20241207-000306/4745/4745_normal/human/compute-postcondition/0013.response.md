Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated as the difference between the value at index `i` in the `arr` array and the value of `last`. The index `i` is `n-2`, so the value at that index in the array is used. The value of `last` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H_i are positive integers, n is a positive integer, arr contains input values, last is updated, i is n-2, for the loop to execute the next time n is greater than 0, d is the difference between arr[n-2] and last.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i are positive integers, n is a positive integer, arr contains input values, last is updated, i is n-2, for the loop to execute the next time n is greater than 0, d is the difference between arr[n-2] and last**
