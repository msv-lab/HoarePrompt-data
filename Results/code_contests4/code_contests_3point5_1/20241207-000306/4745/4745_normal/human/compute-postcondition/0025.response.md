Example Answer:
The value of `last` is updated to the minimum value between the current `last` and `arr[i]`. Since `last` and `arr[i]` are positive integers, `last` will be updated to the smaller of the two values. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, H_i, n, arr, last, i, d are positive integers. For the loop to execute the next time, n must be greater than 0. If arr[i] > last and d > 1, the program exits with code 0.
Output State: **N, H_i, n, arr, last, i, d are positive integers. For the loop to execute the next time, n must be greater than 0. If arr[i] > last and d > 1, the program exits with code 0.**
