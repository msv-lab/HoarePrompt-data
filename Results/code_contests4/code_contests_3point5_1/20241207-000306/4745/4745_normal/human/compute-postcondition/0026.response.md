Output State: **N, H_i, n, arr, last, i, d are positive integers. 'No' is printed and the program exits with code 0 if arr[i] is greater than last and the difference between arr[i] and last is greater than 1 at any point during the loop execution. Otherwise, the loop executes successfully without printing 'No' and exits normally.**
