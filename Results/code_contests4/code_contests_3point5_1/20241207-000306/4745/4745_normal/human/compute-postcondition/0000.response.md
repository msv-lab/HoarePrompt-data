Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input read from standard input. Since the initial state specifies that `N` is a positive integer, after execution `n` will hold a positive integer value. The values of `H_i` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer**
