Example Answer:
The value of `last` is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `last` and the element at index `i` in `arr`. If the element at index `i` in `arr` is greater than `last`, then `last` is updated to that element. If not, `last` remains unchanged. The rest of the program state remains the same.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer, arr contains the input values as integers; last is updated to the minimum value between the current value of last and the element at index i in arr, for the loop to execute the first time i is n-1 and n is greater than 0. If the element at index i in arr is greater than the last element in the list arr, d is the result of subtracting the last element in the list arr from the element at index i in arr. If d > 1, the program state remains the same as before the if statement.**
