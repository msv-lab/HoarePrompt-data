Example Answer: 
The variable `last` is assigned the value of the last element in the list `arr`, which is accessed using the index `n - 1`. The value of `n` is a positive integer representing the index in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer, arr contains the input values as integers; last is the last element in the list arr.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer, arr contains the input values as integers; last is the last element in the list arr**
