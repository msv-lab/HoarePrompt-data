According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 0. The loop iterates in reverse starting from n-1 down to 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that n is greater than 0, i is n-1, and last is the last element in the list arr.
State: **N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; n is a positive integer, arr contains the input values as integers; last is the last element in the list arr, for the loop to execute the first time i is n-1 and n is greater than 0**
