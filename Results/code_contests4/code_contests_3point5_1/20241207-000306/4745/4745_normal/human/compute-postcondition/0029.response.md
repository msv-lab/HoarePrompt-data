Functionality: **The function `func` reads in an integer `n` followed by a list of integers `arr`. It then iterates through the list checking if each element is not greater than the previous element and the difference is not greater than 1. If these conditions are met for all elements, it prints 'Yes'. If any element violates the conditions, it prints 'No' and exits the program. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
