According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `arr`, `last`, and the conditions `arr[i] > last` and `arr[n-2] - last > 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions `arr[i] > last` and `arr[n-2] - last > 1` were met, `i` was `n-2`, and `n` was a positive integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `n-3`.
2. The condition `n > 0` must be maintained to ensure the loop can execute.
3. The values of `N`, `H_i`, `n`, `arr`, and `last` need to be maintained as positive integers and updated accordingly.

State: **N, H_i, n, arr, last are positive integers, `i` is `n-3`, for the loop to execute the next time `n` must be greater than 0**.
