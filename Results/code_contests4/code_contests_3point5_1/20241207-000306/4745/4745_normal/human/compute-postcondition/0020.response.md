Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated as the difference between the element at index `i` in the array `arr` and the value of `last`. The value of `i` is `n-3`, so the element at index `i` is accessed. Since all variables are positive integers, the subtraction will result in a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: N, H_i, n, arr, last are positive integers, `i` is `n-3`, for the loop to execute the next time `n` must be greater than 0, `d` is a positive integer.
Output State: **N, H_i, n, arr, last are positive integers, `i` is `n-3`, for the loop to execute the next time `n` must be greater than 0, `d` is a positive integer**
