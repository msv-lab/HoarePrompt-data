Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It goes through the list of heights from right to left, ensuring that each height is less than or equal to the previous one. If at any point a height is greater than the previous height by more than 1, it immediately prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it continues until the end of the list and prints 'Yes' if no violation is found.

The program covers all possible cases as it iterates through the list in reverse order, checking each height against the previous one. It correctly determines if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right.
