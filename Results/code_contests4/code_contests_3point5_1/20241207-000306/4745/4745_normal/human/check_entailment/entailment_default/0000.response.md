Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code iterates through the list of heights and checks if each height is not greater than the previous height and the difference is not greater than 1. If these conditions are met for all elements, it prints 'Yes'. If any element violates the conditions, it prints 'No' and exits the program. This logic aligns with the problem description which requires checking if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
