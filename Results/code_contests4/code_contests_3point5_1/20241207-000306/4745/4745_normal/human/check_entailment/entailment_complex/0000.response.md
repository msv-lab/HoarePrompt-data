Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads in the input values, iterates through the list of heights, and checks if each height is non-decreasing from left to right. If any height violates this condition, it prints 'No' and exits the program. If all heights satisfy the condition, it prints 'Yes'. The program works correctly for all potential cases as it follows the logic of comparing each height with the previous one and checking the difference to ensure non-decreasing heights.
