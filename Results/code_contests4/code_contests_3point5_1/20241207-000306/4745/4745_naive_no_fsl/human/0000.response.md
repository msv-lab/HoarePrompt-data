Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. It iterates through the heights of the squares from right to left, and if it finds a height that is greater than the last height, it checks if the difference is more than 1. If it is, it immediately prints 'No'. Otherwise, it updates the last height to be the minimum of the current height and the last height. If it reaches the end of the iteration without printing 'No', it prints 'Yes'. The program covers all potential cases and accurately follows the problem description.
