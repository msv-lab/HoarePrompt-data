Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program iterates through the list of heights in reverse order. It keeps track of the last height seen so far. If the current height is greater than the last height seen, it checks if the difference between the current height and the last height is more than 1, in which case it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it updates the last height seen to be the minimum of the current height and the last height. If the program reaches the end without printing 'No', it prints 'Yes' indicating that it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and prints the correct output for each input provided.
