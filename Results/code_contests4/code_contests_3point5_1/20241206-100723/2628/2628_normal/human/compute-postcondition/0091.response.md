Example Answer:
The `exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program. Since the `exit()` function is called, no further code execution takes place. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State: `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`.
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`**
