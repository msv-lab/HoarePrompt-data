Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is updated to `y1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`; the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is updated to `y1`.
Output State: **`x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`; the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is updated to `y1`**
