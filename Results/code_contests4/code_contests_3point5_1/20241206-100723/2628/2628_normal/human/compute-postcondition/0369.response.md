Postcondition: **After not entering the if condition, the values of variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]` remain the same as in the initial state. Additionally, the sum of A[i][0] for i in range(n) is not equal to 1 and the sum of B[i][0] for i in range(m) is not equal to 1.**
