Example Answer:
The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. The previous values of `x2` and `y2` are unknown, so the output state is: `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`.
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`**
