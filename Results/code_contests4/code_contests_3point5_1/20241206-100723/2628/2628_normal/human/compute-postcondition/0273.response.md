Example Answer:
The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the tuple `a[j]`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `a[j]` are assigned integer values, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values.
Output State: **`x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `a[j]` are assigned integer values, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values**
