Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized as described, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1` maintain their initial values, `x2` and `y2` are either 0 or the values stored in the tuple at index `j` in list `b`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2` and `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `n`, `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized as described, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1` maintain their initial values, `x2` and `y2` are either 0 or the values stored in the tuple at index `j` in list `b`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
