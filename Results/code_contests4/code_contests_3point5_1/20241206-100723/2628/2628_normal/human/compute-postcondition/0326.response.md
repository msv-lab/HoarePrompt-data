Postcondition: ***`x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then the program prints -1. If none of these conditions are met, then `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. In both cases, the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1` if it was the first condition met, or the value of `y1` if it was the second condition met.***
