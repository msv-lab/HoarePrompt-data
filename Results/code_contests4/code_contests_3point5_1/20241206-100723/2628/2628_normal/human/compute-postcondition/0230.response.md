Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Matrix `A` has been updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `n`, `x2` and `y2` have been assigned values based on the conditions specified, and the elements of matrix `B` have been modified as described. If set(b[i]) is not equal to set(a[j]), the following actions take place: If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, the value at index `[i][0]` of matrix `B` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`.***
