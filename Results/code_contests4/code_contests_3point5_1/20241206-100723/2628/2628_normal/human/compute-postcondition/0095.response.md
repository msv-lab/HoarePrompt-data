Example Answer:
The code snippet prints -1 and does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`.
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`**
