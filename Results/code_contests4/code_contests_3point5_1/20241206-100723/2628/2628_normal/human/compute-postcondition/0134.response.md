Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, where `b[j]` is a tuple. The set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`. `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `y2`. `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`.***
