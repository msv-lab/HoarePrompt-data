Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j` are integers starting from 0. `x1` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `y1` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, `m` is greater than 0. The sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`. After the if condition, if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then `A[i][1]` is updated to the value of `y1`. Otherwise, if the else part executes, `y1` is equal to `a[i]`, `A[i][1]` is updated to the value of `y1` which is `a[i]`, and `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1.***
