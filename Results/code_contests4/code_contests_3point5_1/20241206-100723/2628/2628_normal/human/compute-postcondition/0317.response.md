Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `B` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `B`, `i`, and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`, and the value at index `i` in list `B` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`, and the value at index `i` in list `B` is incremented by 1**
