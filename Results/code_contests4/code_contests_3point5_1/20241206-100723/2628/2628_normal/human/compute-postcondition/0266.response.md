Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The values of `x2` and `y2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, and `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1**
