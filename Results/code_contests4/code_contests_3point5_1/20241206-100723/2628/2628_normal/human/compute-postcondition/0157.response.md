Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]` for the next iteration of the loop where `j` must be less than `m`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
