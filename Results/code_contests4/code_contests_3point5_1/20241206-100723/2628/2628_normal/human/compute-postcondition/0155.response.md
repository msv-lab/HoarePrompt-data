Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
