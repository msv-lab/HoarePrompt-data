Postcondition: ***All variables x1, y1, a, i, n, and m remain unchanged. Matrix A has been updated. If B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to y1, the program exits. Otherwise, for the loop to execute again, j must be less than n. x2 and y2 are assigned the values of the j-th element of matrix A. Element at position [i][0] in matrix B is incremented by 1. B[i][1] is assigned the value of y1.***
