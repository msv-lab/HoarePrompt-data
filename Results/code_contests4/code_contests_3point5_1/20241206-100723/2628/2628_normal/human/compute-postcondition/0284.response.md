Postcondition: ***`x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `a[j]` are integers, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then all variables retain their previous integer values and the program prints -1. If `B[i][1]` is equal to `y1`, then `B[i][1]` is updated to `y1` and all other variables retain their previous values.***
