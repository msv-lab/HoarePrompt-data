Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized as described, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` maintain their initial values, and the tuples at index `i` in list `a` and index `j` in list `b` are not the same in terms of their elements. If `x1 == x2` or `x1 == y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. The state of `B`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and the relationships between them remain as described in the precondition.***
