Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]` are determined based on the conditions inside the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `m`. After the code execution, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]` respectively.**
