Example Answer: 
`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the integers obtained by splitting the input read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. Since the input is constrained by the precondition, the values of `n` and `m` will be valid integers between 1 and 12. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12**
