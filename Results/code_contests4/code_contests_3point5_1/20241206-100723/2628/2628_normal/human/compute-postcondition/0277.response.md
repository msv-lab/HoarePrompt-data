Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous values of `B[i][1]` and `x1` are unknown, so the output state is: `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]` is updated by adding 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned `x1`, `a[j]` are assigned integer values, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values.
Output State: **`x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]` is updated by adding 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned `x1`, `a[j]` are assigned integer values, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values**
