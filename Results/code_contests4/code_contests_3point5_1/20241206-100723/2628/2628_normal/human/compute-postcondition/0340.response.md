Postcondition: ***`x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is updated to `y1` if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`.***
