Example Answer:
`A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`.
Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`**
