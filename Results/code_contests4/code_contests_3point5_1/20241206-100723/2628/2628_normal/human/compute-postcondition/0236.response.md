Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are all incremented by 1. `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0. `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `j` in list `a`. The set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`***
