Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 and `j` is less than `m`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `b[j]`. If `set(a[i])` is not equal to `set(b[j])`, the following conditions apply: if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. If none of the above conditions are met, the element at index `i` of the first column of matrix `A` is incremented by 1 and the value at index `i` of the second column of matrix `A` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
