Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Matrix `A` has been updated according to the conditions specified in the loop code for all elements. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then the program prints -1. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Otherwise, `x1` is assigned to `B[i][1]` and `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. After executing the if else block, the set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `y1` is equal to either `x2` or `y2`.***
