Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `Bi`. The value of `i` is unknown, so the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without additional information about the list `B`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `Bi`.
Output State: **`ans` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `Bi`**
