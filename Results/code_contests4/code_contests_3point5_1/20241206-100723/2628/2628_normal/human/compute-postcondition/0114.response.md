Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `y1`, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
