Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. The set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != x1, the code prints -1. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. The set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. If A[i][1] is 0 or A[i][1] is equal to x1, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1.***
