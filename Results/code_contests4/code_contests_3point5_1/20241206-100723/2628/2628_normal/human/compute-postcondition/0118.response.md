Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]` will depend on the conditions met during the loop iterations. If the conditions for incrementing `A[i][0]` and updating `A[i][1]` are met, then they will reflect those changes. If the loop does not execute at all, the values of `A[i][0]` and `A[i][1]` will remain unchanged.**
