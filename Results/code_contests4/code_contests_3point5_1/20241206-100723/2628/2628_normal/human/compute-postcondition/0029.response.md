Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns, where either `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, or `A[i][1]` is equal to 0. After the if else block, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. `B` remains unchanged with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0]. `i` remains 0, `j` remains 0, `x1` and `y1` still hold the values of the tuple at index `i` in list `a`. `x2` and `y2` still hold the values of the tuple at index `j` in list `b`. `x1` is not equal to `x2`, `x1` is not equal to `y2`, `y1` is not equal to `x2`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`.***
