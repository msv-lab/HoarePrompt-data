Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized with 0, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `i` in list `a`, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `j` in list `b`. Additionally, the tuples at index `i` in list `a` and index `j` in list `b` are not the same in terms of their elements and the condition `(x1 == x2 or x1 == y2)` is true. Moreover, `(A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != x1)` is false, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1.**
