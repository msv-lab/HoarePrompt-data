Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, the variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, for the loop to execute A is a list with at least 1 element and the sum of elements in A at index 0 for all i in the range of n is equal to 1. If `Ai[0]` is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of `Ai[1`.***
