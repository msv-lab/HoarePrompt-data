Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then the corresponding values in matrix `A` are updated accordingly. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the values at index `i` of the first column of matrix `A` remain unchanged. If `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, the value at index `i` of the first column of matrix `A` is updated to `x1`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, no changes occur in the variables as the program exits immediately. If `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m`, `x2`, `y2`, `A[i][0]`, and `A[i][1]` are updated as described above.***
