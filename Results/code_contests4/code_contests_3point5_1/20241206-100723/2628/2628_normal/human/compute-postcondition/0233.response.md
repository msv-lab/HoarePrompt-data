Example Answer:
`x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`. The values of `b` and `i` are unknown in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific values of `x1` and `y1`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
Output State: **All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged**
