According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. If set(b[i]) is not equal to set(a[j]), the program checks conditions based on `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and the values in list `B`. If the conditions are met, the program prints -1. Otherwise, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. In all cases, the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly**.
