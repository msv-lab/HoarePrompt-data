Postcondition: ***`x2`, `y2`, `B[i][1]` are assigned values based on the conditions. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, and the program is terminated. Otherwise, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
