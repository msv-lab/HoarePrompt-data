Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value `y1`, but the previous values of `y1` and `B[i][0]` are unknown. All variables remain incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain incremented by 1, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is `y1`.
Output State: **All variables remain incremented by 1, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is `y1`**
