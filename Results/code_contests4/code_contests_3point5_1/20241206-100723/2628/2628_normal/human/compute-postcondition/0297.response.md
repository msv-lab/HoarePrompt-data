Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]` are determined based on the conditions inside the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. After the code execution, `x1` is assigned the value of `B[i][0]`, `y1` is assigned the value of `B[i][1]`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. Additionally, `set(B[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`. The condition `x1 == x2 or x1 == y2` is true after the if statement is executed. Moreover, the condition `(B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == x1)` is true after entering the else block.***
