Example Answer:
The code snippet `A[i][0] += 1` increments the value in the first column of the `i-th` row in the 2D list `A` by 1. Therefore, the value at `A[i][0]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **Variables `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized as described with the value at `A[i][0]` incremented by 1, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` maintain their initial values.**
