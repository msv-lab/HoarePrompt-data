Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then the code prints -1. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y2`, then `B[i][1]` is updated to `y1`.***
