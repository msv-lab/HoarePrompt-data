Output State: **If the sum of elements in A at index 0 for all i in the range of n is equal to 1, then `ans` will be assigned the value of the last element `A[i][1]` where `A` is a list of n elements. Otherwise, `ans` will remain unchanged. All other variables will remain the same as in the initial state.**
