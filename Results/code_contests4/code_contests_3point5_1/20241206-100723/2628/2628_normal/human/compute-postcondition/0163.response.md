Example Answer:
The value of `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 and `j` is less than `m`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `b[j]`. 
Output State: **All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 and `j` is less than `m`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `b[j]`.**
