According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 0.
State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j` is 0, `x1` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `y1` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
