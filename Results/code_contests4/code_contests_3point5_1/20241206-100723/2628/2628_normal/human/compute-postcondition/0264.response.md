Example Answer:
The code snippet prints -1 but does not affect the values of `x2` and `y2`, which are assigned the value of `a[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`.
Output State: **`x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]**
