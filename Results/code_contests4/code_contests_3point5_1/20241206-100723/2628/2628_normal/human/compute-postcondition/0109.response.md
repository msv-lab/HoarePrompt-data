Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions; `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then no variables are affected due to the `exit()` function. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is an unknown value.***
