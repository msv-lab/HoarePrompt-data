Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, the values of variables `A` and `B` will be updated according to the conditions in the loop. The values of `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` will be as per the loop iterations. If any of the conditions in the loop are met, -1 will be printed and the program will exit. Otherwise, the loop will update the values of `A` based on the comparisons between tuples in lists `a` and `b`.**
