Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j` are 0, `x1` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `y1` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values from `b[j]`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0. The sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. Additionally, after entering the if condition, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`***.
