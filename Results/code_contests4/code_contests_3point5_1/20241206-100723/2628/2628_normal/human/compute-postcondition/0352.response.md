Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, the variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]` are updated. For the loop to execute another time, `A` is a list with at least 2 elements and the sum of elements in `A` at index 0 for all `i` in the range of `n` is equal to 1. If `A[i][0]` is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of `A[i][1`]***
