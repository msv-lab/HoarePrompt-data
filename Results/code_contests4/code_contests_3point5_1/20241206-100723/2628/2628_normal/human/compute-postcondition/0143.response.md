Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. If the set of elements in `a[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `b[j]`, the following conditions apply: If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the function prints -1. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `x1`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, the function prints -1. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
