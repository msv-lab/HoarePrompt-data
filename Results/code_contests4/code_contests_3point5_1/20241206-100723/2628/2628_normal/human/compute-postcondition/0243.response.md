Output State: **All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0. `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `j` in list `a`. The set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`. Either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`. Additionally, either `B[i][1]` is 0 or `B[i][1]` is equal to `x1`. `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.**
