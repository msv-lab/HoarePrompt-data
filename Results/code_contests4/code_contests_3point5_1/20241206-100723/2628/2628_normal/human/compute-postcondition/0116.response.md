Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions; `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then no variables are affected due to the `exit()` function. Otherwise, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then the program prints -1. In either case, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` takes on an unknown value.***
