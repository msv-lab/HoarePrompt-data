Example Answer:
The value of `B[i][1]` is updated to the value of `x1`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`, and the value at index `i` in list `B` is incremented by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`.
Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`, and the value at index `i` in list `B` is incremented by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`**
