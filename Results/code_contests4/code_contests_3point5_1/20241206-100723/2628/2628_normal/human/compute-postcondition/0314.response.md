Example Answer:
`x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`, where `j` is the index used to access the element in `a`. The values of `x2` and `y2` will be updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`.
Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`**
