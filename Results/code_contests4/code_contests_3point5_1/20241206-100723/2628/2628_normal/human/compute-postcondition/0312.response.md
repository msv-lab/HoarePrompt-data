Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]` are determined based on the loop conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. After the code execution, `x1` is assigned the value of `B[i][0] + 1` if `x1 == x2` or `x1 == y2`, otherwise `x1` is assigned the value of `B[i][0]`. `y1` is assigned the value of `B[i][1]` if `B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == x1`, otherwise `B[i][1]` is updated to the value of `y1`. `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. Additionally, `set(B[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`. After the if condition, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `B[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, then no changes occur in the variables and the program exits immediately. Otherwise, `B[i][1]` is updated to the value of `y1`.***
