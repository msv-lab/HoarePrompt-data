Example Answer:
`A[i][1]` is assigned the value `y1`, but the previous values of `A`, `i`, and `y1` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value `y1`.
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value `y1`**
