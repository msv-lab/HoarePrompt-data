Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`, no changes occur in the variables as the program exits immediately. Otherwise, `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from `b[j]`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
