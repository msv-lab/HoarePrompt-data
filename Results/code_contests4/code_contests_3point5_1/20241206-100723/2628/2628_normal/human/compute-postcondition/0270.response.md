Postcondition: ***`x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `a[j]` are all assigned integer values. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `x2` and `y2` are assigned the value of `a[j]`, and the program terminates. Otherwise, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the value of `a[j]`, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits abruptly. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, and `x2`, `y2` retain their original values of `a[j]`.***
