Example Answer:
The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program. The values of `x2` and `y2` are not affected by this function. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j] and the program is terminated.
Output State: **`x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j] and the program is terminated**
