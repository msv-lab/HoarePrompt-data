Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Matrix `A` has been updated. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `x2` and `y2` are not assigned any values, and the program exits. Otherwise, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of the j-th element of matrix `A`. Additionally, the element at index `[i][0]` of matrix `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of the j-th element of matrix `A`. Element at position `[i][0]` in matrix `B` is incremented by 1. `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
