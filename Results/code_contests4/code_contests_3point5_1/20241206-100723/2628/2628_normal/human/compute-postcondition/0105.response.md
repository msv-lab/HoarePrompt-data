Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(-1)` simply prints -1 to the console. No variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions; `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`.
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions; `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]**
