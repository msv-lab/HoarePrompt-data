Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2` is assigned the value of `b[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then the function prints -1. Otherwise, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
