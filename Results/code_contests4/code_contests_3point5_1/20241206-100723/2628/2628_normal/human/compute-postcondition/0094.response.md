Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+1`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then the values at index `i` of the first column of matrix `A` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the value at index `i` of the first column of matrix `A` is updated to `x1`.***
