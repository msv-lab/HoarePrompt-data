Example Answer:
`A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The value of `x1` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `A[i][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions; `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is an unknown value.
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions; `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`; `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is an unknown value**
