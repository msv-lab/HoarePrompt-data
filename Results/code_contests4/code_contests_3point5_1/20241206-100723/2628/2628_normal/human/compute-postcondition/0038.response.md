Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized as described, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` maintain their initial values. If A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != x1, the program prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value `x1`.***
