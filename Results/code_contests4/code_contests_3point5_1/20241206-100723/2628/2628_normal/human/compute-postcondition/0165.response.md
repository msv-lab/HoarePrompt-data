Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 and `j` is less than `m`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the tuple `b[j]`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.***
