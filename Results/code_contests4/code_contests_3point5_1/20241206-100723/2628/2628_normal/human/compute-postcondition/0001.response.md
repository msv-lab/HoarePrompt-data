Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the input integers after splitting the input string by spaces. Since the initial state does not mention any input values, we cannot determine the specific values in the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input**
