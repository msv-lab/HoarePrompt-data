Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The values of `x2` and `y2` are not affected, as the assignment is only for `a[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`.
Output State: **`x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]**
