Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the values of variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, and `ans` will be determined based on the conditions inside the loop. If either the sum of elements in column A is 1 or the sum of elements in column B is 1, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, all variables will retain their initial values, and the program will print 0.***
