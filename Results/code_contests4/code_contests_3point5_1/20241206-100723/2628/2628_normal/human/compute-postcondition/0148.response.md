Example Answer:
The value of `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`. 
Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `a[0]`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`**
