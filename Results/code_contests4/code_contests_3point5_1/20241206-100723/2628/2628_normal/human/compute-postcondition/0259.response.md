Example Answer:
The variables `x2` and `y2` are assigned the value of `a[j]`, but the code snippet `print(-1)` does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`.
Output State: **`x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`**
