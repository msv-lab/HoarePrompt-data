Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Matrix `A` has been updated according to the conditions specified in the loop code for all elements. `B` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`. Furthermore, after entering the if condition, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`.***
