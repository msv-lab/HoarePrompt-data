Example Answer:
`A[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, so after execution, the Output State is: `A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`A`, `B`, `i`, `j+2`, `m`, `x2`, `y2` are updated values based on loop conditions, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`, `A[i][0]` is increased by 1**
