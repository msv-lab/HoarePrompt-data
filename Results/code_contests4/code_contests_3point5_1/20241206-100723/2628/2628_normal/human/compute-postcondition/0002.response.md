Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping each element of the input list `a` to an integer. The input is taken from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**
