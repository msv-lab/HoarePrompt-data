According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]` are determined based on the loop conditions. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `x1` should be updated based on the condition: if `x1 == x2` or `x1 == y2`, then `x1` should be updated to `B[i][0] + 1`, otherwise `x1` remains the same as `B[i][0]`.
- `y1` should be updated based on the condition: if `B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == x1`, then `y1` should be updated to `B[i][1]`, otherwise `y1` remains the same.
- `x2` and `y2` should be assigned the values of `a[j]`.
- Ensure that `set(B[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j]`).
- Update `B[i][1]` to `y1` if it's not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, otherwise no changes occur.

State: **`x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i + 1`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]` need to be adjusted based on the loop conditions for the next iteration.**
