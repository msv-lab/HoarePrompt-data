Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized as described, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1` maintain their initial values, `x2` and `y2` are either 0 or the values stored in the tuple at index `j` in list `b`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `A` is increased by 1. The second element of the tuple at index `i` in list `A` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program proceeds with the mentioned updates. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x1` is not equal to `y2`, then if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2` and `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
