Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, but the initial state of `x1` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.
Output State: **`x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`**
