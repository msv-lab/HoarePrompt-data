Postcondition: ***All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Matrix `A` has been updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `n`, `x2` and `y2` have been assigned values based on the conditions specified. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits. Otherwise, the value at index `[i][0]` of matrix `B` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`.***
