Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`, the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`, the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1**
