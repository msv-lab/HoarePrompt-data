Output State: **All variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Matrix `A` has been updated. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of the j-th element of matrix `A`. Element at position `[i][0]` in matrix `B` is incremented by 1.**
