Postcondition: ***`ans` may be assigned a new value based on the sum of elements in `A` at index 0 for all `i` in the range of `n`. For the loop to execute a second time, `B` has to have at least 2 elements and `Bi[0]` must be 1. If `Bi[0]` is equal to 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of the second element of `Bi`.***
