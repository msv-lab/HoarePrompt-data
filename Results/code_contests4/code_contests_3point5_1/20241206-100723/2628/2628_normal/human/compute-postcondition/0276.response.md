Example Answer:
The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]` is updated by adding 1, `B[i][1]`, `a[j]` are assigned integer values, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values.
Output State: **`x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]` is updated by adding 1, `B[i][1]`, `a[j]` are assigned integer values, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values**
