Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of `n` tuples, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized as described, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0], `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` maintain their initial values. If set(a[i]) is not equal to set(b[j]) and x1 == x2 or x1 == y2 and A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != x1, then -1 is printed and the program exits. If set(a[i]) is not equal to set(b[j]) and y1 is equal to x2 or y1 is equal to y2 and A[i][1] is not equal to 0 and A[i][1] is not equal to y1, then -1 is printed. If set(a[i]) is not equal to set(b[j]) and none of the mentioned conditions are satisfied, the output state remains the same as the initial state described.***
