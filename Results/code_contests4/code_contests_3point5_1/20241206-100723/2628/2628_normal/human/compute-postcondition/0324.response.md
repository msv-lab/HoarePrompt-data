Postcondition: ***`x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. Additionally, the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
