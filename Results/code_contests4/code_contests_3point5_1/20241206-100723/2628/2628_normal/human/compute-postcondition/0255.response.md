Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, all variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0. `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `j` in list `a`. The set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is set to `y1`. If none of these conditions are met, all variables remain incremented by 1 and -1 is printed.***
