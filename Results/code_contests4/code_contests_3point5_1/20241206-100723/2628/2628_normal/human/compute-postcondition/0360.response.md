Postcondition: ***`ans` may be assigned a new value based on the sum of elements in `A` at index 0 for all `i` in the range of `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `B` has at least 1 element. If `Bi[0] == 1`, then `ans` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `Bi`. Otherwise, no change occurs to `ans`.***
