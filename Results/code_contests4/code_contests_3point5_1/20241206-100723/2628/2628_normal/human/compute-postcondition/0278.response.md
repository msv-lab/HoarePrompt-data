Postcondition: ***`x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `a[j]` are integers. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then no variables are affected. Otherwise, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `B[i][0]` are incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned `x1`, `a[j]` are assigned integer values, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]` values.***
