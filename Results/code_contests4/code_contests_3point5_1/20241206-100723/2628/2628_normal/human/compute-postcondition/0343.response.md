Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the variables `x1` and `y1` will have the final values based on the conditions inside the loop. The values of `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, and `B[i][1]` will depend on the last iteration of the loop. If the loop does not execute, the values of the variables will remain the same as in the initial state.**
