Functionality: The function `func` reads input from the standard input and processes pairs of sets of two distinct integers between 1 and 9. Each pair has exactly one number that is common between them. The function then updates matrices A and B based on specific conditions. It checks if the sum of elements in column A or column B is 1, and assigns the common number to the variable `ans`. If the sum condition is met, it prints `ans`; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not return any value, and it handles input processing and output based on the given constraints.
