Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1. This means that `B[i][0]` will be increased by 1. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`; the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`; the value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly**
