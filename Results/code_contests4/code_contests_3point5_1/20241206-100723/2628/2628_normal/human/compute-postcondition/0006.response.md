Example Answer:
`B` is initialized as a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns where each element is [0, 0]. The values of `m` and `B` are the only affected variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and transformed into a list of tuples with each tuple containing two integers from `a`, `b` is a list of tuples created from pairs of integers in `a`, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized with 0, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0].
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and transformed into a list of tuples with each tuple containing two integers from `a`, `b` is a list of tuples created from pairs of integers in `a`, `A` is a 2D list of `n` rows and 2 columns initialized with 0, `B` is a 2D list with `m` rows and 2 columns initialized with [0, 0]**
