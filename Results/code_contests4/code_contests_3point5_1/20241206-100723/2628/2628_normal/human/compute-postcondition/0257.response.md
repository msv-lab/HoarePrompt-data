According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since all variables `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `x2`, `y2` are incremented by 1 after each iteration, the new values for these variables are: `x1+1`, `y1+1`, `a+1`, `i+1`, `n+1`, `j+1`, `x2+1`, `y2+1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j` less than `n` must still hold true. So, the new value for `j` should be `1` and the new values for `x1`, `y1`, `a`, `i`, `x2`, `y2` should be `x1+1`, `y1+1`, `a+1`, `i+1`, `x2+1`, `y2+1`. 

State: **After the if else block executes, `x1+1`, `y1+1`, `a+1`, `i+1`, `n+1`, `j+1`, `x2+1`, `y2+1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 1**
