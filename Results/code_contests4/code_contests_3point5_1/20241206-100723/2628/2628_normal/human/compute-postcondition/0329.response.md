Example Answer:
The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values at index `j` in list `a`. The previous values of `x2` and `y2` are unknown. The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and the second element at index `i` in list `B` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`x2`, `y2` are updated based on the value at index `j` in list `a`. The value at index `i` of the first element of list `B` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is updated accordingly**
