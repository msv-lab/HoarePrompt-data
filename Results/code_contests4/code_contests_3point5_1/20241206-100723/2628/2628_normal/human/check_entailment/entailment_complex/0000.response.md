Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads input pairs of numbers from two participants, updates matrices A and B based on certain conditions, and then determines the common number with certainty or prints 0 or -1 accordingly. The logic in the program ensures that the common number is deduced correctly based on the given pairs communicated by the participants. It covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem description and handles the cases where the common number can be deduced with certainty, both participants know the number but the observer does not, or the observer cannot determine the common number. The program satisfies all the requirements stated in the problem description.
