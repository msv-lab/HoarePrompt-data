Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the pairs communicated by each participant, checking for the shared number. It updates matrices A and B based on the conditions specified in the loops and then determines the shared number with certainty or outputs 0 if both participants know the shared number. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem description and provides the correct output in each scenario.
