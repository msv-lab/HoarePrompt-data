Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. It reads input from the standard input, processes pairs of sets of two distinct integers between 1 and 9, updates matrices A and B based on specific conditions, and then determines the shared number with certainty. The code correctly handles cases where the sum of elements in column A or column B is 1 and assigns the common number to the variable `ans`. It prints the shared number if it can be deduced with certainty, prints 0 if both participants know the shared number but the observer does not, and prints -1 if there is insufficient information to determine the shared number. Since the code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
