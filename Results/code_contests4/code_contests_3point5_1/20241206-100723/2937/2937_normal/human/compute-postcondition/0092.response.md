Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but since it is being incremented by 1, the new value of `res` is one more than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to `n+1`, `inp` is assigned the input value, `res` is one more than its previous value.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to `n+1`, `inp` is assigned the input value, `res` is one more than its previous value**
