Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so after execution, `res` is increased by 1. The condition mentioned in the initial state is satisfied, so `inp` is now equal to 'BRANDY'. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. The first character of inp is not a digit and inp is not equal to 'ABSINTH'. The inp is not equal to 'BEER'. After entering the if condition, inp is equal to 'BRANDY'; res is incremented by 1.
