Functionality: **The function reads the number of clients `n` as input and then iterates `n` times to process information about each client. If the client's input starts with a digit between '0' and '9' and the input is less than 18, or the input matches specific drink names, the counter `res` is incremented. Finally, the function prints the total count `res` and exits. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.**
