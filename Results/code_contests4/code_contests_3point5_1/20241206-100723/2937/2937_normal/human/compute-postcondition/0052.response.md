Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. If the first character of inp is a digit between '0' and '9' and the integer value of inp is less than 18, res is incremented by 1. If the first character of inp is not a digit and inp is equal to 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WHISKEY', or 'WINE', res is incremented by 1.
