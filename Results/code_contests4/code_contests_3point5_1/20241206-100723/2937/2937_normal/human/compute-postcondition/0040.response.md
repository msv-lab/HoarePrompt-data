Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so after execution, `res` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. The first character of inp is not a digit and inp is not equal to 'ABSINTH'. The inp is not equal to 'BEER'. The inp is not equal to 'BRANDY'. The inp is not equal to 'CHAMPAGNE'. inp is not equal to 'GIN'. inp is not equal to 'RUM'. The inp is not equal to 'SAKE'. inp is not equal to 'TEQUILA'. inp is not equal to 'VODKA'. inp is not equal to 'WISKEY'. After the if condition, inp is equal to 'WINE', `res` is increased by 1.
