According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `rep`. If `rep` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `rep` ranges from 0 to n-1. For the loop to execute one more time, `rep` needs to be less than n, so rep must be less than n. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is rep which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to n, inp is assigned the input value, res may or may not be incremented based on the conditions mentioned.**
