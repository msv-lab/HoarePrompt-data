Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to `n+1`, `inp` is assigned the input value. If `inp[0]` is a digit and `int(inp)` < 18, `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'RUM', `res` is 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `res` is one more than its previous value. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
