Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to `n+1`, `inp` is assigned the input value. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'RUM', `res` is 1. If `inp` is 'SAKE', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'VODKA', `res` is one more than its previous value. If `inp` is 'WISKEY', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'WINE', `res` is also incremented by 1. If `inp` is none of the mentioned values, `res` remains unchanged.***
