Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the new value of `res` will be the previous value + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to n, `inp` is assigned the input value, `res` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to n, `inp` is assigned the input value, `res` is incremented by 1**
