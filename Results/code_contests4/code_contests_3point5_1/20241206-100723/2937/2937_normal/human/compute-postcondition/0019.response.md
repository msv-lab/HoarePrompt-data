Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `res`, the output state will be: `n` is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. The first character of inp is not a digit and inp is not equal to 'ABSINTH'. The inp is not equal to 'BEER'. The inp is not equal to 'BRANDY'. inp is equal to 'CHAMPAGNE', `res` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. The first character of inp is not a digit and inp is not equal to 'ABSINTH'.
