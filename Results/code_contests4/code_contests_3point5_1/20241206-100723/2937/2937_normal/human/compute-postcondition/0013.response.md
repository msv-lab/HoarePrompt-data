Example Answer:
After entering the if condition, `res` is incremented by 1. The value of `res` depends on the previous value of `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. The first character of inp is not a digit and inp is not equal to 'ABSINTH'. After entering the if condition, inp is equal to 'BEER'. `res` is incremented by 1.
