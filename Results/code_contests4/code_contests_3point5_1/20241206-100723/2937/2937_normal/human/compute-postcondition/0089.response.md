Example Answer: 
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `res` is not provided, we can assume it starts at 0. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `rep`, and `inp` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to `n+1`, `inp` is assigned the input value, `res` is 1**
