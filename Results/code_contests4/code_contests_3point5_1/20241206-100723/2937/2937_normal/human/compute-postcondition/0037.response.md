Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is unknown, but after execution, `res` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. The first character of inp is not a digit and inp is not equal to 'ABSINTH'. The inp is not equal to 'BEER'. The inp is not equal to 'BRANDY'. The inp is not equal to 'CHAMPAGNE'. inp is not equal to 'GIN'. inp is not equal to 'RUM'. The inp is not equal to 'SAKE'. inp is not equal to 'TEQUILA'. inp is not equal to 'VODKA'. inp is equal to 'WISKEY'; `res` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, rep ranges from 0 to n-1, inp is assigned the input value. The first character of inp is not a digit and inp is not equal to 'ABSINTH'.
