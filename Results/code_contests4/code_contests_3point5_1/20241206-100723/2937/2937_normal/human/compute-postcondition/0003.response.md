Example Answer:
`inp` is assigned the value `raw_input()`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `rep` ranges from 0 to n-1, the loop will execute n times. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to n-1, `inp` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, `rep` ranges from 0 to n-1, `inp` is assigned the input value**
