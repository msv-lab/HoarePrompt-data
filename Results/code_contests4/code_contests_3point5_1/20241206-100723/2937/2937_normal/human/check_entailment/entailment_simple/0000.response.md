Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the condition for checking the drink names. There is a typo in the program where 'WISKEY' is checked instead of 'WHISKEY'. This means that the program will not correctly check for 'WHISKEY' and will miss counting it. This violates the problem description requirements.

Additionally, there is a typo in the exit status. It should be `sys.exit(0)` instead of `exit(0)`.
