According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `left` remain the same, `b` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, and `left` remain the same, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0**
