Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `k`, where each tuple contains values for 'b', 'left', 'bikes', and 'persons'. The function iterates over the tuples in `k` and updates the values of 'left' and 'b' based on certain conditions. 'left' is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'bikes[i]' and 'person[pi]'. 'b' is updated by adding the minimum value between 'person[pi]' and 'bikes[i]'. Finally, 'b' is decreased by the value of 'left' after all iterations have finished. However, there seems to be a potential issue with the calculation of 'pi' as it is set to -k + i which could lead to unexpected results. It would be best to review this calculation to ensure correct functionality.**
