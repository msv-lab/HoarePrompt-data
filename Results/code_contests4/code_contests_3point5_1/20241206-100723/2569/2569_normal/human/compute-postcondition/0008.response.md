Example Answer:
`left` is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between `bikes[i]` and `person[pi]`. The value of `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `pi` is 1, but the initial values of `bikes` and `person` are not given, so the specific values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `a`, `left` remain the same, `b` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, `left` remain the same, `b` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is 1**
