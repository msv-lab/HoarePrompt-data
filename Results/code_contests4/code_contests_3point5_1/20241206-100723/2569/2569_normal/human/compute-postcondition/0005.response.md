Example Answer:
The value of `pi` is assigned as -k + i. Since `k` is greater than 0, `pi` will be a negative value. `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]` are compared, and the minimum value is added to `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `left` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `a`, `left` remain the same, `b` is updated, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is -k + i.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, `left` remain the same, `b` is updated, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is -k + i**
