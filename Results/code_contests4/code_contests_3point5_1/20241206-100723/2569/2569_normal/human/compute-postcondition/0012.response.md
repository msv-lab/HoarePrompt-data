Example Answer:
The value of `left` is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between `bikes[i]` and `person[pi]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `i` (increased by 1), `k`, and `b` remain the same. The value of `pi` is updated with `-k + i`. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, `left`, `i` (increased by 1), `k`, `pi` (updated with -k + i), `b` remain the same, `left` is updated with the subtraction of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `bikes[i]` and `person[pi]`**
