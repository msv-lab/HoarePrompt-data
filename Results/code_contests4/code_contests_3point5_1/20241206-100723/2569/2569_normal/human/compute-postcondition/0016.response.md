Output State: **The program returns the updated value of 'b' and 'left' after all iterations of the loop have finished. The 'left' variable is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'bikes[i]' and 'person[pi]'. 'b' is updated by adding the minimum value between 'person[pi]' and 'bikes[i]'. Finally, 'b' is decreased by the value of 'left'.**
