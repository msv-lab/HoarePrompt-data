According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so i becomes 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, `left` remain the same, `b` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is -k + i**
