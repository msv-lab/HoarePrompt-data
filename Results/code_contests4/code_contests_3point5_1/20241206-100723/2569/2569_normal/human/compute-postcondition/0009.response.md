Example Answer:
`b` is updated by adding the minimum value between `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `left`, `i`, `k`, and `pi` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `a`, `left`, `i`, `k`, `pi` remain the same, `b` is updated.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, `left`, `i`, `k`, `pi` remain the same, `b` is updated**
