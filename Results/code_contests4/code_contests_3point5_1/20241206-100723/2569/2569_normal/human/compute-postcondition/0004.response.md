Example Answer:
`pi` is assigned the value of -k + i. Then, `left` is updated by subtracting the maximum value between 0 and the result of bikes[i] - person[pi]. The values of bikes, person, and the index i are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of left. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `left` remain the same, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is assigned the value of -k + i.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, and `left` remain the same, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is assigned the value of -k + i**
