Example Answer:
`pi` is assigned the value of -k + i. Since the initial values of `k` and `i` are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact value of `pi`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `left` remain the same, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is assigned the value of -k + i.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `a`, and `left` remain the same, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is assigned the value of -k + i**
