The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `k`, where k is a list of tuples containing values for 'b', 'left', 'bikes', and 'persons'. The values in these tuples are updated based on the given conditions in the loop iterations. After all iterations have finished, the program returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left'. 

The 'left' variable is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'bikes[i]' and 'person[pi]'. 

The 'b' variable is updated by adding the minimum value between 'person[pi]' and 'bikes[i]'. 

Finally, 'b' is decreased by the value of 'left'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of tuples 'k' and update the values of 'b' and 'left' based on the conditions specified in the loop iterations.
