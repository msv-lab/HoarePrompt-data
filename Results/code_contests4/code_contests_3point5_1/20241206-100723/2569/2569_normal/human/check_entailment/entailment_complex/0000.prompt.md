You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A group of n schoolboys decided to ride bikes. As nobody of them has a bike, the boys need to rent them.

The renting site offered them m bikes. The renting price is different for different bikes, renting the j-th bike costs pj rubles.

In total, the boys' shared budget is a rubles. Besides, each of them has his own personal money, the i-th boy has bi personal rubles. The shared budget can be spent on any schoolchildren arbitrarily, but each boy's personal money can be spent on renting only this boy's bike.

Each boy can rent at most one bike, one cannot give his bike to somebody else.

What maximum number of schoolboys will be able to ride bikes? What minimum sum of personal money will they have to spend in total to let as many schoolchildren ride bikes as possible?

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and a (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105; 0 ≤ a ≤ 109). The second line contains the sequence of integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 104), where bi is the amount of the i-th boy's personal money. The third line contains the sequence of integers p1, p2, ..., pm (1 ≤ pj ≤ 109), where pj is the price for renting the j-th bike.

Output

Print two integers r and s, where r is the maximum number of schoolboys that can rent a bike and s is the minimum total personal money needed to rent r bikes. If the schoolchildren cannot rent any bikes, then r = s = 0.

Examples

Input

2 2 10
5 5
7 6


Output

2 3


Input

4 5 2
8 1 1 2
6 3 7 5 2


Output

3 8

Note

In the first sample both schoolchildren can rent a bike. For instance, they can split the shared budget in half (5 rubles each). In this case one of them will have to pay 1 ruble from the personal money and the other one will have to pay 2 rubles from the personal money. In total, they spend 3 rubles of their personal money. This way of distribution of money minimizes the amount of spent personal money.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105 and 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. Each bi and pj are integers such that 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9.**
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `m`, `a`, `left`, `b`, `i`, `k`, `pi` are the same, `left` is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between `bikes[i]` and `person[pi]`, `b` is updated by adding the minimum value between `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]` after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns the updated value of 'b' and 'left' after all iterations of the loop have finished. The 'left' variable is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'bikes[i]' and 'person[pi]'. 'b' is updated by adding the minimum value between 'person[pi]' and 'bikes[i]'. Finally, 'b' is decreased by the value of 'left'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `k`, where each tuple contains values for 'b', 'left', 'bikes', and 'persons'. The function iterates over the tuples in `k` and updates the values of 'left' and 'b' based on certain conditions. 'left' is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the difference between 'bikes[i]' and 'person[pi]'. 'b' is updated by adding the minimum value between 'person[pi]' and 'bikes[i]'. Finally, 'b' is decreased by the value of 'left' after all iterations have finished. However, there seems to be a potential issue with the calculation of 'pi' as it is set to -k + i which could lead to unexpected results. It would be best to review this calculation to ensure correct functionality.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
