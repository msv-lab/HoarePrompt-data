Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The calculation of 'pi' in the `func_1` function seems incorrect as it is set to -k + i which may lead to unexpected results. This can result in incorrect calculation of the remaining personal money 'left' and the total minimum personal money needed to rent the bikes. Thus, the code needs to be revised to ensure correct functionality.
