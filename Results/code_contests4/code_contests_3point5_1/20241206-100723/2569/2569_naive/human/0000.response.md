Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description by sorting the personal money and bike prices, then using binary search to find the maximum number of schoolboys that can rent a bike and the minimum total personal money needed. The function `func_1` calculates the personal money needed based on the number of schoolboys renting a bike. The binary search loop efficiently finds the optimal solution. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
