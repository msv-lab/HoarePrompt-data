The value of `b` is assigned as `n` divided by `i`. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2, `b` will be the result of `n` divided by 2. After that, `count` is incremented by the value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `count` is the previous value of `count` plus `n` divided by 2, `b` is `n` divided by 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `count` is the previous value of `count` plus `n` divided by 2, `b` is `n` divided by 2**
