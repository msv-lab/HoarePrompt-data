According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 1. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `count` is equal to `n`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a value other than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` needs to be adjusted to a value other than 1**
