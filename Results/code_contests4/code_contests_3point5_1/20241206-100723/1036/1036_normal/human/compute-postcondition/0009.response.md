Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `count` is equal to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` in the range should be such that the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` is not 0. If the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` is 0, then the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
