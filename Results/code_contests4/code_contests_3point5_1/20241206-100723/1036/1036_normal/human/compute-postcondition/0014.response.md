Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `i`. The value of `n` is initially greater than 2, and the value of `i` is equal to 2. If `n` is a prime number, the loop will continue executing without breaking. If `n` is not a prime number, the loop will break when `i` is a divisor of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `count` is equal to 2, and `b` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `count` is equal to 2, `b` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `i`**
