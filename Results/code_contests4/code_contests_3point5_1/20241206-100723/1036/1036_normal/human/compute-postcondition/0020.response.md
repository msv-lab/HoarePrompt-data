According to the code, the loop will execute one more time when `n` is not equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, if `b` is equal to 1, then the loop has already exited. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` should not be equal to 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n`, `count`, `b` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `b` is not equal to 1**
