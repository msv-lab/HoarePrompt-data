According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 2. Before the loop starts, `count` is equal to `n`, which means `count` is also greater than 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` should be adjusted to a value greater than 2 and `count` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `count` is equal to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 2**
