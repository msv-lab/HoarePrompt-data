Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `b`, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a prime number greater than 2, `count` is not specified, `b` is not equal to 1, and `count` is incremented by `b`.
Output State: **`n` is a prime number greater than 2, `count` is not specified, `b` is not equal to 1, `count` is incremented by `b`**
