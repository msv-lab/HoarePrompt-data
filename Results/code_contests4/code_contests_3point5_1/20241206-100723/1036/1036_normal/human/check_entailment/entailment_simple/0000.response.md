Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the maximum possible result of the game as described. It iterates through possible values of `b` that divide `n` evenly, calculates the sum of all previous values of `n`, and stops when `b` becomes 1. This process accurately reflects the game rules and results in the correct output for any given initial number of pebbles `n`.
