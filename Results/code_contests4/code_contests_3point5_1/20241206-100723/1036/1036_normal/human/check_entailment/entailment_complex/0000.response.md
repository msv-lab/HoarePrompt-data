Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always follow the problem description. It calculates the sum of all previous values of `n` divided by 2 while `n` is not equal to 1. However, the problem description specifically mentions the game process where the Beaver arranges the pebbles in equal rows and takes back one row each time until ending up with exactly one pebble. The program does not simulate this game process correctly.

Furthermore, the program does not handle the constraints related to the range of `n` as specified in the problem description. For example, for the input `n = 10`, the expected output should be 16 according to the problem description. However, the program outputs 12 which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not do what the problem description asks for and does not provide the correct output for all potential cases.
