Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user and calculates the maximum possible result of the game as described in the problem. 
- It uses a while loop to continue the game until `n` is equal to 1, which meets the condition specified in the problem description.
- The code calculates the sum of all previous values of `n` divided by 2 correctly by arranging the pebbles in rows as described in the problem.
- The code handles the case where the game ends when `b = 1` and correctly calculates the final result.
- The output hints also agree with the code by describing that the function reads an integer `n` and calculates the sum of all previous values of `n` divided by 2, which aligns with the actual logic of the code.
