The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user and performs a series of calculations based on the value of `n`. It calculates the sum of all previous values of `n` divided by 2 while `n` is not equal to 1. The function then prints the final calculated sum. The code does not handle any constraints related to the range of `n` (2 <= n <= 10^9) as indicated in the annotation. Additionally, the functionality does not provide any return value.
