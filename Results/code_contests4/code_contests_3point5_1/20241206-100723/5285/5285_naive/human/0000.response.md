Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n! for every potential case. The program has multiple issues such as incorrect variable usage, incorrect logic in calculating the trailing zeros, and inconsistent variable names (e.g., `izv` used as both integer and dictionary).

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
```
The expected output should be `3`, as 5! in base 2 is `1111000`, which has 3 trailing zeros. However, the program may not produce the correct output for this case due to the mentioned issues.
