Example Answer:
`newizv` is multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` will depend on the initial value of `newizv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on the initial value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on the initial value of `newizv`**
