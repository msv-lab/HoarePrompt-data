According to the code, the loop will execute `st` number of times. The loop stops when `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed. The loop stops when `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
