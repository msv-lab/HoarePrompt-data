According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated according to the formula newizv = newizv * 2 + 1, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is 1, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times**
