ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values where the value for key `b` is incremented by 1 and has at least one key-value pair, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`, `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `newk` is equal to `k`, `newn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
```
while True and i < 10:
    st = 0
    i += 1
    newizv = 0
    newnewk = newk
    while newnewk <= newn:
        newnewk *= newk
        st += 1
    if st == 0:
        break
    for i in range(st):
        newizv = newizv * 2 + 1
    while newn > newk ** st:
        izv += newizv
        newn = newn - newk ** st

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1), loop control variable `st` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, `izv` is not mentioned, `i` is -1, `newizv` is `2^0 - 1` which is 0, loop control variable `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `st` is equal to 0 after the loop finishes

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
