The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the result based on the provided constraints: **Precondition**: **n and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12**. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate and return the result based on the constraints mentioned for integers n and b.
