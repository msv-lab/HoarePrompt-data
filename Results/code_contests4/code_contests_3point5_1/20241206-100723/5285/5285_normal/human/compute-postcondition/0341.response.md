According to the code, the loop can execute if `st` is greater than 0. The loop iterates from 0 to `st-1`. Before the loop starts, `st` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. So the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is 1, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times.**
