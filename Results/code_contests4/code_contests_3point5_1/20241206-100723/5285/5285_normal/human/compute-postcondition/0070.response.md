According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk`, `st`, and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed. The loop stops when `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn` and `st` must be incremented by 1.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+2)`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
