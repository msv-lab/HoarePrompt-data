Example Answer:
`st` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The initial state of `st` is unknown, but it will increase by 1 with each iteration of the loop as long as the condition `newnewk <= newn` is satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`, loop continues as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`, loop continues as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1 in each iteration**
