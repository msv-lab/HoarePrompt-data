Example Answer:
`izv` is increased by `newizv`, but the initial values of `izv` and `newizv` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation such that it is greater than `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation such that it is greater than `newk`**
