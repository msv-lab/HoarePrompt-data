Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk`, `st`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration; `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.
Output State: **`newnewk`, `st`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration; `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
