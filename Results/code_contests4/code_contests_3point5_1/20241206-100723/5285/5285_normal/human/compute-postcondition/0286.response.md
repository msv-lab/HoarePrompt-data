Output State: **`st`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, the loop can execute one more time. `izv` is assigned the value 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
