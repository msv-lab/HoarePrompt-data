Example Answer:
The value of `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newn` is updated to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk, and `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newn` is updated to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
