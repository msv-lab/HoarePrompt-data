Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The value of `st` is greater than 0, so the result of the calculation will be subtracted from the current value of `newn`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation such that it is greater than `newk`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation such that it is greater than `newk`**
