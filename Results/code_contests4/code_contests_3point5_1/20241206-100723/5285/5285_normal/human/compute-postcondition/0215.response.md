According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `newnewk` should be less than `newn`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`st` is increased by 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk` for the loop to execute one more time `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`**
