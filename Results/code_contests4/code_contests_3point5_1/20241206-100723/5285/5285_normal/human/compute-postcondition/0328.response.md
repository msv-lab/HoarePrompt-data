According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` and `newk` raised to the power of 2, `newn` is 0. This implies that `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to the value of `newk` raised to the power of 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` raised to the power of 2, `izv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
