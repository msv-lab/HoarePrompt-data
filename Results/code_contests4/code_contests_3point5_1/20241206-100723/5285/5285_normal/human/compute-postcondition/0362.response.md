Example Answer:
`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, so `newnewk` now holds the same value as `newk`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times**
