According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, and `newk` is greater than `newn`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`. Additionally, `st` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `st` is incremented by 1**
