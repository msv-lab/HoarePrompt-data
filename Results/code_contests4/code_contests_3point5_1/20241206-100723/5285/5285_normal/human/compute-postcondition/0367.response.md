Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` in each iteration. The initial state does not change except for the new value of `newnewk`. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
