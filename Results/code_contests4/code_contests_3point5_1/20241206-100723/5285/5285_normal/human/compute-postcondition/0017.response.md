Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is either 3 or increased by 2. The value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
