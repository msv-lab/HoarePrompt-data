According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated to be greater than `newk - newk`, which simplifies to `newn` greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st` where `st` is the current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newn` is updated to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`**
