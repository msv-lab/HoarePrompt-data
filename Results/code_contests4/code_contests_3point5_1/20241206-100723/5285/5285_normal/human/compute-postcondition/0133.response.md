Example Answer: 
The value of `st` is increased by 1. The previous value of `st` is unknown, so after execution, `st` will be increased by 1. There are no other variables affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `st` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn`.
Output State: **variable `st` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn`**
