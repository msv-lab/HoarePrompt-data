According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `i` is increased by 2, `newizv` is `newizv` multiplied by 2 plus 1, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by the final value of `newnewk`, `newizv` is `newizv` multiplied by 2 plus 1**
