According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `st` is greater than 0, and `newizv` is updated based on its initial value multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `st`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
