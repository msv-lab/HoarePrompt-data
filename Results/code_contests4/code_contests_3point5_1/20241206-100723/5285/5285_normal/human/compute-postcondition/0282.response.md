Postcondition: ***`st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are all updated accordingly for the next iteration. If `res` is equal to -1, then the function executes the if part and updates the variables accordingly. Otherwise, the function executes the else part, and `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]` are still updated for the next iteration, but this time `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`.***
