Example Answer: 
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, so the value of `newnewk` changes accordingly. The condition for the loop execution remains the same. The value of `st` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^4`, for the loop to execute again `newk` is less than or equal to cubic root of `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^4`, for the loop to execute again `newk` is less than or equal to cubic root of `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1**
