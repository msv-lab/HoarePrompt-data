According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `st` being 0 means the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `st` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute**
