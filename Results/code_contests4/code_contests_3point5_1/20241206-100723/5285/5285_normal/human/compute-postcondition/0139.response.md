Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is less than `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1) + 1, loop control variable `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `newizv` is 0, `st` is equal to 0 after the if statement is executed, for the loop to execute the first time `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated to `newizv` multiplied by 2 + 1**
