According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Since the loop has a condition of `True and i < 10`, the loop will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, all the states can remain the same.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
