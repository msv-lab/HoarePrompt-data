Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated according to the formula newizv = newizv * 2 + 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` will depend on its initial value. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated according to the formula newizv = newizv * 2 + 1, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is 1, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated according to the formula newizv = newizv * 2 + 1, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is 1, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times**
