According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `res` and `mlt`. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are all updated for the next iteration. If `res` is equal to -1, then the function executes the if part and updates the variables accordingly. Otherwise, the function executes the else part and `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]` are still updated for the next iteration, but this time `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `res` should not be equal to -1 and `mlt` should be less than `res`.

State: **`st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, the loop can execute one more time**
