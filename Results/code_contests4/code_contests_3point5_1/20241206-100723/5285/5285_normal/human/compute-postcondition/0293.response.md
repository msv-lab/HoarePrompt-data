According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`. So, to execute the loop one more time, `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
