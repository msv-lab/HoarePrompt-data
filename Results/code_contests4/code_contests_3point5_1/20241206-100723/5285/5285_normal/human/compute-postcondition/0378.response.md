According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, `newizv` should be updated as described, `newn` must still be greater than `newk` squared, `izv` should be updated to include the new `newizv` value, `newk` should be squared, and `newnewk` should be updated based on the squared value of `newk`.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is updated, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is updated based on the squared value of `newk`**
