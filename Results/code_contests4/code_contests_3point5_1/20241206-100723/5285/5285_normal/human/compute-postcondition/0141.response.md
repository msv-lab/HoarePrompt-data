Example Answer: 
`newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2 + 1. Since the initial value of `newizv` is 0, after execution, `newizv` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is less than `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1, `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, for the loop to execute the second time `st` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is less than `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1, `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, for the loop to execute the second time `st` is greater than 1**
