Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, where `newk` is squared. The value of `newnewk` is updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times.**
