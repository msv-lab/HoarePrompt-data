Example Answer:
`newn` is assigned the value `newn - newk ** st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are known, so we can calculate the result. Therefore, after execution, `newn` will be updated based on the subtraction. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is 1, `newn` is updated based on the subtraction operation, `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `izv` is incremented by 1**
