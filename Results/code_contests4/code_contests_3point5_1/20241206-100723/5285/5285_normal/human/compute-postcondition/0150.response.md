Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk**st`, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv + 2^st - 1`, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, loop control variable `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1` for the loop to execute again**
