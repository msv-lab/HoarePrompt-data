Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, which means `newnewk` will be updated based on its previous value. If `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, then after execution it will become `newk^2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`, loop continues as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`, loop continues as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
