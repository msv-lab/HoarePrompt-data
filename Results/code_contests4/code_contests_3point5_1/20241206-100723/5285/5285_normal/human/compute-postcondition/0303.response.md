Postcondition: ***`st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` before it becomes greater than `newn`, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` multiplied `st` times, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0 and `st` is equal to 0***
