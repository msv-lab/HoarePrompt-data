Example Answer:
`izv` is added to `newizv`, but the initial value of `newizv` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` is greater than 1; `izv` is added to an unknown value.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` is greater than 1; `izv` is added to an unknown value**
