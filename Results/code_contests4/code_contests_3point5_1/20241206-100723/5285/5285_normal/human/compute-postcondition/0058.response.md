According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk`, `newn`, and `st`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`. To allow the loop to execute again, `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn` after the next iteration. Additionally, `st` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so it does not need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^2`, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1 in each iteration**
