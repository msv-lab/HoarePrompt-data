Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is -1, so after execution, `i` becomes 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared**
