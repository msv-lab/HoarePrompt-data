According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d_osn`. If there are more elements in `d_osn` that have not been iterated over, the loop can execute again. Given the conditions at the end of the previous iteration, the key factors for the next iteration are `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, and `d_osn[k]`.

Since the loop is iterating over `d_osn`, the next iteration will be for the next element in `d_osn`. At the end of the last iteration, all the variables have specific values based on the conditions. To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- `newnewk` needs to be updated accordingly.
- `newn` should be updated based on the previous conditions.
- `st` should be set to 0 for the start of the next iteration.
- Increment `izv` by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed.
- Set `i` to 9 for the next iteration.
- Calculate the new value of `newizv` based on the previous value.
- `st` should be updated based on the loop execution.
- Set `mlt` as the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`.
- If `res` was not equal to -1, update `res` and ensure that `mlt` is less than `res`.

State: **`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]` are adjusted accordingly for the next iteration**.
