Example Answer:
`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0**
