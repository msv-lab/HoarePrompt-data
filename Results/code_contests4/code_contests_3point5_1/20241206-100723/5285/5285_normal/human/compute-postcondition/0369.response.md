According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` must be less than or equal to `newn`**
