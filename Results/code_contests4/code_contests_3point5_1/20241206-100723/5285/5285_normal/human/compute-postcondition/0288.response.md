According to the code, the loop will always execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Since the loop will execute at least once, we need to adjust the states to ensure that it can execute one more time.

Based on the conditions provided:
1. `res` is not equal to -1
2. `mlt` is less than `res`

To execute the loop one more time:
- `res` should not be equal to -1
- `mlt` should be less than `res`

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`st`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` should not be equal to -1 and `mlt` should be less than `res`. `i` is 0, `izv` is assigned the value 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
