According to the code, the loop will always execute as it is a `while True` loop. The loop execution depends on the variable `i` being less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, and `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk. Since it is a `while True` loop, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk**.
