According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared. This condition ensures that the loop will execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk` squared**
