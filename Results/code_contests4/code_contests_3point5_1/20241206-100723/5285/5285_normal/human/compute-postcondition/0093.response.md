According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `newn` needs to be greater than `newk`
- `newnewk` needs to be multiplied by `newk`

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is 1, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`.**
