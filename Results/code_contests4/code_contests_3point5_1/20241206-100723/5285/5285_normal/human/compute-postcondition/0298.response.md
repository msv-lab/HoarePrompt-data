Example Answer:
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `st` is 1, after execution, `st` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0.
Output State: **`st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0**
