According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, and `newn` is updated based on the calculation. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `newn` needs to be updated based on the calculation, specifically `newn` should be greater than the new value of `newk ** st` after the increment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation such that it is greater than `newk ** st` for the loop to execute again**
