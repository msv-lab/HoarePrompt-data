Postcondition: ***`st`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk` are integers. If `st` is 0, then after the execution of the if block, `st` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, and `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by the final value of `newnewk`.***
