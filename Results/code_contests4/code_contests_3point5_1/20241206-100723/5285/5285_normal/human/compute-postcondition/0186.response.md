Postcondition: ***`newnewk` is the final value after being multiplied by `newk` repeatedly based on the loop conditions. If `st == 0`, then `newnewk` retains its final value, `st` is 0, and `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk`, and `newn` retain their initial values. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
