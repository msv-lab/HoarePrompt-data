According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, so `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` raised to the power of 2, `izv` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` squared, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
