Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are unknown, so the output state is: `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented**
