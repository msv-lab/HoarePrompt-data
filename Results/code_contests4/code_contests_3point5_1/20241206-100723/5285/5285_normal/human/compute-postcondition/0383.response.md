According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `newk` needs to be adjusted such that it is less than `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is less than `st`, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`**
