According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is squared, and `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newn` should be adjusted to be greater than `newk` squared. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times**
