Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. The initial value of `newizv` is used for the calculation. The loop will iterate another time, so `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value, `i` is incremented by 1**
