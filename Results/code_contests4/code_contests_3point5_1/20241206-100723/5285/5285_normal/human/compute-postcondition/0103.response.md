According to the code, in this case, the loop can execute as long as `st` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `st` is equal to 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `i` should be adjusted to 0. 
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute**
