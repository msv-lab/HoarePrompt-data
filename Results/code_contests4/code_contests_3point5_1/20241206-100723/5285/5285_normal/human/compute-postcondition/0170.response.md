Example Answer:
`st` is assigned the value 0, so the value of `st` is now 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk`, `st`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration; `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 0.
Output State: **`newnewk`, `st`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration; `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `st` is 0**
