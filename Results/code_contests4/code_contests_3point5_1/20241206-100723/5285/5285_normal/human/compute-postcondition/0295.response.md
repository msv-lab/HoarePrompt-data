Example Answer:
`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same as they are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
