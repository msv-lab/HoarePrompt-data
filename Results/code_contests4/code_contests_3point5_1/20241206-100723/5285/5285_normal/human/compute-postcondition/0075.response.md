According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, which means `newk^(st+1)` needs to be greater than `newk^st`. This implies `newk` must be greater than 1 and `st` must be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` is greater than 1**
