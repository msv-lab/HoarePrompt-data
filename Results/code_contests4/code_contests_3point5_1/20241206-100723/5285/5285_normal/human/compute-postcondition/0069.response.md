Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by doubling its current value and adding 1. The previous values of `newizv` and other variables are unknown. The loop will continue until `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. If `st` is 0, we will break out of the loop. 
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed. The loop stops when `newnewk` exceeds `newn`. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
