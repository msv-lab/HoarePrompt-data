Postcondition: ***`st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to reach a value greater than `newn`, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is 1, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times. If `st` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
