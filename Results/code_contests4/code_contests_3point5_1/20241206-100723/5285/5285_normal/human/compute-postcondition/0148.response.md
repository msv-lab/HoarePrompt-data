According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `newn` is greater than `newk`, and `st` is the final value it reached after the loop. To ensure the loop can execute again, `newn` needs to be updated to `newn - newk` and `st` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is greater than `newk`, `izv` is updated to `izv + newizv`, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, loop control variable `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `st` is equal to 0 after the loop finishes, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1**.
