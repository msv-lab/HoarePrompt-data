Example Answer:
`newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The previous values of the variables are not given, but based on the initial state, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, and `st` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newn` is updated with the calculation `newn - newk ** st`, and `izv` is added to an unknown value.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newn` is updated with a calculation, `izv` is added to an unknown value**
