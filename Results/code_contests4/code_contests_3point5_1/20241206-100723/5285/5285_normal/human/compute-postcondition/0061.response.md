According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`. So, for the loop to execute again, `newk^3` must be less than or equal to `newn`, which means `newk` must be less than or equal to the cubic root of `newn`. Additionally, `st` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so `st` must be incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^3`, for the loop to execute again `newk` is less than or equal to cubic root of `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1**
