Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 1, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1) + 1, loop control variable `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must be equal to or greater than `newn`**
