According to the code, the loop will always execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be either 1 or any value less than 10. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk`, `st`, `izv` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration; `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
