According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `newn` needs to be updated to `newn - newk`.
- `izv` needs to be increased by `newizv`.
- `st` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by loop execution count, `newn` is updated based on loop execution count, `i` is increased by `st`, `newizv` is `newizv` multiplied by 2 to the power of `st` plus `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk` and for the loop to execute one more time `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`.**
