Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added, `newn` is 0, `i` is 10, `newnewk` is adjusted for the next iteration, `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `mlt` is calculated as the integer division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`, and `res` is equal to the value of `mlt`**
