According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk`, `newn`, and `st`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `st` is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be increased to be greater than `newk`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`**
