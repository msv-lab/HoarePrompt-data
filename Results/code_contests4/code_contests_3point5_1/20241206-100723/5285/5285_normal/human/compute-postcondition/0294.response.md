Example Answer: 
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and the previous value of `newnewk` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.**
