Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, and the value of `newk` is squared. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`st` is 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`**
