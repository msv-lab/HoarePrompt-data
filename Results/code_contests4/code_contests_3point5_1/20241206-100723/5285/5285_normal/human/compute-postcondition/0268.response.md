Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by `newizv`, where `newizv` is updated based on its initial value multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `st`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated based on the subtraction of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated based on the subtraction of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
