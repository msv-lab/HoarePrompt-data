According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`
- `st` is the total number of times the loop executed (incremented by 1)
- `newn` is updated after subtraction
- `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed
- `i` is 0
- `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `2^st + (2^st - 1)`
- `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute
- `izv` is updated with the addition of `newizv`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Increment `st` by 1
- Update `newnewk` to `newk^(st+1)`
- Update `newn` after subtraction
- Increment `izv` by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed
- Update `newizv` to its previous value multiplied by `2^st + (2^st - 1)`
- Update `izv` with the addition of `newizv`

State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed (incremented by 1), `newn` is updated after subtraction, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `2^st + (2^st - 1)`, `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `izv` is updated with the addition of `newizv`**
