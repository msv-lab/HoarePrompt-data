Output State: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`, `res` is either -1 or a different value depending on the conditions inside the loop.
