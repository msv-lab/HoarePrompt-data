According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `st` is 0 and `newk` is retained its initial value. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` needs to be greater than 1. 

State: **`newizv` is the final value after being multiplied by `newk` repeatedly based on the loop conditions, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, if `st == 0` then `newnewk` retains its final value, `st` is 0, `izv` is not changed, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk`, and `newn` retain their initial values, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than 1**
