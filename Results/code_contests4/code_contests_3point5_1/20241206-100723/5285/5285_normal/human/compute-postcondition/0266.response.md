The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The initial values of `newn`, `newk`, `st` are known. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `newn` will be calculated. 
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated based on the subtraction of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
