Example Answer:
`newn` is updated to the result of `newn - newk` raised to the power of `st`. The value of `newn` is already greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1` for the loop to execute again. `st` is incremented by 1. The value of `izv` is not mentioned in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1, `newn` is updated, and `izv` is not mentioned.
Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is incremented by 1, `newn` is updated, and `izv` is not mentioned**
