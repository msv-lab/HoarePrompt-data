Postcondition: ***`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`. When `st` equals 0, the program resets all the values to their initial state and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
