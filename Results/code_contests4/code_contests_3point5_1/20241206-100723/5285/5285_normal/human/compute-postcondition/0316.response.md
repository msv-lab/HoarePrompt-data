According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than the result of `newk ** st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `newizv` is 1, `newn` is updated, `newk` is raised to the power of `st + 1`, and `izv` is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is 1, `newn` is updated, `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `izv` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk ** (st+1)`**
