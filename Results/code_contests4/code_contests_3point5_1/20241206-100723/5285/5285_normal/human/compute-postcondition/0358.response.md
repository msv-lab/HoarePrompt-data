According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `st - 1` and `st` is greater than 0. So, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than 10, which means `st - 1` should be less than 10. Therefore, `st` needs to be less than or equal to 9. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`st` is less than or equal to 9, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared**
