According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` and `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` must have been less than or equal to the initial value of `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` must have been less than or equal to the initial value of `newn`**
