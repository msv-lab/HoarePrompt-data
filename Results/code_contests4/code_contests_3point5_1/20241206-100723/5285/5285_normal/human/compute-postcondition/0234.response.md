Example Answer:
`newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`, where `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are variables. The value of `st` is greater than 0, so the result of `newk ** st` will be calculated and subtracted from `newn`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation**
