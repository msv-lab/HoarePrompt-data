Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value 3. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1, `cur` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1, `cur` is 3**
