Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` is updated, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is less than `st`, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, for the loop to execute again `newk` is less than or equal to `st`, and `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
