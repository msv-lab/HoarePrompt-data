Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `st` is incremented by 1, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute again `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `st` is incremented by 1, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
