According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `st` which is at least 1 and equal to 1. Therefore, `i` is less than 10 and the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `izv` is equal to the sum of all `newizv` values added in each iteration of the loop**
