Example Answer: 
`newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and the value of `k` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `izv` is 0, `i`, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.
Output State: **`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `izv` is 0, `i`, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration**
