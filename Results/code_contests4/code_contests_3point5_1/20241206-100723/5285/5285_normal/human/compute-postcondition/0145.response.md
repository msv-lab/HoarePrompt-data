According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newn` is less than `newk`, so it needs to be adjusted to `newn` is greater than `newk`. Additionally, `st` is equal to 0 after the loop finishes, so for the loop to execute the first time, `st` should be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is greater than `newk`, `izv` is `newizv` multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1) + 1 times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, loop control variable `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `st` is equal to 0 after the loop finishes**
