Postcondition: ***`n`, `b` are integers, `n` is between 1 and 10^18, `b` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. If `cur` is 2, all variables retain their initial values. If `cur` is not 2, then `cur` is incremented by 2 while all other variables remain the same.***
