According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again: 
- `newn` needs to be updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` once more.
- `izv` needs to be incremented by `newizv`.
- `newn` needs to be greater than `newk ** st`.
State: **`st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is 1, `newn` is updated, `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `izv` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `newn` must be greater than `newk, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
