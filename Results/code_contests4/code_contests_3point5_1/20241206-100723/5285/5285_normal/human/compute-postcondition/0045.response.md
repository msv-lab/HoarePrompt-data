According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the dictionary `d_osn` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the dictionary `d_osn` must have at least one key-value pair. 

In order for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values where the value for key `b` is incremented by 1 and has at least one key-value pair, `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of the original value of `b`, `izv` is a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0, `res` is -1**
