Example Answer:
`izv` is updated by adding the value of `newizv`. The values of `izv` and `newizv` are unknown, so the new value of `izv` cannot be determined. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newn` is updated to be greater than `newk`, `izv` is updated by an unknown value.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newn` is updated to be greater than `newk`, `izv` is updated by an unknown value**
