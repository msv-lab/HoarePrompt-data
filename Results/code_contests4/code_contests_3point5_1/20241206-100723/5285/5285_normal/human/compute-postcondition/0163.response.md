Postcondition: ***`newnewk`, `newn`, `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]` are all integers. If `res` is equal to -1, then `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 9, `newizv` is the previous value multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1), `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `st` is equal to 0 after the loop finishes, `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`, and `res` is equal to the value of `mlt`. If `res` is not equal to -1, then `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is 0, `newn` is updated to `newn - newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 9, `newizv` is the previous value multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1), `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `st` is equal to 0 after the loop finishes, `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`, `res` is not equal to -1, `res` is assigned the value of `mlt`, and the value of `mlt` is less than `res`.***
