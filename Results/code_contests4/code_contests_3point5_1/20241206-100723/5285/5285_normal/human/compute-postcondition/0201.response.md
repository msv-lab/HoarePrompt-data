Example Answer:
The value of `newizv` is added to `izv`, so `izv` is updated accordingly. The variables `newn` and `newk` are not mentioned in the provided code snippet, so their values remain unchanged. The loop will only execute again if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, but this condition is not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is added to `izv`, `newn` is unchanged, `newk` is unchanged.
Output State: **`newizv` is added to `izv`, `newn` is unchanged, `newk` is unchanged**
