Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by `newizv`, where `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1`. Since `st` is 1, `newizv` will be 1. Therefore, `izv` will be incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is 1, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`, `izv` is incremented by 1**
