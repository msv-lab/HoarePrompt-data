Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0**
