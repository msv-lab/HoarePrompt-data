Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st` - 1, `newizv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is less than `st`, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`**
