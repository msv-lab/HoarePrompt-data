According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0. Since the loop starts from 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on the initial value of `newizv`, for the loop to execute another time `i` is incremented by 1**
