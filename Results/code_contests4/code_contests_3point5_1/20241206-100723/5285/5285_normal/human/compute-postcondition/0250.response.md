According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 0 and `newn` is equal or greater than 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than 1 or equal to 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`st` is 2, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal or greater than 1, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is 0, `newn` is equal or greater than 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than 1**
