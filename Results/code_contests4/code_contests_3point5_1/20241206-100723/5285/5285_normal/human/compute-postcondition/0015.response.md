Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. If `b` is divisible by `cur`, `cur` is the key in `d_osn` and its value is incremented by 1, `cur` is set to 2, and `b` is divided by `cur`. Otherwise, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is either 3 or increased by 2.***
