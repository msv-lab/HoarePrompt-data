Example Answer: 
`cur` is assigned the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2**
