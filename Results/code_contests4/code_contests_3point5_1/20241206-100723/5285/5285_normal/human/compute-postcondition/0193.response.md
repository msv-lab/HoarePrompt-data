Output State: **`newizv` is the final value after being multiplied by `newk` repeatedly based on the loop conditions, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, if `st == 0` then `newnewk` retains its final value, `st` is 0, `izv` is not changed, `mlt`, `res`, `d_osn[k]`, `newk`, and `newn` retain their initial values**
