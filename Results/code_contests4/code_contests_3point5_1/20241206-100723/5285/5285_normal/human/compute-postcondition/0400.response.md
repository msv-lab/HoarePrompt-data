Postcondition: ***`st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`, `mlt` is less than `res`. If `mlt` is less than `res`, then the program retains its initial state.***
