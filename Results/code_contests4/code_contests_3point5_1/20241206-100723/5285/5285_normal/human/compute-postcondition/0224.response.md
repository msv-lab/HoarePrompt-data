According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executed. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `st` should remain greater than 0
- `izv` should be updated by adding `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed
- `newn` should be updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed
- `i` should be increased by the number of times the loop executed
- `newizv` should be updated to `newizv` multiplied by 2 plus 1
- `newnewk` should be assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by the final value of `newnewk`

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is `newizv` multiplied by 2 plus 1, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by the final value of `newnewk`**
