Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The other variables remain the same, so the Output State is: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed (incremented by 1), `newn` is updated after subtraction, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `2^st + (2^st - 1)`, `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `izv` is updated with the addition of `newizv`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed (incremented by 1), `newn` is updated after subtraction, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `2^st + (2^st - 1)`, `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `izv` is updated with the addition of `newizv`**
