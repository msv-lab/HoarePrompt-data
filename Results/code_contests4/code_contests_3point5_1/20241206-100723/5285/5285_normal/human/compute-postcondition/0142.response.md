According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, which is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `st` must still be greater than 1. 
State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is less than `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1, for the loop to execute the third time `st` is greater than 1**
