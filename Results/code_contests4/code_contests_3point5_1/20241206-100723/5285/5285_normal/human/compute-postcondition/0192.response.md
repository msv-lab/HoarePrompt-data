Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its value by 2 and adding 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value depends on the initial value. `i` is increased by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is updated, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`newizv` is updated, `i` is increased by 1**
