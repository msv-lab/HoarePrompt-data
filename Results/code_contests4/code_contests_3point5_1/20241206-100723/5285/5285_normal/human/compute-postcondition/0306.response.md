According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`st` is at least 1, `st` is equal to 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `newk` is less than `n`, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` multiplied `st` times, `izv` is 0**
