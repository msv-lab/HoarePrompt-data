Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value 0. The value of `newizv` is 0, so after execution, `newizv` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0**
