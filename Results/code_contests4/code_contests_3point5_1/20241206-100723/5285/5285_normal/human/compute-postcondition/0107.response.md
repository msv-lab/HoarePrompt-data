According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows: `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed + 1, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed + 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2 + 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed + 2, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed + 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1, `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2 + 1**
