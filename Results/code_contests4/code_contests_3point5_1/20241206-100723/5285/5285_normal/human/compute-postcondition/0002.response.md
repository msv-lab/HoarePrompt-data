Example Answer:
The code creates a defaultdict named `d_osn` with integer values. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values**
