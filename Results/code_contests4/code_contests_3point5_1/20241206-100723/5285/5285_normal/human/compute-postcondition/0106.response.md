Output State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed + 1, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed + 1, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1, `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2 + 1**
