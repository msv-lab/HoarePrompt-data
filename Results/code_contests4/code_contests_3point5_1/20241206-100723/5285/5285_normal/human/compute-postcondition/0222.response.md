According to the code, the loop will execute if `st` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the initial values of `st`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk` are given. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `st` needs to be greater than 0. Additionally, after the execution of the loop, the values of `st`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `newizv`, and `newnewk` will be updated based on the described logic.

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by the final value of `newnewk`**
