Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. If `b % cur == 0`, the value at key `cur` in `d_osn` is incremented by 1. If `b % cur != 0` and `cur` is 2, all variables retain their initial values. If `b % cur != 0` and `cur` is not 2, `cur` is incremented by 2 while all other variables remain the same. After the execution of the if else block, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
