According to the code, the loop will execute `st` number of times. Before the loop starts, the initial states of the variables need to be set for the loop to execute. The initial state should be such that `st` is greater than 0. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`**.
