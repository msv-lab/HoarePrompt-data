Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `i` is increased by `st`, `newizv` is `newizv` multiplied by 2 to the power of `st` plus `2^st - 1`, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `2^st - 1`**
