Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `b`, then calculates and outputs a result based on the provided constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^12. It iterates through prime factors of `b`, performs calculations, and finally prints the minimum value obtained from the calculations.**
