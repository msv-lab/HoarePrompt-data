Example Answer:
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 1, so after execution, `st` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 2, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is 0, `d_osn[k]` is 0, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
