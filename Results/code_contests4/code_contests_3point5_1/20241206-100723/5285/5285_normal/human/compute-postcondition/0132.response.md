Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. The previous values of `newnewk` and `newk` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `st` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn.
Output State: **variable `st` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn**
