According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `st`, `newn` may change, and `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented**
