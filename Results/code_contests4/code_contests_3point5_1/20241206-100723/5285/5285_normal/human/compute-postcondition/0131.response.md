According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `st` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn**
