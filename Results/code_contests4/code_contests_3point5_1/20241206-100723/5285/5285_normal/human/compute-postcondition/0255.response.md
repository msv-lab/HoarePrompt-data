Output State: **`st` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal or greater than 1, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is 0, `newn` is equal or greater than 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0, the loop control variable `newnewk` will be such that `newnewk` is greater than `newn`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
