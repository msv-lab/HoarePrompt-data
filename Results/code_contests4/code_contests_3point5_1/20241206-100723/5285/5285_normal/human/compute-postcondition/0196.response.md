Example Answer: 
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not given in the initial state, so the updated value of `newn` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is added to `izv`, other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`newizv` is added to `izv`, other variables remain unchanged**
