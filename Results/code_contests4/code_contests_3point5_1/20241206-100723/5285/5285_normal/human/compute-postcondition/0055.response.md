According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be less than `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`, for the loop to execute the first time `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`**
