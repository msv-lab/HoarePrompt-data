According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newizv` is added to `izv`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newizv` is added to `izv`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
