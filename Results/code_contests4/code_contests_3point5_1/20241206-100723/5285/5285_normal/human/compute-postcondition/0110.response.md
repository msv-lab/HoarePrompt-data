According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `st` is greater than 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `st` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed (incremented by 1), `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1), `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute**
