According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value, `i` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than `st`.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is updated based on its initial value, `i` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
