According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `izv` is updated, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is updated based on the squared value of `newk`, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1**
