Example Answer:
`n` and `b` are assigned values from the list comprehension [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]. The values of `n` and `b` are integers with the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12**
