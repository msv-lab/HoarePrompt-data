According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, and `newn` is assigned the value of `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `newk` should be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0**
