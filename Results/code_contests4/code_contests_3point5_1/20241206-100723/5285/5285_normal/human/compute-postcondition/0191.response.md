According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newizv` is updated, all other variables retain their initial values. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, and `st` should remain the same.
State: **`newizv` is updated, `i` is increased by 1, all other variables retain their initial values**
