According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `st` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `newizv` needs to be updated to its previous value multiplied by `2^st + (2^st - 1)`.
- `izv` needs to be updated with the addition of `newizv`.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed (incremented by 1), `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 0, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `2^st + (2^st - 1)`, `st` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `izv` is updated with the addition of `newizv`**.
