Output State: **`st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to `n`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is the product of `newnewk` and `newk`, `i` is 1, `izv` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`**
