Example Answer:
`newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`, where `newk` and `st` are used for calculations. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are unknown, so the output state is: `newizv` is added to `izv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation `newn - newk ** st`.
Output State: **`newizv` is added to `izv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation `newn - newk ** st`**
