According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`st` is at least 1, `st` is equal to 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `newk` is less than `n`, `newnewk` is the product of `newk` multiplied `st` times, `izv` is 0, `newizv` is calculated as `newizv * 2 + 1**
