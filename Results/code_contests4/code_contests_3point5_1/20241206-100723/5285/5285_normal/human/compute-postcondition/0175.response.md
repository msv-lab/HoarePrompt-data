Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, where `newk` is the original value of `newnewk`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `st` is 0, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is 0, `d_osn[k]` is 0, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `st` is 0, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is 0, `d_osn[k]` is 0, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
