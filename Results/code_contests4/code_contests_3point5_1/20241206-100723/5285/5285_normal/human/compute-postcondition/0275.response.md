Example Answer:
The value of `mlt` is calculated as the integer division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`. The previous values of `izv` and `d_osn[k]` are unknown, so the output state is: `st` is greater than 0, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added, `newn` is 0, `i` is 10, `newnewk` is adjusted for the next iteration, `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `mlt` is calculated as the integer division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added, `newn` is 0, `i` is 10, `newnewk` is adjusted for the next iteration, `st`, `izv`, `i`, `newizv`, `newnewk`, `newn` are updated accordingly for the next iteration, `mlt` is calculated as the integer division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`**
