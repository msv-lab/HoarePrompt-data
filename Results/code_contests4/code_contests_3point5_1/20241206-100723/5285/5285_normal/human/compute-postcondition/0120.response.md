According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, so it will always execute. However, the loop also depends on the variable `i` being less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than 10. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is equal to `newk`, `st` is 0, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is less than 10, `newizv` is updated to its previous value multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1), loop control variable `st` is 0**
