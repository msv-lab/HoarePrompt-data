According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to `newk^(st+1)` which implies that `newk` is being raised to a power greater than `1`, `newn` is less than or equal to `newk`. To execute the loop one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk` and `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to be `newnewk * newk`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is now `newnewk * newk`, `st` is 2, `newn` is greater than `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0**
