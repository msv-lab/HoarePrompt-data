Example Answer: 
`newizv` is updated to be twice its previous value plus 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` is dependent on the previous value. `i` is increased by 1. The value of `st` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `newizv` is updated based on its previous value, `i` is increased by 1, `st` remains the same.
Output State: **`newizv` is updated based on its previous value, `i` is increased by 1, `st` remains the same**
