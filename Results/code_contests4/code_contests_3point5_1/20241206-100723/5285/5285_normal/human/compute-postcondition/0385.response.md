Example Answer:
`newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The value of `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, and the value of `st` is used in the calculation. After execution, the value of `newn` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` is updated, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values added in the loop, `newk` is less than `st`, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `newnewk` by the squared value of `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
