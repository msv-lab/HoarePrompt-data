According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newn` should be adjusted to be greater than `newnewk`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`st` is increased by 1, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation of `newn - newk`, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk` and for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newnewk`**
