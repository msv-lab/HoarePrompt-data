According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newizv` is updated to be twice its previous value plus 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `newizv` needs to be updated again to be twice its previous value plus 1.
State: **`newizv` is updated to be twice its previous value plus 1, for the loop to execute another time `i` is increased by 1, `st` remains the same**
