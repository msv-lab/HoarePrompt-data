According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, so to ensure the loop executes one more time, `newnewk` needs to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is 2, `izv` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `mlt` is 0, `res` is 0, `d_osn[k]` is 0, `newk` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
