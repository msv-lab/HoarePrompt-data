Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1. If b % cur == 0, then `b` is updated based on the division by `cur`. If b % cur != 0 and `cur` equals 2, then the program continues with the same initial state. If b % cur != 0 and `cur` is increased by 2, then the program continues with the updated value of `cur`.**
