Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `izv` is increased by `newizv` multiplied by the total number of loop executions, `newn` is updated based on the final calculation, `i` is increased by `st`, `newizv` is calculated based on the final value of `st`, `newnewk` is assigned the final value, `newn` is less than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
