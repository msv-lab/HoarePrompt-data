Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values. If `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is either 3 or increased by 2.***
