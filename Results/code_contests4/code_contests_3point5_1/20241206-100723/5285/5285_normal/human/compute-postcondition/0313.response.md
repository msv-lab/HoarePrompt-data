According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `st` is at least 1 but is equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1` and assigned the value of `2^st - 1`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`.
State: **`st` is at least 1 and equal to 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is calculated as `2^st - 1` and assigned the value of `2^st - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st + 1`**
