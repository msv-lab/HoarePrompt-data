According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `b` is greater than 1**
