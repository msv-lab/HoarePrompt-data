Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is less than `newk`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv` times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1, for the loop to execute the third time `st` is greater than 1, `newizv` is now calculated as `newizv * 2 + 1`.**
