Example Answer:
`d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `d_osn` and `cur` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and for the loop to execute again, `b` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^12, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and for the loop to execute again, `b` is greater than 1**
