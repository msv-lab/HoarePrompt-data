Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute `newn` is greater than `newk` squared.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute `newn` is greater than `newk` squared**
