Example Answer:
The value of `b` is divided by `cur`, resulting in a new value for `b`. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `d_osn` are not affected. Since `b` is divided by `cur`, the new value of `b` is dependent on the value of `cur`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is updated based on the division by `cur`, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, and for the loop to execute again, `b` is greater than 1**
