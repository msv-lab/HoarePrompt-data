Example Answer:
`newn` is assigned the value of `newn - newk ** st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided, so the output state is: `newizv` is added to `izv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation, `newk` is unchanged.
Output State: **`newizv` is added to `izv`, `newn` is updated based on the calculation, `newk` is unchanged**
