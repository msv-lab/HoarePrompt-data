According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is less than 1 and `newnewk` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be equal or greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal or greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newk` is 0, `newn` is equal or greater than 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is 0**
