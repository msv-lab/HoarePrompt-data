Output State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk`, `newn`, `mlt`, `d_osn[k]`, `res` are updated accordingly for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` should not be equal to -1 and `mlt` should be less than `res`. `i` is 1, `izv` is assigned the value 0, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`**
