Output State: **`newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newn` is less than `newk`, `izv` is `newizv` multiplied by 2^st + (2^st - 1) + 1 times the total number of times the loop executed, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, loop control variable `st` is the final value it reached after the loop, `st` is equal to 0 after the loop finishes**
