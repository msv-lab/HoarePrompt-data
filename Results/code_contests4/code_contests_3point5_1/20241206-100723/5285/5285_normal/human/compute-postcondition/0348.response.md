According to the code, the loop can execute if `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. Right before the loop, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` squared
- `newk` needs to be squared
- `newnewk` needs to be recalculated based on the updated `newk`
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `newn` is greater or equal to `newk` squared, `izv` is 1, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself `st` times, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk` squared, `newk` is squared, `newnewk` is recalculated**
