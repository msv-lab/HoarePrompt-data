Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers as input, n and b, calculates the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!, and prints the result. The program uses loops to calculate the values needed based on the given formula and logic. It considers different scenarios for calculating the trailing zeros based on the base provided.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
