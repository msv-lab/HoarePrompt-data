The function `func_4` recursively prints the key value of each node in a tree starting from the given `node`. It traverses the tree in a depth-first manner, printing the key of the current node followed by its left child node (if it exists) and then its right child node (if it exists). The functionality of the function is to traverse the tree in a depth-first manner and print the key values of all nodes.
