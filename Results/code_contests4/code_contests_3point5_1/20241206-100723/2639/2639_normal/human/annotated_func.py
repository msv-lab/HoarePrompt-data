    #The program returns the value of 'top' after the specified operations on 'x', 'y', and 'z'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, 'top' and 'z', where 'top' is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, and 'z' represents the operations to be performed. The function iterates through the nodes until 'x' is not an instance of Node anymore, updates the parent of 'z' to 'y', and appropriately assigns 'z' as the left or right child of 'y' based on the comparison of keys. Finally, the function returns the updated value of 'top'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`, where `node` represents a node in a tree structure, and `key` is an integer value being searched for within the tree. The function traverses the tree starting from the given `node` and searches for the `key` value. It returns True if the key is found, False otherwise, and continues the search recursively in the left and right child nodes. The annotations accurately describe the functionality of the function, covering all potential cases.

If node.right exists, the program performs certain operations based on the condition of the node.right.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `node` which represents a non-negative integer `m` indicating the number of operations. Each operation is denoted by insert `k`, find `k`, or print, where `k` is an integer within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The function recursively performs operations on the left and right nodes of the input `node` based on their existence. There is no explicit return value, and the functionality is to execute operations based on the input values within the specified range.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *the program prints an empty space followed by the value of `node.key`. If `node.left` is true, the function continues with the left child node. Otherwise, the function terminates. If `node.right` is true, the function continues with the right child node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` recursively prints the key value of each node in a tree starting from the given `node`. It traverses the tree in a depth-first manner, printing the key of the current node followed by its left child node (if it exists) and then its right child node (if it exists). The functionality of the function is to traverse the tree in a depth-first manner and print the key values of all nodes.
