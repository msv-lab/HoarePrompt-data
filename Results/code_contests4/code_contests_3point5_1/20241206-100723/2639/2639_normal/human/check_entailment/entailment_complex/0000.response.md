Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the implementation of the `find` operation. The `func_2` function is supposed to search for a node containing a specific key in the binary search tree, and return "yes" if found and "no" if not found. However, the `func_2` function does not return any values based on the problem description. 

Additionally, there is no function provided to handle the `print` operation as described in the problem description. The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are intended to print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively, but they are not called within the program to fulfill the print operation requirement.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
