Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description for the "print" operation. The description states that the keys of the binary search tree should be printed by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk on separate lines. However, the code prints both inorder and preorder traversal keys on the same line without any separation. This inconsistency in the output format makes the code incorrect as it does not meet the specified requirements for the "print" operation.
