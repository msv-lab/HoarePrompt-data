Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of four functions that implement the operations required by the problem description: insert, find, and print for a binary search tree. 

1. The `func_1` function correctly inserts a new node into the binary search tree by traversing the tree to find the correct position for insertion based on the key value. It maintains the binary search tree property of lesser keys on the left and greater keys on the right.

2. The `func_2` function correctly finds a node with a specific key in the binary search tree by recursively traversing the tree based on the key comparison. It returns True if the node with the key is found and False otherwise.

3. The `func_3` function correctly performs an inorder tree walk by recursively traversing the binary search tree in left-root-right order and printing the keys. 

4. The `func_4` function correctly performs a preorder tree walk by recursively traversing the binary search tree in root-left-right order and printing the keys.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, including inserting nodes, finding nodes, and printing the keys in inorder and preorder tree walks. The functions are implemented correctly and adhere to the constraints and specifications of the problem description.
