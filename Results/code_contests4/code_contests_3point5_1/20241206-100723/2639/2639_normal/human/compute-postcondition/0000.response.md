Example Answer:
The code prints an empty space followed by the value of `node.key` without a new line character. The value of `node.key` is unknown in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: the program prints an empty space followed by the value of `node.key`.
Output State: **the program prints an empty space followed by the value of `node.key`**
