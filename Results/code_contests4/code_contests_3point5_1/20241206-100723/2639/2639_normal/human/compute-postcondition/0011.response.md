Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`, where `node` represents a node in a tree structure, and `key` is an integer value being searched for within the tree. The function traverses the tree starting from the given `node` and searches for the `key` value. It returns True if the key is found, False otherwise, and continues the search recursively in the left and right child nodes. The annotations accurately describe the functionality of the function, covering all potential cases.**
