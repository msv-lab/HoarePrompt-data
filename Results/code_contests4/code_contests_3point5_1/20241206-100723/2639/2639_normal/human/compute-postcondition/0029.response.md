Postcondition: ***After the execution of the code block, `x` is no longer an instance of Node. `y` holds the last instance of Node before `x` is not an instance of Node anymore. `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. If `y` is None, `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None, and `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z` and `y.left` now points to the instance of Node `z`. If `z.key` is not less than `y.key`, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.***
