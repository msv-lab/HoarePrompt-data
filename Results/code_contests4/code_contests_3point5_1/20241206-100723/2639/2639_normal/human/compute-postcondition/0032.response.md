Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two parameters, 'top' and 'z', where 'top' is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, and 'z' represents the operations to be performed. The function iterates through the nodes until 'x' is not an instance of Node anymore, updates the parent of 'z' to 'y', and appropriately assigns 'z' as the left or right child of 'y' based on the comparison of keys. Finally, the function returns the updated value of 'top'.**
