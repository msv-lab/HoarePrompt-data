According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` being an instance of Node. If `x` is an instance of Node, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is either updated to become the left child node or to point to the Node to the right of its previous value. 
Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to remain an instance of Node.
State: **`y` and `x` are instances of Node, for the loop to execute again `x` needs to remain an instance of Node**
