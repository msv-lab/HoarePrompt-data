Output State: **After the execution of the code, `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. `y.left` now points to the instance of Node `z`. `x` is no longer an instance of Node. `y` still holds the last instance of Node before `x` is not an instance of Node anymore. `z.parent` is still assigned the value of `y`. `z.key` is still less than `y.key`.**
