Example Answer:
The variable `x` is reassigned to the object referenced by `x.right`. The previous value of `x` is unknown, but now `x` points to the object to the right of the previous `x` object. The variable `y` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an instance of Node after moving to the right, `y` is an instance of Node.
Output State: **`x` is an instance of Node after moving to the right, `y` is an instance of Node**
