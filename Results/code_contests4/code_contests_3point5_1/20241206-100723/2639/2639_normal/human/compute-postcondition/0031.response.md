The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, 'top' and 'z'. 'top' is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, and 'z' is an integer representing the operations to be performed. Each operation can be insert k, find k, or print, where k is an integer such that -2,000,000,000 <= k <= 2,000,000,000. The program returns the value of 'top' after performing the specified operations on 'x', 'y', and 'z'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the number of operations 'top' and the operations 'z', and return the value of 'top' after performing the specified operations. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, 'top' and 'z', where 'top' is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations and 'z' represents the operations to be performed. The function returns the value of 'top' after performing the specified operations on 'x', 'y', and 'z'.**
