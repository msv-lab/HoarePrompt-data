Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `x`, and `x` is an instance of Node, so after execution, `y` also becomes an instance of Node. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an instance of Node, `y` is also an instance of Node.
Output State: **`x` is an instance of Node, `y` is also an instance of Node**
