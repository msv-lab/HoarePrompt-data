The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`. `node` represents a node in a tree structure, and `key` is an integer value that we are searching for within the tree. 

Case_1: The program returns False. 

Case_2: If the key of the current node matches the provided key, the program returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

Case_3: The program returns the result of recursively calling `func_2` on the left child of the current node with the key value. 

Case_4: The program returns the result of calling `func_2` on the right child of the current node with the key value provided. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to traverse a tree structure starting from the given `node`, searching for the `key` value. It returns True if the key is found, False otherwise, and continues the search recursively in the left and right child nodes.
