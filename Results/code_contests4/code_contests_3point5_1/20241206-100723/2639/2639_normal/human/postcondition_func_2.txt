The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `node` which represents a non-negative integer `m` indicating the number of operations. Each operation is denoted by insert `k`, find `k`, or print, where `k` is an integer within the range of -2,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. The function recursively performs operations on the left and right nodes of the input `node` based on their existence. There is no explicit return value, and the functionality is to execute operations based on the input values within the specified range.
