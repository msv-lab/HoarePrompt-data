Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the operations on a binary search tree as described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function properly inserts a node with the given key into the binary search tree, the `func_2` function correctly finds whether a node with a given key exists in the tree, and the `func_3` and `func_4` functions correctly perform inorder and preorder tree walks respectively.

The program reads input according to the specified format, processes the operations correctly, and outputs the expected results for each find and print operation. The implementation of the binary search tree operations seems to be accurate and follows the constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the provided problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
