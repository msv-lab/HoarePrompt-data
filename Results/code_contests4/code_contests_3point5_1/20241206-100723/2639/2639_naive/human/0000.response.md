Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly inserts nodes into the binary search tree and maintains the properties of a binary search tree.
2. The program correctly implements the find operation by recursively searching for the key in the binary search tree.
3. The program correctly prints the keys of the binary search tree using inorder and preorder tree walks.
4. The program handles the input according to the problem description for all potential cases.
5. The program has a complexity that satisfies the constraints given in the problem description.
