The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by a sequence of `n` integers. It then iterates through all possible subarrays of the input sequence, toggles the elements within those subarrays from 0 to 1 or vice versa, calculates the sum of the modified array, and keeps track of the maximum sum obtained. The function prints the maximum sum of toggled elements found during the iterations. However, the function does not handle or return specific error messages or edge cases, such as invalid inputs or exceptional situations.
