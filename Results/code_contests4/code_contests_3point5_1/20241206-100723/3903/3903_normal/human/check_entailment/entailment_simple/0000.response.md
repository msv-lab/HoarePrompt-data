Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It loops through all possible ranges of indices and flips the values accordingly, keeping track of the maximum count of ones obtained. The final output is the maximum count of ones that can be obtained after exactly one move, which is what the problem description asks for. The program considers all possible combinations of flipping indices and outputs the maximum count.
