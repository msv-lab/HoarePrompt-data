Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it correctly reads the input integers, iterates through all possible subarrays, flips the elements within those subarrays, calculates the sum of the modified array, and keeps track of the maximum sum obtained. Finally, it prints the maximum sum of toggled elements found during the iterations. The program ensures that after exactly one move, the maximum number of ones is obtained, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
