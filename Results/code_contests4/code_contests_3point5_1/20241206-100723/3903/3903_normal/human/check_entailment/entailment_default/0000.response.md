Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree that the code does not handle the case where flipping the elements in a subarray from 0 to 1 or vice versa results in a decrease in the overall count of 1s. This means that the code may not always result in the maximum number of ones as required by the problem description. For example, if the input sequence is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], the code will output 5, but the correct output should be 4 by flipping the last two elements.
