According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `start` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 3 and `end` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `start` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `end`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled elements in `a`, `start` is 4, `end` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the final updated elements of `a`, all elements in `b` have been toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, the loop has executed at least once, `end` is now equal to `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end**.
