According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `start` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `start` is 0**
