Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces. Since `map` returns a map object in Python 3, the actual values are not evaluated at this point. Therefore, the output state is: n is an input integer, `a` is a map object.
Output State: **n is an input integer, `a` is a map object**
