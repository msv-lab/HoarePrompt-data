Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object. If `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the sum of all elements `1 - b[i]` in the list `b` and the previous `maximum_count`. The loop executes a second time, `count` is the sum of all elements `1 - b[i]` in the list `b`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`.***
