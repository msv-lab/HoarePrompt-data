Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled elements in `a` after all iterations of the loop, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the final updated elements of `a` with all elements toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`. The loop has executed at least once.**
