Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled elements in `a`, `start` is 2, `end` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the final updated elements of `a`, all elements in `b` have been toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`. The loop has executed at least once and `end` is now equal to `n`. Additionally, `start` is less than or equal to `end`***
