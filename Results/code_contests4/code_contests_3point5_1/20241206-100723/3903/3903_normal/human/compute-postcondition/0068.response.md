According to the code, the loop can execute another time if `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is equal to `n`, so for the loop to execute one more time `end` should be less than `n`. Therefore, the next state should be adjusted accordingly.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the updated elements of `a`, all elements in `b` have been updated to either 0 or 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `end` is less than `n`**
