Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the updated elements of `a`, all elements in `b` have been updated to either 0 or 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`. The loop has executed at least once and `end` is now greater than or equal to `n`.***
