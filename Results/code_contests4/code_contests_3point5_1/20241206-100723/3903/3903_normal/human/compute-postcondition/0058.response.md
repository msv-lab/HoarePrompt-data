According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `end` is less than or equal to `n`. Before the loop starts, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `end` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is 2, `i` is 1, `b` is a list containing the elements of `a`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `end` is 1 less than `n`**
