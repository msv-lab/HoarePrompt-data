According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `end`, `start`, `maximum_count`, `count`, and the elements in the list `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object. For the loop to execute a second time, `end` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `a` remains a map object
- `start` should be updated based on the logic of the program
- `end` should be incremented by 1
- `maximum_count` should be updated based on the logic of the program
- `count` should be calculated based on the elements in the list `b` and updated
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `start` is updated, `end` is incremented by 1, `maximum_count` is updated, `count` is updated**
