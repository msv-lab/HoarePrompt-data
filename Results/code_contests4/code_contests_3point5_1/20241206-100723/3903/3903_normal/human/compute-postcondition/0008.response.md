Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `b` is a list containing elements of map object `a`, `i` is equal to `start`, `end` is at least 1 greater than `start`. After the execution of the code, the element at index `i` in list `b` is updated to `1 - b[i]`.**
