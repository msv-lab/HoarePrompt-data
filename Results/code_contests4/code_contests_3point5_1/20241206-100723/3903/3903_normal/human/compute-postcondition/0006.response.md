Example Answer:
The map object `a` is converted to a list and assigned to `b`. The value of `n`, `maximum_count`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. The Output State is: n is greater than 0, a is a map object, maximum_count is 0, start is 0, end is 0, and b is a list containing the elements of the map object `a`.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, a is a map object, maximum_count is 0, start is 0, end is 0, b is a list containing the elements of the map object `a`**
