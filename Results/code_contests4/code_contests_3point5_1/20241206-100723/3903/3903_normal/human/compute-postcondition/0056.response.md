According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `end` and `n`. If `end` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop starts with `end` at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `end` should be 1 and less than `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 1, `b` is a list with updated elements, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `end` should be 1 and less than `n`**
