According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `start` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is n-1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `start` should be less than `n`. Since the loop starts at 0 and increments by 1, the next value of `start` should be 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` remains 0, `start` is 1, `end` is n-1**
