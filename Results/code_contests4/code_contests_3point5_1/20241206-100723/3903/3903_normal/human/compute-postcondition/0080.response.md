Output State: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled elements in `a`, `start` is 1, `end` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the final updated elements of `a`, all elements in `b` have been toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`. The loop has executed at least once and `end` is now equal to `n`.
