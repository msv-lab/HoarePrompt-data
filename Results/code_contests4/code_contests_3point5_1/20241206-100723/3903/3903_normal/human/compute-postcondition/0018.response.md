Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the sum of all elements `1 - b[i]` in the list `b` and the previous `maximum_count`, `start` is 0, `end` is 1. The loop executes second time and `count` is the sum of all elements `1 - b[i]` in the list `b`; `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`; `b` is a list of elements in `a`.**
