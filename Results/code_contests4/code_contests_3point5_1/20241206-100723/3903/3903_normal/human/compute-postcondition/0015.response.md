Example Answer:
`maximum_count` is assigned the maximum value between `maximum_count` and `count`. The value of `count` is the sum of all elements `1 - b[i]` in the list `b`. Therefore, after execution, the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and the sum of elements `1 - b[i]` in the list `b` becomes the new `maximum_count`. 
Output State: **`count` is the sum of all elements `1 - b[i] in the list `b`; `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`**
