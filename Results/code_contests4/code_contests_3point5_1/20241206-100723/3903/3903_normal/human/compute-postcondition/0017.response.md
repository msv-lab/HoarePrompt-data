According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the sum of all elements `1 - b[i] in the list `b` and the previous `maximum_count`, `start` is 0, `end` is 1. The loop executes second time and `count` is the sum of all elements `1 - b[i] in the list `b`; `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`.**
