The element at index `i` of list `b` is updated to `1 - b[i]`, where `i` is equal to `end + 2`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 2, `b` is a list containing elements of map object `a`, and `i` is equal to `end + 2`. 
Output State: **The element at index `i` of list `b` is updated to `1 - b[i]`**
