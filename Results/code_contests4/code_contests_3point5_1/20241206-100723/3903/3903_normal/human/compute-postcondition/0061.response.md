Example Answer:
The value of `b[i]` is updated to `1 - b[i]`. The previous value of `b[i]` is unknown, but after this operation, the value of `b[i]` will be toggled between 0 and 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is `n - 1`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list containing the elements of `a`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `b[i]` is updated to either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is `n - 1`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list containing the elements of `a`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `b[i]` is updated to either 0 or 1**
