Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list containing the elements of `a`, all elements in `b` have been updated to either 0 or 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `end` is greater than the previous value of `end` but still less than `n`, `b[i]` has been toggled to 1 or 0, `end` is increased by 1.**
