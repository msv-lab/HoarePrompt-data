Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled elements in `a`, `start` is either `n+1` or `2`, `end` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the final updated elements of `a`, all elements in `b` have been toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, the loop has executed at least once, `end` is now equal to `n-1`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`.**
