Example Answer:
The `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`. The value of `maximum_count` is already updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `start` is updated to be equal to `end + 1`, `end` is incremented by 1, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `count` is equal to the number of 1's in `b`, `b` is a list containing the updated values of the map object `a` where each value is toggled, the loop does not execute.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `start` is updated to be equal to `end + 1`, `end` is incremented by 1, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `count` is equal to the number of 1's in `b`, `b` is a list containing the updated values of the map object `a` where each value is toggled, the loop does not execute**
