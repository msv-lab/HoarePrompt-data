Example Answer:
The elements of the map object `a` are converted into a list and assigned to `b`. The value of `b` is updated with the elements from `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 1, `b` is a list containing the elements of `a`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `end` should be 1 and less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is 1, `b` is a list containing the elements of `a`, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `end` should be 1 and less than `n`**
