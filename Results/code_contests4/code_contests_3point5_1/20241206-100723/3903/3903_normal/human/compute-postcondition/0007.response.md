According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`. Since `start` and `end` are both 0 initially, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution. In order for the loop to execute, `i` should be equal to `start` and `end` should be at least 1 greater than `start`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `b` is a list containing elements of map object `a`, for the loop to execute `i` is equal to `start`, `end` is at least 1 greater than `start`**.
