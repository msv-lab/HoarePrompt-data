Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the sum of all elements `1 - b[i] in the list `b` and the previous `maximum_count`, `start` is 0, `end` is 0. The loop executes first time and `count` is the sum of all elements `1 - b[i] in the list `b`; `maximum_count` is the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`.***
