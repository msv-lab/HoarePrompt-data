Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `start` is updated and less than or equal to `end`, `end` is incremented by 1, `maximum_count` is updated, `count` is updated, `b` is a list containing the updated values of the map object `a`, `i` is equal to `start + 2` for the loop to execute the second time, `b[i]` is updated to be equal to `1 - b[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than or equal to `end + 1**.
