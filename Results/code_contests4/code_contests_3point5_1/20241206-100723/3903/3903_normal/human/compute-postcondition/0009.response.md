According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `b` is a list containing elements of map object `a`, `i` is equal to `start`, and `end` is at least 1 greater than `start`. Since the loop updates the element at index `i` in list `b` to `1 - b[i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next index after the last iteration.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is at least 1, `b` is a list containing elements of map object `a`, `i` is equal to `end + 1`, `end` is at least 1 greater than `start`**
