According to the code, the loop can execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `i` is `start`, `b` is a list containing the elements of the map object `a`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 1, `end` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `i` is `start`, `b` is a list containing the elements of the map object `a`**
