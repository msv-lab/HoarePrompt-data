According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range defined by `range(0, n)` is valid. In this case, since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0 does not affect the loop execution, so it remains the same. The loop variable `end` starts at 0, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `end` is 0**
