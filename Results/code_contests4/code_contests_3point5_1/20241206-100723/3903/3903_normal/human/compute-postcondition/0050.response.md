According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `start`, and `end`. If `i` is less than or equal to `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `start + 1`, `start` is 1, `end` is 1. Since `i` is `start + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be `start + 2` which means `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is 0, `start` is 1, `end` is 1, `i` is `start + 2`, `b` is a list containing the elements of the map object `a` with the (i+1)th element updated to 1 minus its previous value**
