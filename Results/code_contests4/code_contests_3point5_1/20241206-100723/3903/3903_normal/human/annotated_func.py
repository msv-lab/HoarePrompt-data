#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an where each ai is either 0 or 1.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    maximum_count = 0
    for start in range(0, n):
        for end in range(0, n):
            if start <= end:
                b = list(a)
                for i in range(start, end + 1):
                    b[i] = 1 - b[i]
                count = sum(b)
                maximum_count = max(maximum_count, count)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a map object, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled elements in `a` after all iterations of the loop, `start` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `b` is a list containing the final updated elements of `a` with all elements toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`. The loop has executed at least once.
    print(maximum_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by a sequence of `n` integers. It then iterates through all possible subarrays of the input sequence, toggles the elements within those subarrays from 0 to 1 or vice versa, calculates the sum of the modified array, and keeps track of the maximum sum obtained. The function prints the maximum sum of toggled elements found during the iterations. However, the function does not handle or return specific error messages or edge cases, such as invalid inputs or exceptional situations.
