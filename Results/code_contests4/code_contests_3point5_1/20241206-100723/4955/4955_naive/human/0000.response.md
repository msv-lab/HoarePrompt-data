Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values A, B, and C, sorts them in descending order, calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance, and prints the result. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases where A, B, and C are integers between 1 and 9, the correctness is True.
