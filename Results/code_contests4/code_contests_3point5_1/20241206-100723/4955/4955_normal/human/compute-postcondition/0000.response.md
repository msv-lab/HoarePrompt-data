Example Answer:
`lst` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `split()` splits the input based on whitespace. Since the initial state is not provided, we can infer that `lst` will contain the input values as strings. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` contains the input values as strings.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` contains the input values as strings**
