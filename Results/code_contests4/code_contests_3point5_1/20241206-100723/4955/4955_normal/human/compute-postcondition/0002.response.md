Example Answer:
The `reverse()` method reverses the elements of the list `lst` in place. Since the initial state specifies that `lst` contains input values sorted in ascending order, after reversing the list, the values will now be in descending order. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` contains the input values sorted in descending order.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` contains the input values sorted in descending order**
