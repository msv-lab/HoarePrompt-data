Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans` to the console. The value of `ans` is calculated based on the formula `ans = A * 100 + B * 10 + C`. Given that `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers between 1 and 9 inclusive, and `lst` contains the input values sorted in descending order and converted to integers, the value of `ans` will be calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **The value of `ans` is printed to the console based on the calculation `ans = A * 100 + B * 10 + C`.**
