Example Answer:
The `lst` list is sorted in ascending order. Since the initial values of A, B, and C are not directly affected by this operation, their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` contains the input values sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` contains the input values sorted in ascending order**
