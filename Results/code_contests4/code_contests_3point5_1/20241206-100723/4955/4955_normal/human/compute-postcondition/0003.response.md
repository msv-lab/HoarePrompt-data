Example Answer:
lst is assigned the values of lst converted to integers using the map function. Since lst contains input values sorted in descending order, the values remain the same after conversion. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; lst contains the input values sorted in descending order and converted to integers.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; lst contains the input values sorted in descending order and converted to integers**
