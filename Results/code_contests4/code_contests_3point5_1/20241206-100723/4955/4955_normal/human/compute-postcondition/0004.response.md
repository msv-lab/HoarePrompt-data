Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value 10 times the first element of `lst` plus the sum of the second and third elements of `lst`. Since `lst` contains the input values sorted in descending order and converted to integers, the first element is the largest value, the second element is the second largest value, and the third element is the third largest value. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will be equal to 10 times the largest value plus the sum of the second and third largest values. 
Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9; `lst` contains the input values sorted in descending order and converted to integers; `ans` is calculated as described above.**
