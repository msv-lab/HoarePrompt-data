Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads three integers A, B, and C from input, sorts them in descending order, calculates the sum of the two largest numbers multiplied by 10 and added to the third number, and prints the result. This aligns with the requirements of the game described in the problem description. The program also ensures that the input values are between 1 and 9, satisfying the constraints specified in the problem description.
