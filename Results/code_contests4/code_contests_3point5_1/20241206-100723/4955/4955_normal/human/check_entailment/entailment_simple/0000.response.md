Correctness: **True**

The program takes three integers A, B, and C as input, representing the values on the integer panels. It then sorts these values in descending order, calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance by constructing the formula as described in the problem description (10 * lst[0] + lst[1] + lst[2]), and prints the result.

Since the program accurately follows the problem description and computes the maximum possible amount of the allowance based on the input values A, B, and C, it is correct.
