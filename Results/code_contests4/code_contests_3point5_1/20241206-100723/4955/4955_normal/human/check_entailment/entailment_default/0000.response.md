Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three integers as input, sorts them in descending order, calculates the sum of the two largest numbers multiplied by 10 and added to the third number, and then prints the result. This process exactly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code handles all valid inputs within the constraints (1 <= A, B, C <= 9) and provides the correct maximum possible amount of the allowance based on the game rules. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the function operates as intended. Therefore, the code is correct for all scenarios.
