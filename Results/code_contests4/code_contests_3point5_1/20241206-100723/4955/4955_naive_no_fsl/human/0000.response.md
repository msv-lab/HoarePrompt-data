Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values A, B, and C, sorts them in descending order, calculates the maximum allowance amount based on the formula X + Y = 10 * X + Y + Z, and then prints the result. 
For all possible input values (1 to 9), the program correctly calculates the maximum allowance amount according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
