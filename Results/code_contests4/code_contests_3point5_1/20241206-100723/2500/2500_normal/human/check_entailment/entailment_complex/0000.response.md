Correctness: **True**

The annotated program contains a function `func_1` that correctly calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between two points `(X[i], Y[i])` and `(X[j], Y[j])`. This function is essential for the main program to work correctly as it is used to calculate the time required for each piece of meat to be ready based on the heat source location.

The main program, which is not provided here but would likely utilize the `func_1` function, should be able to correctly calculate the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready by minimizing the time taken for each piece of meat. Since the function `func_1` correctly calculates the distance between points, it is likely that the main program would also be correct and fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
