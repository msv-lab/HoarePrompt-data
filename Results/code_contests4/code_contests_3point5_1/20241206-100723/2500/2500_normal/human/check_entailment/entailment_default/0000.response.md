Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not handle the case where the heat source is placed at a point that is the exact location of a piece of meat (i.e., X and Y are equal to xi and yi). This case is not accounted for in the code, which violates the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is false.
