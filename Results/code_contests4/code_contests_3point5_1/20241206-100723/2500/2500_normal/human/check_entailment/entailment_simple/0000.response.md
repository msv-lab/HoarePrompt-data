Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(i, j)` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `(X[i], Y[i])` and `(X[j], Y[j])`. This function is used to calculate the time required for a piece of meat to be ready to eat based on the heat source location.

Since the program correctly calculates the Euclidean distance between two points as described in the problem, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
