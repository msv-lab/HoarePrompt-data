The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `i` and `j`, where both `i` and `j` are integers. The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between two points `(X[i], Y[i])` and `(X[j], Y[j])`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `i` and `j`, and return the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points on the X and Y axes.
