Correctness: **False**

The given Python program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is using some custom input parsing logic which is not necessary and makes it difficult to understand. Additionally, the logic inside the while loop is quite complex and it is not clear how it is minimizing the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready.

Therefore, without a clear understanding of how the program is minimizing the time and ensuring that K or more pieces of meat are ready, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the program. As a result, the correctness of the program is considered false.
