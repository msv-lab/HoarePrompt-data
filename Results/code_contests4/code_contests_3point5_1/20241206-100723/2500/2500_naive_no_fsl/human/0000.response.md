Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem description. The logic inside the while loop is not handling all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The condition for checking if a piece of meat is ready is incorrect and does not follow the given formula.

To provide an example where the program does not work correctly, consider the following input:

```
4 3
0 0 1
3 4 1
2 2 10
1 1 1
```

The expected output for this input should be `2.0`, but the program may not produce the correct output for this case.
