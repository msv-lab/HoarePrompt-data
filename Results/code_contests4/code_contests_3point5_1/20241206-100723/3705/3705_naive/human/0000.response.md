Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of numbers with numbers from l to r as specified in the problem description. The logic implemented in the program is incorrect and does not produce the expected output for all potential cases.

For example, when l = 5 and r = 14, the expected output should be 105, but the program does not give the correct result for this input.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the example case, the program is incorrect and the correctness is **False**.
