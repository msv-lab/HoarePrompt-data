According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i`, `p`, `n`, `s`, and `f`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the previous value of `p`, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, if `i` is odd, then `f` is the minimum value between the new `p*2` and `n` plus the minimum value between the new `p` and `n`. If `i` is even, then `f` is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`i` is an integer, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the previous `p`, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, `f` is calculated based on the value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than 99**
