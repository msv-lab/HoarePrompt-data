Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `p` is 2, `n` is an integer not equal to 0, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, if `i` is odd, then `f` is the minimum value between `p*2` and `n` plus the minimum value between `p` and `n`. If `i` is even, then `f` is 0. `n` is decreased by the value of `p`.***
