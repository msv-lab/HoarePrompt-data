Output State: **`i` is an integer, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the previous `p`, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, `f` is calculated based on the value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than 99, `s` is updated by adding the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` to the previous value of `s`.**
