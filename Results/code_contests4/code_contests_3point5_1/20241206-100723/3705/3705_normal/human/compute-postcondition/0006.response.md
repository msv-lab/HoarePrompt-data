According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 100. Before the loop starts, the values of `f`, `s`, and `p` are irrelevant to the loop execution. Since the loop will execute, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `i` is 0 and `n` is not equal to 0.
State: **`f` is `0`, `s` is `0`, `p` is `1`, `i` is 0, `n` is not equal to 0 for the loop to execute**
