According to the code, the loop can execute for 100 iterations. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is odd, `f` is 0, `s` is the minimum value between `p*2` and `n`, `p` is 2, `i` is 99, `n` is not equal to 0. If `i` is even, `f` is the minimum of `p*2` and `n`, `s` is 0, `p` is 2, `i` is 98, `n` is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, if `i` is odd, `f` needs to be the minimum value between `p*2` and `n`, `s` should be 0, `p` remains 2, `i` should be 100, and `n` should be not equal to 0. If `i` is even, `f` should be 0, `s` needs to be the minimum value between `p*2` and `n`, `p` remains 2, `i` should be 99, and `n` should be not equal to 0.

State: **If `i` is odd: `f` is the minimum value between `p*2` and `n`, `s` is 0, `p` is 2, `i` is 100, `n` is not equal to 0. If `i` is even: `f` is 0, `s` is the minimum value between `p*2` and `n`, `p` is 2, `i` is 99, `n` is not equal to 0**
