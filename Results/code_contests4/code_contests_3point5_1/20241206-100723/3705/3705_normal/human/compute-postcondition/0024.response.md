Output State: **`i` is an integer, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the value of the previous `p`, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, if `i` is odd, then `f` is the minimum value between the new `p*2` and `n` plus the minimum value between the new `p` and `n`. If `i` is even, then `f` is 0.**
