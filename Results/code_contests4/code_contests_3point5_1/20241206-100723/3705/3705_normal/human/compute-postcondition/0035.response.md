The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. 
The function has two cases:
Case_1: The program returns 0.
Case_2: The program returns the sum of the squares of all the minimum values between p*2 and n where i is even, plus the sum of the squares of all the minimum values between p and n where i is odd, multiplied by the sum of s and s+1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` and return 0 in Case_1, or return the calculated sum based on the conditions mentioned in Case_2.
