Output State: **`i`, `p`, `n`, `s`, `f` are integers. If `i` is odd, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the previous `p`, `s` is updated by adding the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` to the previous value of `s`, and `f` is calculated based on the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 99. If `i` is even, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the previous `p`, `s` is updated by adding the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` to the previous value of `s`, and `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. `n` is decreased by `p`.**
