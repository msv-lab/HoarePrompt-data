Example Answer:
The value of `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. The previous value of `f` is unknown, and the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the previous `p`, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`.
Output State: **`i` is an integer, `p` is doubled, `n` is decreased by the previous `p`, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between the new `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`**
