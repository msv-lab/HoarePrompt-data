Output State: If `i` is odd: `f` is the minimum value between `p*2` and `n`, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, `p` is 2, `i` is 100, `n` is not equal to 0. If `i` is even: `f` is 0, `s` is the sum of the minimum value between `p` and `n` and the previous value of `s`, `p` is 2, `i` is 99, `n` is not equal to 0.
