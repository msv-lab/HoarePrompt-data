#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18.**
def func_1(n):
    f = 0
    s = 0
    p = 1
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is `0`, `s` is `0`, `p` is `1`. The value of `n` is not equal to 0
    for i in range(100):
        if i % 2:
            s += min(p, n)
        else:
            f += min(p, n)
        
        n -= p
        
        if n <= 0:
            break
        
        p *= 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is the sum of all the minimum values between `p*2` and `n` where `i` is even, `s` is the sum of all the minimum values between `p` and `n` where `i` is odd, `p` is the final value of `p` after all iterations, `i` is 100, `n` is less than 0.
    return f * f + s * (s + 1)
    #The program returns the sum of the squares of all the minimum values between p*2 and n where i is even, plus the sum of the squares of all the minimum values between p and n where i is odd, multiplied by the sum of s and s+1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It has two main cases: 
1. If n is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
2. If n is not 0, the function calculates the sum of the squares of the minimum values between p*2 and n for even i, and between p and n for odd i. This sum is then multiplied by the sum of s and s+1, and returned.
However, there seems to be a missing condition handling when n becomes negative during the loop execution. This potential edge case is not covered in the annotations but should be considered in the functionality description.
