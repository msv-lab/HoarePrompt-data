Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers with numbers from l to r, but it does not handle the case when n becomes negative during the loop execution. This can lead to incorrect results for certain values of l and r. The output hints also mention this potential edge case that is not covered in the code, confirming that the code is incorrect.
