Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The logic used in the program is not correct for calculating the sum of numbers between the range l and r as described in the problem statement.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
- l = 5
- r = 14

Expected Output: 105

Actual Output from the program: 5

Therefore, the program does not produce the correct output for this input case, making it incorrect.
