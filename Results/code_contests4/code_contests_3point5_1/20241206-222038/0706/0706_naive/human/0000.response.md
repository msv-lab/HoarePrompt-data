Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input, calculates the count of prime numbers in the given range, and outputs the sum of prime numbers count for each query. The program iterates through the input sequences and calculates the count of prime numbers up to the maximum number in the sequence using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Then, it processes each query by calculating the difference in the prime numbers count between the upper and lower bounds of the query range. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, and there are no cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
