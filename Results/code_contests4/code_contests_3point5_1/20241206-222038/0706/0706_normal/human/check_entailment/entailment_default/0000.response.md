Correctness: **True**

Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, it seems that the program correctly calculates the number of indexes k such that xk is divisible by a prime number in the given range [li, ri]. The code initializes certain arrays to keep track of the count of prime numbers in the input sequence and then efficiently calculates the sum of prime numbers in the given range for each query. The output hints also support the functionality of the code by explaining the steps taken to determine the count of prime numbers within the specified range.

Therefore, based on the initial assessment and the alignment between the code, description, and output hints, the correctness of the program is deemed to be **True**.
