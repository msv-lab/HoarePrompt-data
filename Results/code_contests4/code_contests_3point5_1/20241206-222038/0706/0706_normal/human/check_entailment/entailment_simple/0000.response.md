Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The provided annotated program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the given problem description. It only includes some I/O functions (func_1, func_2, func_3) but does not include any logic to calculate the sum based on the defined rules in the problem description.
2. The annotated program lacks the implementation of the required functions to calculate f(p) and find the prime numbers within the given segments li, ri.
3. As a result, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct output for the given inputs.
