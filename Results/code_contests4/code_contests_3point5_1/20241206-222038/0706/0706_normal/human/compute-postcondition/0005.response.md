According to the code, the loop executes based on the length of the list li. If the length of the list is more than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, each xi is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li is a list with a length of at least 2, ri is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of li is non-zero. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, the length of the list li must be more than 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, each xi is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li is a list with a length of at least 3, ri is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of li is non-zero**
