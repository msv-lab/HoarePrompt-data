According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of the list `li` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` is a positive integer, each `xi` is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, `m` is a positive integer, `li` is a list with a length of at least 2, `ri` is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of `li` is non-zero.
State: **n is a positive integer, each xi is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li is a list with a length of at least 2, ri is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of li is non-zero, for the loop to execute**
