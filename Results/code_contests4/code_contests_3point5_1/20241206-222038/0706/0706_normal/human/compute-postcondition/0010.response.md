Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the last element of the list `li` using `stdout.write()`. The value of `li` must have at least 2 elements, and the last element is accessed using `li[-1]`. No variables are modified in this process. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, each xi is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li is a list with a length of at least 2, ri is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of li is non-zero.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, each xi is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li is a list with a length of at least 2, ri is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of li is non-zero**
