Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `li[i]` to the standard output. Since the value of `li` is a list with a length of at least 3, and `i` is an index that is not defined in the initial state, it is not possible to determine a specific output. 
Output State: **Not enough information to determine the output state**
