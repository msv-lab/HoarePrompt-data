Example Answer:
The code snippet `stdout.write('%d ' % li[i])` prints the value of `li[i]` with a space after it. The value of `i` is not given, so the output state will depend on the actual value of `i` during execution. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, each xi is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li is a list with a length of at least 2, ri is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of li is non-zero, for the loop to execute.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, each xi is an integer such that 2 <= xi <= 10^7, m is a positive integer, li is a list with a length of at least 2, ri is an integer such that 2 <= li <= ri <= 2*10^9, and the value of li is non-zero, for the loop to execute**
