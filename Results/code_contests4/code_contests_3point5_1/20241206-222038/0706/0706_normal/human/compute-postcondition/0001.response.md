The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. The program simply reads input from stdin and returns the input after removing any trailing whitespaces. The input read from stdin is assumed to be an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^6. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_3 is to read input from stdin and return the input after removing any trailing whitespaces.
