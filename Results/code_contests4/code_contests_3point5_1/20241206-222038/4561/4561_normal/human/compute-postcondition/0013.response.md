Example Answer:
`fac` is appended with the value of `div`, so the value of `div` is added to the list `fac`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div` and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div` and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1**
