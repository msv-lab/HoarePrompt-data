According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x` is divisible by `div`, and `div` is a factor of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains the value of `div`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be divisible by `div` and `div` must be a factor of `x`.
State: **`fac` contains the value of `div` at the end, for the loop to execute again `x` must be divisible by `div` and `div` must be a factor of `x`**
