According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x` is divisible by `div`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div`. So for the loop to execute the first time, `x` must have been divisible by `div` before being updated. Additionally, `x` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div`, for the loop to execute the first time `x` was divisible by `div` before being updated, and `x` is currently greater than 1**.
