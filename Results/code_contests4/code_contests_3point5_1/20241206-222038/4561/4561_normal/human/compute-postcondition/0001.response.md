According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `fac` is an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `x` needs to be greater than 1.
State: **`fac` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is greater than 1**
