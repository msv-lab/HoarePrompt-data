Example Answer:
Since `x` is divided by `div`, the value of `x` changes accordingly. The new value of `x` will be the integer division of the previous value of `x` by the value of `div`. The value of `div` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the value of `div` at the end, `x` has been updated, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be divisible by `div` and `div` must be a factor of `x`.
Output State: **`fac` contains the value of `div` at the end, `x` has been updated, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be divisible by `div` and `div` must be a factor of `x`**
