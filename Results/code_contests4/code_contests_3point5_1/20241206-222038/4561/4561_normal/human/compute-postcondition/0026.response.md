According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x % div` is equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div`, `x` is currently greater than 1, and `div` has been appended to `fac`. For the loop to execute one more time, `div` should be a factor of the updated value of `x`. Therefore, `div` needs to be updated to a factor of the new value of `x`.
