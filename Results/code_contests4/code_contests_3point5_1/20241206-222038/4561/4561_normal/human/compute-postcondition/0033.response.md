The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5. The function will process each request of the form "+ i" or "- i" where i is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ x. After processing the request, the function returns the product of all distinct prime factors of the original value of `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x`, process each request, and return the product of all distinct prime factors of the original value of `x`.
