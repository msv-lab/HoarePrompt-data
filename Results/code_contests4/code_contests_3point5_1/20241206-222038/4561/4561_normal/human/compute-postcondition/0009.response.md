Example Answer:
`x` is updated by performing integer division with `div`, which means `x` is divided by `div` and the result is assigned back to `x`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be divisible by `div` and `div` must be a factor of `x`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` has been updated, for the loop to execute again `x` must be divisible by `div` and `div` must be a factor of `x`**
