According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `x % div == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div`, `x` is currently greater than 1, and `div` has been appended to `fac`. To execute the loop one more time, `div` should be updated to a factor of the new value of `x` that is not equal to the current value of `div`.
State: **`fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div`, `x` is currently greater than 1, `div` has been appended to `fac` and for the loop to execute again `div` should be updated to a factor of the new value of `x` that is not equal to the current value of `div`**
