According to the code, the loop can execute based on the condition that `x` is divisible by `div`. At the end of the previous iteration, `fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div`, and `x` is currently greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be divisible by `div` before being updated. Therefore, the value of `x` after the update needs to be divisible by `div`.
State: **`fac` contains the value of `div`, `x` is updated to a value where it is no longer divisible by `div`, for the loop to execute again `x` after the update is divisible by `div` and `x` is currently greater than 1**
