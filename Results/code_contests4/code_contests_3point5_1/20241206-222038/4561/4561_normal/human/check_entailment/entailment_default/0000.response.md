Based on the problem description and the code provided, let's make an initial assessment:

The program seems to be designed to handle requests to activate or deactivate colliders based on the condition that the activated colliders must have pairwise relatively prime numbers to each other. The program processes the requests in the order they are received and provides the appropriate responses as described in the problem statement.

Now, let's analyze if the output hints agree with the code:

- The output hints describe the process of handling requests to activate or deactivate colliders, including checking for conflicts with already activated colliders based on their prime factors.
- The output hints specify the expected responses for each type of request (+ i or - i) and outline the conditions for each response.

Given the initial assessment and the agreement between the code and the output hints, it seems that the program is correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided output hints.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly processes the requests to activate or deactivate colliders based on the given conditions. It handles conflicts with already activated colliders by checking the prime factors of the colliders involved. The responses provided by the program align with the expected outcomes as described in the problem statement. Since there are no identified cases where the program does not work as expected, the code can be considered correct.
