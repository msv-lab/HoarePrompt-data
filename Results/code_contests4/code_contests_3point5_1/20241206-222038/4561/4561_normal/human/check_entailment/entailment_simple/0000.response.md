Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly implement the problem description. The `func_1` function initializes a list `prim` where each index corresponds to a collider number and stores the smallest prime factor of that number. This is crucial for determining if two colliders have relatively prime numbers. The `func_2` function then factors a given number `x` into its prime factors using the list `prim`, which is necessary for checking if two collider numbers are relatively prime.

Overall, the program seems to correctly handle the requests for activating and deactivating colliders while ensuring that activated colliders have pairwise relatively prime numbers.
