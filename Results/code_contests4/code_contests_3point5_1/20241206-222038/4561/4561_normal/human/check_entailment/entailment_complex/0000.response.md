Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when the value of `x` in `func_2` is less than or equal to 1. According to the problem description, the input value `x` should be a natural number between 1 and `n`, but the code does not check for this condition. This means that the code does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
