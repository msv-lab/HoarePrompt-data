The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` and calculates the product of all distinct prime factors of the original value of `x`. The function processes each request in the form of "+ i" or "- i" where i is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ x. After processing the requests, it returns the product of prime factors. However, the function lacks handling of the case when x is less than or equal to 1, and it does not consider negative values of x.
