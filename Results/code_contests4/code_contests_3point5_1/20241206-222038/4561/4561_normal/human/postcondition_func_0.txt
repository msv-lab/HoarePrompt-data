The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and initializes a list `prim` where the value at index 1 is set to 1. It then iterates through a range of numbers from 2 to `n-1` checking if the value at that index in the `prim` list is false. If false, it assigns the current index to all multiples of that index up to `n`. The function processes requests in the form of "+ i" or "- i" where i is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function does not have a specific return value.
