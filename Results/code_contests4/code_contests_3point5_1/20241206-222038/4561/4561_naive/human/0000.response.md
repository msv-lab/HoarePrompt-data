Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to handle requests of activating and deactivating colliders based on whether the numbers are pairwise relatively prime or not. The program processes the requests in the order they are received and prints the appropriate response for each request as per the problem description. The program also handles cases where colliders are already on or off, conflicts with other colliders, and ensures that colliders are activated or deactivated accordingly. The program uses functions to calculate prime numbers and factors efficiently and stores the state of colliders in memory to check for conflicts. Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the expected output for the provided input.
