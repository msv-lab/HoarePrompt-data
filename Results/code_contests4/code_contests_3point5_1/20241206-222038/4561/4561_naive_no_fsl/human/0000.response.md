Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It maintains a set of activated colliders for each prime factor of the collider number to ensure that only colliders with relatively prime numbers are activated simultaneously. The program handles both activation and deactivation requests according to the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The program processes the requests in the order they are received and produces the expected output for each request. The program correctly checks for conflicts when trying to activate a collider and handles the cases where colliders are already activated or deactivated appropriately. 

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases that could arise during the activation and deactivation of colliders.
