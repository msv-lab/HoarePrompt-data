You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Enter a positive integer n of 4,000 or less, with a pair of integers a, b, c, d in the range 0-1000.


a + b + c + d = n


Create a program that outputs the number of combinations that satisfy the conditions.



Input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is given n on one row. Please process until the end of the input.

The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

Output

For each data set, output the number of combinations of a, b, c, and d on one line.

Example

Input

2
3
35


Output

10

8436
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 4,000. a, b, c, and d are integers in the range 0-1000 such that a + b + c + d = n.
def func_1():
    ans = [0] * 4001
    for line in stdin:
        n = int(line)
        
        if not ans[n]:
            count = 0
            for a in xrange((n if n < 1000 else 1000) + 1):
                e1 = n - a - 1001 if n - a - 1001 >= 0 else -1
                for nab in xrange(n - a, e1, -1):
                    ran = (nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000
                         else -1)
                    if ran >= 0:
                        count += ran
            ans[n] = count
        
        print(ans[n])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, `a + b + c + d = n`, `ans` is a list of 4001 elements filled with the sum of valid `ran` values for each index in the list.
    exit()

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
