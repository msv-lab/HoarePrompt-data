Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. It reads input from stdin, calculates the sum of `ran` values for each index in the `ans` list based on the constraints provided, and prints the calculated sum. The code correctly calculates the number of combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that satisfy the condition `a + b + c + d = n`. The code handles multiple datasets and processes them until the end of the input. The logic inside the `func_1` function seems to be correct and provides the expected output for the given problem description. Since there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem description, and the code seems to cover all possible cases, the correctness of the code is determined to be True.
