Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the number of combinations that satisfy the conditions described in the problem. It initializes a list `ans` with 4001 elements, each representing the number of combinations for a specific `n`. It then iterates through the input values of `n`, calculating the number of valid combinations based on the constraints given in the problem description.

The program uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `a` and `nab`, ensuring that the sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` is equal to `n`. It accurately counts the valid combinations and stores them in the `ans` list.

Therefore, the program is correct and outputs the expected number of combinations for each dataset provided in the input.
