Example Answer:
`count` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value parsed from the input `line`, `ans[n]` is set to the value of `count`, `n` is less than 1000, `e1` is correctly calculated, `nab` is adjusted, `ran` is a non-negative integer, `a` is incremented, and `e1` is updated accordingly, `count` is 0**
