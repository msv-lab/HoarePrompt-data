Example Answer:
The list `ans` is initialized with 4001 elements, all set to 0. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 4,000, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers in the range 0-1000 such that `a + b + c + d = n`, `ans` is a list of 4001 elements initialized with 0**
