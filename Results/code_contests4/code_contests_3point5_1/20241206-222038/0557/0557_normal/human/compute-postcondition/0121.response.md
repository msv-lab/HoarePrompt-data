Postcondition: ***`count`, `a`, `n` are integers. `count` is 0, `a` is 0, `n` is less than 1000. `e1` is calculated based on a given formula, `ran` is calculated based on a given formula. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is increased by the value of `ran`, where both `count` and `ran` are greater than or equal to 0.***
