Postcondition: ***`count`, `a`, `n`, `e1`, `ran`, `nab` are integers. If ran >= 0, `count` is increased by the calculated value of the new `ran`, `a` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `e1` is recalculated, `ran` is the calculated value based on the decremented value of the new `nab`, `nab` is decremented by 1.***
