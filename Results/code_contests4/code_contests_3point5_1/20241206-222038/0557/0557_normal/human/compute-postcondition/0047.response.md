Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, `ans[n]` remains False, `count` is the updated sum of all valid `ran` values, `n` is less than 1000, `e1` is calculated correctly, `nab` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration, `ran` is a non-negative integer, `a` is incremented by 1, `e1` is the result of the calculation n - a - 1001 if n - a - 1001 >= 0, otherwise -1, `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, and `count` is the updated sum of all valid `ran` values.***
