Example Answer:
The value of `ran` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned. If `nab` is less than 1000, `ran` is `(nab - 1001) - (nab - 1)` which simplifies to `-1000`. If `nab` is greater than 1000, `ran` is `(1000) - (1000 - 1)` which simplifies to `1`. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the previous values of the variables involved.
Output State: **Dependent on the previous values of the variables involved**
