Postcondition: ***`count`, `a`, `n`, `e1`, `ran`, `nab` are all integers. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is updated, `a` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `e1` is recalculated based on `n` and `a`, `ran` is recalculated, `nab` starts from n - a, ends at e1, and decrements by 1 each iteration.***
