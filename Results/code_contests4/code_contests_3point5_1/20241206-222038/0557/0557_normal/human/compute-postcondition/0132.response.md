Example Answer:
The value of `e1` is calculated based on the values of `n` and `a`. If `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0, then `e1` is assigned that value, otherwise, it is assigned -1. The values of `count`, `a`, and `ran` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is updated, `a` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `e1` is recalculated based on `n` and `a`, `ran` is recalculated.
Output State: **`count` is updated, `a` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `e1` is recalculated based on `n` and `a`, `ran` is recalculated**
