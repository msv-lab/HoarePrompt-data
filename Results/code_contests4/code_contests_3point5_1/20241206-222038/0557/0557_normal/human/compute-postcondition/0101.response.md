Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`. The previous values of `count` and `ran` are unknown, so the updated state after execution is: `n`, `ans`, `e1`, `nab - 1`, `new_ran`, `a + 1`, `count +/- new_ran`, `ran` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above, `count` is increased by an unknown value.
Output State: **`n`, `ans`, `e1`, `nab - 1`, `new_ran`, `a + 1`, `count +/- new_ran`, `ran` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above, `count` is increased by an unknown value**
