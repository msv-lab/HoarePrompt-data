Postcondition: ***`count`, `a` are integers. If `ran` >= 0, `count` is increased by the calculated value of `ran`, `a` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `e1` is recalculated, `ran` is the calculated value based on the decremented value of `nab`, `nab` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
