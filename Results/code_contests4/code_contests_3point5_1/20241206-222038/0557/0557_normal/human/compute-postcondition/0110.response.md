Postcondition: ***`n`, `ans`, `e1`, `nab`, `ran`, `a`, `count` are all integers with specified constraints. After the if part executes, the value of `count` will be the sum of all non-negative values of `ran` calculated during each iteration of the loop. The final values of `n`, `ans`, `e1`, `nab`, `ran`, and `a` will be determined based on the loop conditions and calculations in each iteration. If the loop does not execute at all, the values of `count` and other variables will remain unchanged.***
