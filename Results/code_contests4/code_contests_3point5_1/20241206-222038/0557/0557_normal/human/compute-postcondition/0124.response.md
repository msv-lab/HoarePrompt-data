Example Answer:
`count` is increased by the value of `ran`. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the new value of `count` is `count + ran`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by the value of `ran`, `nab` is within the range of `e1` and `n-a-1`, iterator decreases by 1.
Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `ran`, `nab` is within the range of `e1` and `n-a-1`, iterator decreases by 1**
