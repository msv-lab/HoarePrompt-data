Postcondition: ***`n`, `ans`, `e1`, `nab`, `ran`, `a + 1`, `count` are all integers with specified constraints. For the loop to execute, `n - a` is less than or equal to `e1`. `ran` is assigned the value of `(nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)`. Additionally, `ran` is greater than or equal to 0 and `count` is incremented by the calculated `ran`.***
