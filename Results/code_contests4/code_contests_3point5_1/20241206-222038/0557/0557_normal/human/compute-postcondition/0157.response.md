Postcondition: ***`count`, `a`, `n`, `e1`, and `nab` remain the same. `ran` is recalculated based on the decremented value of `nab`. For the loop to execute a second time, `n - a` must be greater than or equal to `e1`. `nab` is equal to `n - a`. `a` is increased by 1. `ran` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet, and `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
