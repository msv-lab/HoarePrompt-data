Example Answer:
`count` is increased by the value of `ran`. The previous values of `count` and `ran` are unknown, so the exact value of `count` after execution is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by the value of `ran`, other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `ran`, other variables remain unchanged**
