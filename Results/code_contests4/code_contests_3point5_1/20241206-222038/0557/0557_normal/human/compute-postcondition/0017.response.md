Output State: **`n`, `ran`, `ans`, `count`, `e1`, `nab` are integers. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, then `n` is an integer value parsed from the input `line`, `ans[n]` is False, `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`, `n` is less than 1000, `e1` is calculated correctly based on the formula provided, `nab` is adjusted to be within the range of `n - a` to `e1`, and `nab` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time. `ran` is calculated based on the formula provided.**
