Example Answer:
The value of `e1` is calculated by subtracting `a` and 1001 from `n`. If the result is greater than or equal to 0, `e1` is assigned that value, otherwise, `e1` is assigned -1. The values of `n`, `ans`, `nab`, `ran`, `a + 1`, and `count` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `ans`, `e1`, `nab`, `ran`, `a + 1`, `count` are all integers with specified constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `ans`, `e1`, `nab`, `ran`, `a + 1`, `count` are all integers with specified constraints**
