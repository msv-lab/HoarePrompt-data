Example Answer:
`ans[n]` is printed, but it is not mentioned what value `ans[n]` holds. Therefore, the Output State is: `count`, `a`, `n`, `e1`, `ran`, `nab` are integers. If `ans[n]` is False, `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`.
Output State: **`count`, `a`, `n`, `e1`, `ran`, `nab` are integers. If `ans[n]` is False, `ans[n]` is assigned the value of `count`**
