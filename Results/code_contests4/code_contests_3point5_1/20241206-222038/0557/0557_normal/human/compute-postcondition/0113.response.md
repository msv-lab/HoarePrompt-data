Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(line)`, where `line` is converted to an integer. No changes were made to the initial state variables for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes need to be made to the initial state variables for the loop to execute one more time, `n` is an integer.
Output State: **No changes need to be made to the initial state variables for the loop to execute one more time, `n` is an integer**
