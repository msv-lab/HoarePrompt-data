According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is less than 1000, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans[n]` is False and `count` is 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` has to be less than 1000, `ans[n]` needs to be False, and `count` should be 0.
State: **`n` is an integer value parsed from the input `line`, `ans[n]` is False, `count` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is less than 1000**
