Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value parsed from the input `line`. After the execution of the if block, `ans[n]` is set to the value of `count`, where `count` is the sum of all valid `ran` values calculated during the loop iterations. The values of `n`, `e1`, `nab`, `ran`, and `a` are adjusted according to the described conditions. `n` is less than 1000, `e1` is correctly calculated based on the final `n` and `a` values, `nab` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition for the last iteration, `ran` is a non-negative integer, `a` is incremented by the total number of iterations, and `e1` is the result of the calculation `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001 >= 0`, otherwise -1.***
