Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value parsed from the input `line`. The value of `line` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value parsed from the input `line`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value parsed from the input `line`**
