**Precondition:**

- The input consists of multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes:
  - Two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
  - n integers representing the weights of the fridges, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each i.
- The goal is to create exactly m steel chains to make all fridges private.
- A fridge is private if only the owner can open it.
- The cost of creating a steel chain connecting fridges u and v is a_u + a_v dollars.
- The landlord wants to minimize the total cost of all steel chains.
- If there is no solution, output -1. Otherwise, output the minimum total cost and the connections for each steel chain.
