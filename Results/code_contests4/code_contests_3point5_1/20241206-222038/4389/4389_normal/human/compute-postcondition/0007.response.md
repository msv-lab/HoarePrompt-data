According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `k`. Since the condition (m >= n and n != 2) is satisfied, the loop will execute as long as n is not equal to 2. Before the loop starts, n and m have been extracted from the last element of list `le`, and `af` has been calculated based on list `a`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` should be greater than or equal to 0, `m` should be greater than or equal to `n`, `n` should not be equal to 2, `af` should be calculated correctly, and `k` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `m` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
