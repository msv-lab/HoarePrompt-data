Example Answer: 
`af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`, and now it will also contain the string representation of `k + 1` concatenated with a space and the result of `(k + 1) % n + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`, and in each iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1. Since `n` is not equal to 2, the loop will start with `k` being equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `m` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a` and the new appended string, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `m` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a` and the new appended string, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is equal to `n`**
