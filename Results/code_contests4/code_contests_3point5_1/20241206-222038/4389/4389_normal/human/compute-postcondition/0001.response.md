Example Answer:
The last element of the list `le` is extracted and split into integers, which are then stored in list `a`. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the first and second elements of list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values extracted from the last element of list `le`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values extracted from the last element of list `le`**
