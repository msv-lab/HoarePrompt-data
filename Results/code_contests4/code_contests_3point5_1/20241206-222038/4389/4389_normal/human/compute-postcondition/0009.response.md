According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is extracted from the last element of list `le`, `m` is extracted from the last element of list `le`, `af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1 and it should be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `m` is an integer extracted from the last element of list `le`, `af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is `n`, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` should be less than `n`.**
