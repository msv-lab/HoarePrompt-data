Example Answer: 
`n` and `m` are assigned the values from converting the elements of the last element in the list `le` to integers using `map` and `split`. The previous values of `n` and `m` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values extracted from the last element of the list `le`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values extracted from the last element of the list `le`**
