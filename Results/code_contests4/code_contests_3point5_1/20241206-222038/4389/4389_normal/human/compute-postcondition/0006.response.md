Example Answer:
The list `af` appends the value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`. The condition (m >= n and n != 2) is satisfied, so the code runs. The values of `n` and `m` are extracted from the last element of list `le`, and `af` appends the calculated value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values extracted from the last element of list `le`. The condition (m >= n and n != 2) is satisfied; `af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values extracted from the last element of list `le`. The condition (m >= n and n != 2) is satisfied; `af` contains the appended value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`**
