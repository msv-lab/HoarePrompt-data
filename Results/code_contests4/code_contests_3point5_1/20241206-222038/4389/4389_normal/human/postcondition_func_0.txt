The function func_1 extracts integer values for n and m from the last element of list `le`, then appends -1 to the list `af` if either m is less than n or n is equal to 2. If neither condition is met, the function calculates 2 times the sum of elements in list `a` and appends it to `af`. Additionally, the function appends strings representing pairs of numbers from 1 to n in `af`.
