Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully comply with the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the cost of the steel chains and connects all fridges in a circular manner. However, the requirement is to create exactly `m` steel chains to ensure that all fridges are private, meaning that each fridge can only be opened by its owner. This requirement is not met by the code as it does not consider the ownership constraints when creating the steel chains. Additionally, the function appends the circular connections to the output without ensuring that all fridges are private. Therefore, the code does not fully address the problem description.

The output hints correctly describe the function `func_1` and its logic. However, the hints do not provide any example or edge case that is not handled by the code. This suggests that the hints are consistent with the code, but the code itself does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
