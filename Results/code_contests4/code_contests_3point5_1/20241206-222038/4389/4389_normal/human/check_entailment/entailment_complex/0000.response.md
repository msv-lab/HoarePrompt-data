Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It first checks if there is no solution based on the conditions provided in the problem description and appends -1 to the output list if necessary. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum total cost as 2 times the sum of the weights of all fridges. It then creates connections between fridges in a way that ensures each fridge is private and appends these connections to the output list.

The program always follows the problem description as it handles the cases where there is no solution by outputting -1 and provides a solution that minimizes the total cost by creating connections between fridges as required.
