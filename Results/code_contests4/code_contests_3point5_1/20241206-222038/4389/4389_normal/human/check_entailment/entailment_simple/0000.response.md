Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether there exists a solution to make exactly m steel chains to secure all fridges in the apartment. It follows the problem description by checking if m is less than n or n is equal to 2 and appending -1 to the output list if the criteria are not met. 

If a solution exists, it calculates the minimum total cost by summing twice the weights of all fridges. It then connects each fridge to the next one in a circular manner, ensuring that only the owner can open each fridge. This satisfies the requirement of making all fridges private.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
