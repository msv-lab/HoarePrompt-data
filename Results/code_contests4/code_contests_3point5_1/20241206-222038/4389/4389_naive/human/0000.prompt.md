You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hanh lives in a shared apartment. There are n people (including Hanh) living there, each has a private fridge. 

n fridges are secured by several steel chains. Each steel chain connects two different fridges and is protected by a digital lock. The owner of a fridge knows passcodes of all chains connected to it. A fridge can be open only if all chains connected to it are unlocked. For example, if a fridge has no chains connected to it at all, then any of n people can open it.

<image> For exampe, in the picture there are n=4 people and 5 chains. The first person knows passcodes of two chains: 1-4 and 1-2. The fridge 1 can be open by its owner (the person 1), also two people 2 and 4 (acting together) can open it.

The weights of these fridges are a_1, a_2, …, a_n. To make a steel chain connecting fridges u and v, you have to pay a_u + a_v dollars. Note that the landlord allows you to create multiple chains connecting the same pair of fridges. 

Hanh's apartment landlord asks you to create exactly m steel chains so that all fridges are private. A fridge is private if and only if, among n people living in the apartment, only the owner can open it (i.e. no other person acting alone can do it). In other words, the fridge i is not private if there exists the person j (i ≠ j) that the person j can open the fridge i.

For example, in the picture all the fridges are private. On the other hand, if there are n=2 fridges and only one chain (which connects them) then both fridges are not private (both fridges can be open not only by its owner but also by another person).

Of course, the landlord wants to minimize the total cost of all steel chains to fulfill his request. Determine whether there exists any way to make exactly m chains, and if yes, output any solution that minimizes the total cost. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10). Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ n) — the number of people living in Hanh's apartment and the number of steel chains that the landlord requires, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) — weights of all fridges.

Output

For each test case:

  * If there is no solution, print a single integer -1. 
  * Otherwise, print a single integer c — the minimum total cost. The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), meaning that the i-th steel chain connects fridges u_i and v_i. An arbitrary number of chains can be between a pair of fridges. 



If there are multiple answers, print any.

    if m < n or n == 2:

        return None
    af.append(2 * sum(a))

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
