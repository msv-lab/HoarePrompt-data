Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all the test cases correctly. It fails when the number of required steel chains is less than the number of people living in the apartment or when there are only 2 people living in the apartment. In those cases, the program should output -1, but it does not do so. Instead, it calculates the minimum total cost incorrectly. 

For example, if we input:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
The correct output should be -1, but the program outputs 2, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the problem description for all potential cases.
