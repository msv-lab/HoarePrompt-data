Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the given problem description. It calculates the number of distinct good plans based on the constraints provided, uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of good plans within the bug limit, and outputs the answer modulo the given integer. The program iterates through all possible combinations of lines written by each programmer and efficiently computes the number of distinct good plans. The logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
