Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of distinct good plans as required by the problem description. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of bugs per line written by each programmer and ensures that the total number of bugs does not exceed the given limit. The program iterates through all possible combinations of lines and bugs to determine the final answer. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases.
