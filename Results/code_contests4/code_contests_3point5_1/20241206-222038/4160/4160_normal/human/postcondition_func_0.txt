The function `func` defines lambda functions for addition, multiplication, and reading integers from input. It then reads values for `n`, `m`, `b`, and `mod` from input. It initializes arrays `a` and `mem` based on the input values. The function then performs calculations using nested loops to update `mem`. The final result is computed and printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
