Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using dynamic programming to calculate the number of distinct good plans. It iterates through each programmer and each line of code, updating the `mem` array based on the bugs per line for each programmer. Finally, it calculates the total number of distinct good plans by summing up the values in the `mem` array for the last programmer and the total number of bugs within the specified limit.

The program handles all possible cases for the input values of `n`, `m`, `b`, `mod`, and `a`, ensuring that it calculates the correct number of distinct good plans modulo `mod` as required by the problem description.
