Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the stated problem description. The main issue lies in the logic of updating the `mem` array within the nested loops. The program does not correctly update the `mem` array based on the constraints provided in the problem description.

Additionally, the program lacks proper comments and explanations within the code, making it difficult to understand the logic and reasoning behind the implementation. This can lead to potential errors and inaccuracies in the final result.

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for, and it is not a correct solution to the stated problem.
