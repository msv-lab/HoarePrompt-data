Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It takes input values for the number of programmers, lines of code, maximum total number of bugs, and the modulo value. It then initializes arrays based on the input values and performs calculations using nested loops to update the array `mem`. Finally, it computes the final result and prints it. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the number of bugs in each line of code does not exceed the given limit. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code fails to handle. Hence, the code is correct.
