According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values, `ix` is 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` and `k` are adjusted based on loop conditions, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` contains the values after the next iteration**
