According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `i` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the final updated values in `mem[ix][j+1][a[n]]` to `mem[ix][j+1][b]` will contain the final updated values after all iterations of the loop. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `b` should be increased by 1.
State: **The final updated values in `mem[ix][j+1][a[n]]` to `mem[ix][j+1][b+1]` will contain the final updated values after all iterations of the loop**
