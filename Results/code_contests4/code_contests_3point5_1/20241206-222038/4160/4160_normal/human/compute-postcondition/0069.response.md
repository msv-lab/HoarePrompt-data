Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the previous value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it. This operation is performed for all iterations of the loop when `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `i` is valid. The final value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is determined by the calculations based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`.
Output State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop where conditions are met.**
