Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` is the XOR operation. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the new value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is based on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: for the loop to execute, `a[i - 1]` must be less than or equal to `b`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is dependent on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **for the loop to execute, `a[i - 1]` must be less than or equal to `b`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is dependent on the previous value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]**
