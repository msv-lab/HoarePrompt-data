According to the code, the loop will execute if `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values, `ix` is 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is such that `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is adjusted based on loop conditions, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` contains the values after the next iteration**
