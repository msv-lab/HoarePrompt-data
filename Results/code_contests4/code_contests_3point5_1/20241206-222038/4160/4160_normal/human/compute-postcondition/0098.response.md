According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `a`, `b`, `ix`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `mem`. At the end of the last iteration, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `i` is 1, `ix` is updated, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k + 1`, `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[0]]` are updated, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated. 

To execute the loop one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- `ix` should be updated
- `j` should be incremented by 1
- `k` should be updated to `k + 1`
- `mem[ix][j][k]` should be updated
- `mem[ix][j][k]` should be assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]
- `mem[ix][j][k]` should be added to `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`

State: **`a[i]` is less than or equal to `b`, `i` is 2, `ix` is updated again, `m` is still greater than or equal to 1, `j` is further incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[1]]` are updated, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k], `mem[ix][j][k]` is added to `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]**
