Example Answer:
`n, m, b, mod` are assigned the values returned by `rints()`. Since the `rints()` function reads integers from input, the values of `n, m, b, mod` are determined by the input provided. The modulo value `mod` is also assigned based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, b, mod` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`n, m, b, mod` are assigned values based on user input**
