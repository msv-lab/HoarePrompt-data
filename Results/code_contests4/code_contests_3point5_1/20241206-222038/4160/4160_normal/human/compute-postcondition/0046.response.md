Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` determine the specific values used in the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]`, `a[i - 1] <= b` remain unchanged; `j` is incremented to `j + 1`; `ix` is updated to the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `j` is 1, and `ix` is the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the mentioned assignment.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]`, `a[i - 1] <= b` remain unchanged; `j` is incremented to `j + 1`; `ix` is updated to the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `j` is 1, and `ix` is the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the mentioned assignment**
