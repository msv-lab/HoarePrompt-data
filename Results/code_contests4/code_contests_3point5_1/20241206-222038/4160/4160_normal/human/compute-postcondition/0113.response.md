Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` will contain the final updated values based on the calculations performed within the loop. The values of `i`, `ix`, `m`, `j`, and `k` will be determined by the loop conditions and the number of iterations. The loop will update `mem[ix][j+1][k]` for all values of `k` in the range from `a[i]` to `b` for each value of `j` in the range from 1 to `m`.**
