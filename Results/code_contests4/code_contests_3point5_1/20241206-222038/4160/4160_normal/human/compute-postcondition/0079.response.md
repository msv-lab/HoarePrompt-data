Output State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i]]` for all iterations of the loop. The loop updates `mem[ix][j+1][k]` for all values of `k` in the range from `a[i]` to `b` for each value of `j` in the range from 1 to `m`, `i` is incremented by 1. `ix` is assigned the value of `i & 1`.**
