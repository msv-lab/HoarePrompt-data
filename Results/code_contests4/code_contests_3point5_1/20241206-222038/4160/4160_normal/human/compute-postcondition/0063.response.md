Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is greater than its current value and less than or equal to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be within the specified range.
Output State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than the current value and less than or equal to `b`**
