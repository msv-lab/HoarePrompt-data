Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than the current value and less than or equal to `b`. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the result of adding `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. 
Output State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than the current value and less than or equal to `b`.**
