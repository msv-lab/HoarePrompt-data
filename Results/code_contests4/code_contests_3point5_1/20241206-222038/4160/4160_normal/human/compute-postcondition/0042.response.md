According to the code, the loop can execute until `j + 1` is greater than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `a[i - 1] <= b` for one more loop execution. `n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged. `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final values after all iterations of the loop have finished. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition `j + 1 <= b` should still hold true.
State: **`n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged; `mem[ix][j+1][k]` contains the values after the next iteration; `a[i - 1] <= b` still holds true for one more loop execution; `j` is incremented to `j + 1`**
