According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. For the next iteration, `j` will increase by 1. 
State: **`n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the loop execution for all iterations**
