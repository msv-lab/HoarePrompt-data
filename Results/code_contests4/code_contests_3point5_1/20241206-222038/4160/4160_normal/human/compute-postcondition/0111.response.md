Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i]` is updated to the next value, `j` is further incremented by `i + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to the next value, `j` is further incremented by `i + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
