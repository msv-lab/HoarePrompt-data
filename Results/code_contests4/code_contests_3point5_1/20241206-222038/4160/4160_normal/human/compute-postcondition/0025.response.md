Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values, `ix` is 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is such that `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is such that `k + 1` is within the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the addition, `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` contains the values after the next iteration**
