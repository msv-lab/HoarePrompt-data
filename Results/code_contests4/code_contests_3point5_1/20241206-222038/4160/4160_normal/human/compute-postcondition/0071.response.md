Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` are used to update `mem[ix][j][k]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k+1]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k+1 - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop where conditions are met.
Output State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k+1]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k+1 - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop where conditions are met.**
