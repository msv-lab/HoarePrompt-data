Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i]` is updated to the next value, `j` is further incremented by `i + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to the next value, `j` is further incremented by `i + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1**
