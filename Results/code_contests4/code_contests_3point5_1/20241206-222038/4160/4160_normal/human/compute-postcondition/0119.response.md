According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the final updated values in `mem[ix][j+1][a[n]]` to `mem[ix][j+1][b+1]` will contain the final updated values. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **The final updated values in `mem[ix][j+1][a[n]]` to `mem[ix][j+1][b+1]` will contain the final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`**
