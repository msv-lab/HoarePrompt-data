According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and the condition `a[i - 1] <= b`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration and `a[i - 1] <= b` for one more loop execution, the loop can execute again if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `b`. Additionally, the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the given condition.
State: **Values of `n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated; `a[i - 1] <= b` still holds true for one more loop execution; `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; for the loop to execute one more time `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `b**`
