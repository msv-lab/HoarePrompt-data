Output State: **`n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged; `mem[ix][j][k]` contains the final values after all iterations of the loop have finished; `a[i - 1] <= b` for one more loop execution; `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until `j + 1` is greater than `b`, at which point the loop will terminate.**
