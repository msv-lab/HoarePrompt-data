Output State: `n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the calculation `add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`; `a[i - 1] <= b` still holds true for one more loop execution; `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; for the loop to execute one more time `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `b.
