Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value in `mem[n & 1][m][i]` using the `add` function. The value of `n` is used as an index in the `mem` array, `m` is used as another index, and `i` is incremented by 1. The final updated values in `mem[ix][j+1][a[n]]` to `mem[ix][j+1][b+1]` are not explicitly mentioned, so we cannot determine their values. Therefore, the Output State is: The final updated values in `mem[ix][j+1][a[n]]` to `mem[ix][j+1][b+1]` are not explicitly determined, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.
Output State: **The final updated values in `mem[ix][j+1][a[n]]` to `mem[ix][j+1][b+1]` are not explicitly determined, `i` is incremented to `i + 1**.
