Output State: The final values of mem[ix][j+1][k] have been updated based on the previous values of mem[ix ^ 1][j][k] and the addition of mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[0]] for all iterations of the loop, i is 1, ix is assigned the value of i & 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, j is 2, k is in the range from a[i - 1] to b, and mem[ix][j][k] is updated based on the addition of mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]] and mem[ix][j][k].
