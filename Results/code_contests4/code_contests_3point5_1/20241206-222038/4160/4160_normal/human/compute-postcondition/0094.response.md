Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The previous values of the affected variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b, `i` is 1, `ix` is updated to the new value of `i & 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is set to `a[i - 1]`, `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[0]]` are updated, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b, `i` is 1, `ix` is updated, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated, `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[0]]` are updated, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated**
