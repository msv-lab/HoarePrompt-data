According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and the values stored in `a`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]`. The loop will execute if `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`. 

State: **for the loop to execute, `a[i - 1]` must be less than or equal to `b`**
