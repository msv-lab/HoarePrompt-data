According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and the values of `mem[ix][j][k]`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time the value of `k` must be greater than the current value and less than or equal to `b`**
