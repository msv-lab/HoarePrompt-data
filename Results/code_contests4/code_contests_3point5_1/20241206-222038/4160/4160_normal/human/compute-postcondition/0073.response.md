According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, the final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k+1]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k+1 - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop where conditions are met. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k+1]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k+1 - a[i]]` for all iterations of the loop where conditions are met, `k` is increased by 1**
