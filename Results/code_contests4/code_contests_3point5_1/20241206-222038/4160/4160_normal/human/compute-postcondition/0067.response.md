According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `i`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` and `i` is valid, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `mem[ix][j+1][k]` is updated accordingly.
State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `i` is valid**
