Output State: **`a[i]` is less than or equal to `b`, `i` is the total number of iterations, `ix` is the final updated value, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by `i`, `k` is updated to `b + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by `i` again and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1, `a[i-1]` is updated to the next value for the next iteration of the loop.**
