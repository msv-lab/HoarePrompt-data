According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and the updated value of `mem[ix][j][k]`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions `a[i - 1] <= b` and `j` being incremented by 1 must be satisfied for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute again:
State: **Values of `n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged; `mem[ix][j+1][k]` is updated; `a[i - 1] <= b` for one more loop execution; `j` is incremented by 1**
