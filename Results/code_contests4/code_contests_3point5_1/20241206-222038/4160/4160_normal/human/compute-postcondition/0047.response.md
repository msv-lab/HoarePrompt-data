Output State: **`n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]`, `a[i - 1] <= b` remain unchanged; `j` is incremented to `j + 1`; `ix` is updated to the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1; for the loop to execute the first time `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `j` is 1, and `ix` is the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the assignment `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`**
