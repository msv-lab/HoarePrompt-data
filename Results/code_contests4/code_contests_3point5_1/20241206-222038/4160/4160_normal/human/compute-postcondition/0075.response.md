Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k+1]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k+1 - a[i]]` for all iterations of the loop where conditions are met. The value of `k` is increased by 1 after each iteration. 
Output State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k+1]` have been updated, `k` is increased by 1**
