According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k`, `b`, `a[i - 1]`, `j`, `ix`, and `mem[ix][j][k]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `k`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]`, `a[i - 1] <= b` remain unchanged; `j` is incremented to `j + 1`; `ix` is updated to the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1; for the loop to execute the next time `k` must still be less than or equal to `b`, `j` is increased by 1, and `ix` is the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1. Additionally, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the assignment `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`.
State: **`n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `k`, `j`, `ix`, `mem[ix][j][k]` are updated for the next iteration based on the conditions mentioned above.**
