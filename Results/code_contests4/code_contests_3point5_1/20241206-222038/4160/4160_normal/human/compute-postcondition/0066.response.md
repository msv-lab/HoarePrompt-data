According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop. The loop executes for each value of `k` in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`**
