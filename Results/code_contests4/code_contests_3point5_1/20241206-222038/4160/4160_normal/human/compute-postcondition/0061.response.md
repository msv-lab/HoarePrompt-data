Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to be equal to the sum of the current value and the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The conditions for the loop to execute remain the same: `a[i - 1]` must be less than or equal to `b`. 
Output State: **The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated as specified.**
