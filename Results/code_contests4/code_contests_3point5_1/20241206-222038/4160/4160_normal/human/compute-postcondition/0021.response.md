Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values, `ix` is 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is such that `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is adjusted based on loop conditions, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` contains the values after the next iteration.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values, `ix` is 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is such that `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `k` is adjusted based on loop conditions, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` contains the values after the next iteration**
