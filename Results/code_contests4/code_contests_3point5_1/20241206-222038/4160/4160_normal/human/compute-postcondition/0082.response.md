Example Answer:
The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[0]]` for all iterations of the loop. `i` is 1, `ix` is assigned the value of `i & 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is in the range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.
Output State: **The final values of mem[ix][j+1][k] have been updated based on the previous values of mem[ix ^ 1][j][k] and the addition of mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[0]] for all iterations of the loop, i is 1, ix is assigned the value of i & 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, j is 1, for the loop to execute the first time k is in the range from a[i - 1] to b**
