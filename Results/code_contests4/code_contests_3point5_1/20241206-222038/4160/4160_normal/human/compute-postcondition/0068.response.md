Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]`, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `i` is valid.
Output State: **The final values of `mem[ix][j+1][k]` have been updated based on the previous values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` for all iterations of the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, and `i` is valid**
