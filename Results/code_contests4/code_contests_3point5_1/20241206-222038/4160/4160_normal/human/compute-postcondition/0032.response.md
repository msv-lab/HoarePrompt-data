Example Answer: 
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` represents the bitwise XOR operation. The values of `n`, `a`, `mem`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged. In order for the loop to execute one more time, it must satisfy the condition `a[i - 1] <= b`. Additionally, `j` is incremented by 1 after the assignment. 
Output State: **Values of `n`, `a`, `mem`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated; `a[i - 1] <= b` for one more loop execution; `j` is incremented by 1**
