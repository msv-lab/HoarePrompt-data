Example Answer: 
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged. The condition `a[i - 1] <= b` still holds true for one more loop execution. `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `b`. 
Output State: **Values of `n`, `a`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` remain unchanged; `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated; `a[i - 1] <= b` still holds true for one more loop execution; `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; for the loop to execute one more time `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `b**.
