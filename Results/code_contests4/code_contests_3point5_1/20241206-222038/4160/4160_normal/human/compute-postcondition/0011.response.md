Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `a` are adjusted based on loop conditions and function outputs. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values based on the function `rints()` and 3D list comprehension, `ix` is 0 or 1, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is adjusted based on loop conditions, `k` is adjusted based on loop conditions.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values based on the function `rints()` and 3D list comprehension, `ix` is 0 or 1, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is adjusted based on loop conditions, `k` is adjusted based on loop conditions**
