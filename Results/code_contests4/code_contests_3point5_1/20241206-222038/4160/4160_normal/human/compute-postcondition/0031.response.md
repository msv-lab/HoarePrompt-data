According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `i`. If `a[i - 1] <= b`, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, `mem`, `ix`, `m`, `i`, `k` will remain unchanged, and `mem[ix][j][k]` will be updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. So before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `a[i - 1] <= b`, `j` is incremented by 1.
