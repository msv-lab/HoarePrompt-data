According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, `m`, `i`, `k`, `ix`, and the values in `mem` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values, `ix` is 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` and `k` are adjusted based on loop conditions, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the given formula. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `mem` are assigned values, `ix` is 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` and `k` are adjusted based on loop conditions, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than `b`**
