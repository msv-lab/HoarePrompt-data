Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes a single string input and calculates the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can make by inserting one extra photo into the photobook he already has. The formula used in the program correctly calculates the number of distinct photobooks by considering all possible combinations of inserting one extra photo. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program has the correct formula to calculate the number of distinct photobooks, and it works as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
