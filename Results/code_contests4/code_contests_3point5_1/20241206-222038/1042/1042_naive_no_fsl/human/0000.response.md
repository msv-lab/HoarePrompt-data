Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of distinct photobooks that can be made by inserting one extra photo into the existing photobook. It simply calculates the total number of combinations possible by inserting one extra photo anywhere in the string, which is not the same as the number of distinct photobooks. 

For example, if the input string is "aa", the program will output 53, but the correct answer should be 51. This is because the photobooks "aa" and "aa" are not distinct from each other.
