Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The formula used in the program to calculate the number of distinct photobooks is incorrect. The correct formula should be (len(n) + 1) * 26, as we are inserting one extra photo at any position in the string of length len(n), resulting in len(n) + 1 possible positions to insert the extra photo. 

The correct program should be:
```
def func():
    n = raw_input()
    print((len(n) + 1) * 26)
```

This corrected program will output the correct number of distinct photobooks that can be made by inserting one extra photo into the existing photo booklet, as per the problem description.
