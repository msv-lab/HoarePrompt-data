Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an input string `n`, calculates the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can make by inserting one extra photo into the photobook he already has, and prints the result. 

The code calculates the number of distinct photobooks correctly by following the problem description. It considers all possible combinations of inserting one extra photo into the existing photo booklet. The formula used in the code `print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` accurately calculates the number of distinct photobooks that can be created.

Additionally, the output hints also align with the code by describing its functionality accurately. The hints mention that the code reads input from the user, calculates a value based on the length of the input string `n`, and prints the result, which is exactly what the code does. Therefore, based on the code logic and the output hints, the program is correct for all potential cases.
