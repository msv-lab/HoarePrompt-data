Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The program simply calculates `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` and prints the result, which is not the correct solution to the problem described.

The correct solution would involve generating all possible combinations of inserting one extra photo into the given string `s` and counting the distinct photobooks that can be created. The program should output the number of distinct photobooks that can be made, not a calculation based on the length of the input string. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
