Example Answer:
The code snippet tries to print the result of the expression `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)`. As there is no variable `n` defined in the initial state, the code will result in an error. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 20 and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `n`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 20 and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `n`**
