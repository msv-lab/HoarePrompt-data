#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 20.**
def func():
    n = raw_input()
    print(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user, calculates a value based on the length of the input string `n`, and prints the result. It does not accept any explicit parameters. The code does not align with the annotations provided. The function reads user input, calculates a value based on the input length, and prints the result without returning any value.
