Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of points that Alex can earn by choosing elements from the sequence according to the rules provided. The program maintains a frequency array to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the sequence and uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum points that can be earned. The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem requirements and handle all potential cases appropriately. Hence, the program is correct.
