Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of points Alex can earn by choosing elements from the sequence according to the rules specified in the problem. The program correctly calculates the frequency of each element in the sequence, then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum points that can be earned.

The program iterates through the elements in the sequence and calculates the maximum points that can be earned up to that point, taking into account the points earned from the current element and the points earned from the previous elements. This approach ensures that the program calculates the maximum points possible for any given sequence of integers.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
