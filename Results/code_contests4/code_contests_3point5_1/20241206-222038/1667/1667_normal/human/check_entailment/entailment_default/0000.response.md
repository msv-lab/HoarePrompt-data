Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program first reads the integer `n` representing the length of the sequence and then reads the sequence of `n` integers.
- It then initializes a `freq` list with zeros and a `dp` list with initial values `[0, freq[1]]`.
- The program then iterates through the input sequence, calculates the frequency of each element, and updates the `freq` list.
- After that, it calculates the maximum value based on the elements in the sequence and their frequencies and stores it in the `dp` list.
- Finally, it outputs the maximum value calculated based on the sequence.
- The program seems to follow the problem description for every potential case and the output hints also align with the code logic. There are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Hence, the correctness is deemed as True.
