Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input sequence, calculates the frequency of each element, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum points that can be earned by following the rules of the game described in the problem.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the maximum points that can be earned by choosing elements from the sequence based on the given rules. It considers all elements and their frequencies to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing points.
