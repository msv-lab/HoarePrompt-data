Example Answer:
The lambda function olws takes an array as input, converts each element to a string, joins them together, and then writes the result to standard output with a newline character at the end. The function does not modify the input array or any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive)**
