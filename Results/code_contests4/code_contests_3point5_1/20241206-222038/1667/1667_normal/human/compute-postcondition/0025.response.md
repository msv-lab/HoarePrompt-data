Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the length of a sequence and a sequence of `n` integers. It then calculates the maximum value based on the elements in the sequence and their frequencies. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it operates on the input sequence to determine the maximum value. **
