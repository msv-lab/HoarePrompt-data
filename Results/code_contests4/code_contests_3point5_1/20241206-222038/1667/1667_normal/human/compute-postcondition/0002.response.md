Example Answer:
The lambda function `ol` takes an input array `arr`, converts each element to a string, joins them with a space, and appends a newline character at the end. The variable names `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive)**
