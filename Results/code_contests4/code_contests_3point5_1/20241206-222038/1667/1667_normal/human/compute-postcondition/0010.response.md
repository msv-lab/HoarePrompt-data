According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is assigned the value returned by the `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105, `freq` is a list of 100001 elements with the value at index `a[i]` increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 and `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105, `freq` is a list of 100001 elements with the value at index `a[i]` increased by 1, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
