Example Answer:
The value of `a[i]` is used as an index to access the `freq` list and increment the value at that index by 1. The value of `a[i]` falls between 1 and 105, and it is assumed that the value at that index in `freq` is initially 0. Therefore, after execution, the value at index `a[i]` in `freq` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105, `freq` is a list of 100001 elements with the value at index `a[i]` increased by 1, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
