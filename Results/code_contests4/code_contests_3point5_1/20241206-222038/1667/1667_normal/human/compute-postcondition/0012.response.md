According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
