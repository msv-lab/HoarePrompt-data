Example Answer:
The lambda function `os` is defined to take an input `i` and write it to the standard output followed by a new line. The function does not affect the initial state variables `n` and `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive)**
