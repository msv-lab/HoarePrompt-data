According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 
Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` should be greater than or equal to 2
- `a` should consist of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive)
- `freq` should be updated based on the elements in `a`
- `dp` should be updated based on the frequency of the element 1 in the list `a`

State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `freq` is updated based on the elements in `a`, `dp` is a list containing 0 and the frequency of the element 1 in the list `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
