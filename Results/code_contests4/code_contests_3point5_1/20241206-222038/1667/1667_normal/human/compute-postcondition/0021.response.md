Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105, `freq` is updated based on the elements in `a`, `dp` is updated based on the criteria specified in the loop, for the loop to execute a third time `n` is greater than or equal to 3, dp appends the maximum value between dp[i - 1] and dp[i - 2] + freq[i] * i**
