Example Answer:
The value of `dp` is assigned a list containing 0 and the frequency of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since the values of `n`, `a`, and `freq` are not directly affected by this assignment, the output state is: `n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `freq` is a list of 100001 elements with the value at index `a[i]` increased by the frequency of `a[i]` in the list `a`, and `dp` is a list containing 0 and the frequency of the element 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `freq` is a list of 100001 elements with the value at index `a[i]` increased by the frequency of `a[i]` in the list `a`, `dp` is a list containing 0 and the frequency of the element 1 in the list `a`**
