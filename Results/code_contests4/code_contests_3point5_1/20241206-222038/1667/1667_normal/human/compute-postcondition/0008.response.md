According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` returned by the `ti()` function is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `freq` is a list of 100001 elements all initially set to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `freq` is a list of 100001 elements, all initially set to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
