Example Answer:
The lambda function `ma` takes two parameters: `fxn` which represents a function and `ti` which represents a string of integers separated by spaces. It then applies the function `fxn` to each integer in the string `ti`. The sequence `a` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive)**
