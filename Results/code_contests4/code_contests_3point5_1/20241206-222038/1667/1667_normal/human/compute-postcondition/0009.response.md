The code snippet increments the value at the index `a[i]` in the `freq` list by 1.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `freq` is a list of 100001 elements with the value at index `a[i]` increased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
