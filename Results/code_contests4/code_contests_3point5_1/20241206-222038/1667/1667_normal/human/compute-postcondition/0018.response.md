According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `freq` is updated based on the elements in `a`, `dp` is a list containing 0 and the frequency of the element 1 in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
