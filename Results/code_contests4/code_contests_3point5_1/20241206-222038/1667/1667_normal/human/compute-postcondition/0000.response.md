Example Answer:
The lambda function `ti` is defined to read input from stdin and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variables `n` and the sequence `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer. The sequence a consists of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).**
