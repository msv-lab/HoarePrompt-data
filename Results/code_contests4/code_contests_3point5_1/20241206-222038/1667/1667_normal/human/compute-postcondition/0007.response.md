Example Answer:
The list `freq` is initialized with a length of 10^5 + 1, where each element is 0. This means `freq` is a list of 100001 elements, all initially set to 0. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the integer returned by `ti()` function, `a` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `freq` is a list of 100001 elements, all initially set to 0**.
