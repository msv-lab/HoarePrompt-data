Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of points that Alex can earn by following the rules of the game. The program first reads the input, then calculates the frequency of each element in the sequence, and finally uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum points that can be earned. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, therefore the correctness of the program is True.
