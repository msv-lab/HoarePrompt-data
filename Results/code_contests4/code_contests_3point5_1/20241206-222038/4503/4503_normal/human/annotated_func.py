#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. It then performs a series of checks based on these parameters and returns different values accordingly. The function handles cases where the input values lead to returning False, updating the line array, and returning the value of `pos + 1`. However, the annotations do not accurately reflect the behavior of the function for all potential cases, so the functionality includes the actual behavior of the code rather than relying solely on the annotations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four integer parameters: `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left`. It iterates through the elements of `side`, modifying the variables `pos` and `cross` accordingly. If certain conditions are met, it calls another function `func_1` with specific arguments. The function returns False, False in multiple cases, and in the end, it returns the final value of 'cross' and the updated value of 'pos' after adding 1.
