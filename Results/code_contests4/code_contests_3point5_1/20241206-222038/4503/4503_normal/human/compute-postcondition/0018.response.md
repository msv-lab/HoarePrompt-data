Postcondition: ***n, m, d are integers such that 1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30; end is the length of the first element of the list side; pos is assigned the value of start - 1, add is decreased by 1, cross is assigned the value of 0, for the loop to execute the first time side is a list with at least 1 element, step is 0, line is a copy of the first element in the list side. Additionally, if add is equal to step, then cross is false. After the if-else block executes, the program variables retain their initial values and relationships based on the conditions met during the execution of the if and else parts. If pos > 0 and line[pos - 1] is true, then pos is greater than 0 and line[pos - 1] is true. If pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false, then pos is less than end and line[pos] is true.***
