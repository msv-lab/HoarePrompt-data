Postcondition: ***`n, m, d` are integers such that `1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30`. `end` is the length of the next element of the list `side`. `pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is assigned the value returned by `func_1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `side` is a list with at least 3 elements. `step` and `line` are updated based on the third element in the list `side`, `line` is a shallow copy of the original list `line`. If `cross` is False, the program returns False, False. After the execution of the if else block, `pos` is decreased by 1 if the condition is met, otherwise `pos` remains the same.***
