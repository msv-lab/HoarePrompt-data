Example Answer:
`cross` is assigned the result of a function `func_1` with parameters `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. The values of `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left` are not provided, so the exact value of `cross` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, d are integers such that 1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30; end is the length of the first element of the list `side`; pos is assigned the value of start - 1, add is decreased by 1, cross is assigned the value of 0, for the loop to execute the first time `side` is a list with at least 1 element, `step` is 0, `line` is a copy of the first element in the list `side`. Additionally, add is equal to step.
