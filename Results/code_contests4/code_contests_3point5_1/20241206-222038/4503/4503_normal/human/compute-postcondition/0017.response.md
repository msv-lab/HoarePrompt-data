Postcondition: ***n, m, d are integers such that 1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30; end is the length of the first element of the list side; pos is assigned the value of start, add is decreased by 1, cross is assigned the value of 0; if add is equal to step, then cross is false; pos is less than or equal to 0 or line[pos - 1] is false; pos is less than end and line[pos] is true.***
