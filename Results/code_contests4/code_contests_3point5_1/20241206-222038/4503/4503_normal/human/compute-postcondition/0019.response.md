According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `step` and `line`. If there are more elements in the list `side`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n, m, d, end, pos, add, cross, side, step, line` have specific values and relationships. For the loop to execute one more time, `side` must have at least one more element, and the `step` and `line` variables should be updated based on the next element in the list.

State: **`n, m, d` are integers such that `1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30`; `end` is the length of the next element of the list `side`; `pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is assigned the value of `0`, for the loop to execute one more time `side` is a list with at least 2 elements, `step` and `line` are updated based on the next element in the list `side`.**
