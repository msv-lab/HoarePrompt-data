Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. The value returned by the function is assigned to `cross`. The values of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n, m, d` are integers such that `1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30`; `end` is the length of the next element of the list `side`; `pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is assigned the value returned by `func_1`, for the loop to execute one more time `side` is a list with at least 2 elements, `step` and `line` are updated based on the next element in the list `side`, `line` is a shallow copy of the original list `line`**
