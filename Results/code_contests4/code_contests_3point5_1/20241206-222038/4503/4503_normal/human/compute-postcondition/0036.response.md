Example Answer: 
`pos` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `pos` is `start - 1`, so after execution, `pos` becomes `start`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, d` are integers such that `1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30`, `end` is the length of the next element of the list `side`, `pos` is `start`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is assigned the value returned by `func_1`, `side` is a list with at least 3 elements, `step` and `line` are updated based on the third element in the list `side`, `line` is a shallow copy of the original list `line`. If `cross` is False, the program returns False, False. After the execution of the if else block, `pos` is decreased by 1 if the condition is met, otherwise `pos` remains the same.
