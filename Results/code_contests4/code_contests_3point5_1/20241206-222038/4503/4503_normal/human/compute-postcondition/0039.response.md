Output State: **`n, m, d` are integers such that `1 < n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ d ≤ 30`. `end` is the length of the last element of the list `side`. `pos` is either assigned the value of `start - len(side[-1])` or `start - len(side[-1]) - 1`, `add` is decreased by the number of elements in `side`, `cross` is the final value returned by `func_1`. After the loop has finished executing, the values of the variables will be based on the conditions met during the iterations. If the loop does not execute, the values of the variables will remain the same as the initial state.**
