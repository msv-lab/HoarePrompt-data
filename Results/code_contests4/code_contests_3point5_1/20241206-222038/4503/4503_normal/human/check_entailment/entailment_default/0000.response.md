After analyzing the provided code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, I believe the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function checks for various conditions based on the input parameters and updates the line array accordingly. It correctly handles cases where a horizontal line can be added to reach the hit position while maintaining the constraints of the problem description.
- The `func_2` function iterates through the side array, updating the position and checking for the addition of a horizontal line. It correctly considers both left and right directions for adding the horizontal line and ensures that the horizontal line does not cross the vertical lines.
- The main part of the code reads the input, calls `func_2` with different parameters to find the optimal step to add a horizontal line, and then checks if the hit position can be reached. It correctly handles the different scenarios and prints the output as required by the problem description.
- The output hints also align with the code behavior and provide a clear explanation of how the functions should work in different cases. The code implementation covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the hit position can be reached by adding a horizontal line within the constraints provided.
