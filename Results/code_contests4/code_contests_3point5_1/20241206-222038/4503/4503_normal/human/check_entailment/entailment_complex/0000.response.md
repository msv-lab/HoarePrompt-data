Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code includes two functions, func_1 and func_2, which work together to determine if the hit can be reached in the Amidakuji game. The functions follow the problem description by checking various conditions such as drawing horizontal lines next to vertical lines, not crossing vertical lines, and ensuring only one hit is present. The annotations provide insights into the behavior of the functions, which align with the requirements of the problem description. Overall, the code appears to cover all potential cases and is consistent with the problem description.
