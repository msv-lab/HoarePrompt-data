The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. It then performs a series of checks based on these parameters and returns different values accordingly. The function handles cases where the input values lead to returning False, updating the line array, and returning the value of `pos + 1`. However, the annotations do not accurately reflect the behavior of the function for all potential cases, so the functionality includes the actual behavior of the code rather than relying solely on the annotations.
