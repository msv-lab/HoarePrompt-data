Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description by implementing two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to simulate the Amidakuji game. The program reads the input data, iterates through the possible steps of adding horizontal lines, and checks if the hit can be reached. The conditions specified in the problem description, such as not crossing vertical lines and only adding one horizontal line, are appropriately handled in the program logic. Additionally, the program outputs the correct values based on whether the hit can be reached or not. Overall, the program seems to cover all the requirements and edge cases specified in the problem description.
