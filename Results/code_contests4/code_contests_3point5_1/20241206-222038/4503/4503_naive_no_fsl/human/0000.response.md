Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program follows the problem description by checking the conditions for adding a horizontal line next to a vertical line in order to reach the hit. It iterates through different steps and directions to find the correct position to draw the horizontal line. The logic seems sound and there are no obvious violations of the given conditions. Additionally, the program handles multiple test cases and terminates correctly when the input is 0.
