Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations mention specific cases like when the length of string `s` is 1 or 2, but the code lacks detailed documentation and handling for all possible cases outlined in the problem description. Additionally, the code does not explicitly check for all occurrences of string `s` in string `t` as required by the problem description. This lack of comprehensive coverage for all potential cases indicates a discrepancy between the code and the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is questionable.
