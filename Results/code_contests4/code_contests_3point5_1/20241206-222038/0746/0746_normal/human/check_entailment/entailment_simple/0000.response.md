Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. The program consists of two functions, where `func_1` is responsible for converting the compressed strings into a list of blocks and `func_2` calculates the number of occurrences of string `s` in string `t`.

The `func_1` function correctly processes the compressed strings `t` and `s` into a list of blocks, ensuring that the compressed form is correctly represented for further processing.

The `func_2` function correctly calculates the number of occurrences of string `s` in string `t` by iterating through the blocks and checking for matching conditions as described in the problem description. The function handles cases where the length of `s` is 1, 2, or more with appropriate conditions to count the occurrences accurately.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality for finding occurrences of string `s` in string `t`.
