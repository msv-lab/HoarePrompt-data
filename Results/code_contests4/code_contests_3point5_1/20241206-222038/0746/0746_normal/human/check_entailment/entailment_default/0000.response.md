Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. 

Firstly, the code lacks proper documentation and explanation of the functions' purpose and expected behavior, making it difficult to understand the logic behind some parts of the code.

Secondly, the output hints for Function 2 mention that the variable n should be a positive integer, which is not reflected in the code. This discrepancy indicates a deviation from the problem description.

Additionally, the code seems to have issues with handling edge cases and might not cover all possible scenarios accurately. Without comprehensive documentation and clear logic, it is challenging to determine the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the output hints, the correctness of the program is deemed to be False.
