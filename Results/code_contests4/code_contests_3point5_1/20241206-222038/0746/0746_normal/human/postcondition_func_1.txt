The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`. It processes the strings `t` and `s` based on predefined conditions specified in each case. 

- Case 1: If the length of string `s` is 1, it iterates over elements in `t` and updates `ans` based on the condition `c(i, s[0])`.
- Case 2: If the length of string `s` is 2, it iterates over elements in `t` and increments `ans` each time the conditions `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])` are met.
- Case 3: For all other cases, the function constructs a new list `v` by combining elements from `s` and `t`, calculates a prefix function `p` for `v`, and then iterates over `v` to update `ans` based on specific conditions.

The function returns different values depending on the specified cases. However, the annotation states that the precondition is that `n` and `m` are positive integers, which is not reflected in the code. Additionally, the code lacks detailed documentation regarding the function's purpose and expected behavior, making it challenging to understand its full functionality.
