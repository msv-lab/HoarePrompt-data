According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of list `v`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and the length of list `v` is greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 which makes `i` equal to 3.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`, loop execution stops, `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`**
