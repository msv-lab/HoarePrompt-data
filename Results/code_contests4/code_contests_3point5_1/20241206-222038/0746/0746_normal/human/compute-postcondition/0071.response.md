According to the code, the loop can be executed as long as the length of list `v` is greater than 1. The loop iterates over the range of `len(v)`, so it will execute for each element in the list. 

Before the loop starts, the initial states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be updated to 0 (since the loop starts from 0)
- `j` should be updated to the last value of `p`
- `v[j]` should be equal to `v[i]`

Additionally, based on the information provided, we can assume that `p` should have at least one element for the loop to execute. 

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the last value of `p`, `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`, `p` has at least one element**
