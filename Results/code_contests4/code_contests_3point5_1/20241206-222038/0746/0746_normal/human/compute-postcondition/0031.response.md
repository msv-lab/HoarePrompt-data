According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `v` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `len(v)` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
