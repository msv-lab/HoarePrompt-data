The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`. The precondition specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000. Each part of string `t` and `s` is represented as "li-ci" where `li` is a positive integer representing the length of the block and `ci` is a lowercase English letter.

After executing the function body, the program has three cases of output:
Case 1: The program returns the updated value of 'ans' based on the condition 'c(i, s[0])' for all elements in string 't'.
Case 2: The program returns the number of times the condition c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1]) is satisfied for i in the range of len(t) - 1.
Case 3: The program returns the total number of times the conditions `p[i] == len(s) - 2`, `c(v[i - p[i]], s[0])`, and `c(v[i + 1], s[-1])` are all true for all elements in `p`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept strings `t` and `s`, along with a function `c`, and return different values based on the specified conditions for each case.
