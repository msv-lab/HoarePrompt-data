Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is dependent on the value of `p[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i], `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`**
