Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. Since `j` was assigned the value of `p[j]` previously, the new value of `j` will be based on the value of `p` at the index of the previous value of `j`. The loop will execute again if the new value of `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `j` is assigned the new value based on `p`, `p[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `j`, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than 0 and `v[j]` needs to be not equal to `v[i`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `j` is assigned the new value based on `p`, `p[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `j`, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than 0 and `v[j]` needs to be not equal to `v[i]`**
