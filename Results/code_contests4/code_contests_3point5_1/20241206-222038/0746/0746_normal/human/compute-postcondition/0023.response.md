According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the lengths of strings `t` and `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `t` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of `t` is at least 3, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must have a length of at least 4.
State: **For the loop to execute a second time, the length of t must be at least 4, i is 2**
