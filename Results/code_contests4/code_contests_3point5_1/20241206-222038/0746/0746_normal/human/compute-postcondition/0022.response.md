Postcondition: ***n, m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000. Each part of string t and s is represented as "li-ci" where li is a positive integer representing the length of the block and ci is a lowercase English letter. Ans is increased by 1, the length of s is 2, for the loop to execute the second time the length of t is at least 3, i is 1. When c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1]) are satisfied, the program executes the if block.***
