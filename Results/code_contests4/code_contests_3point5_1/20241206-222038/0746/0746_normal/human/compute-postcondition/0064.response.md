Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `j` is assigned the new value based on `p`, `p[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `j`, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than 0 and `v[j]` needs to be not equal to `v[i]`, `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j]`**
