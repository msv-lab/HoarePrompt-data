Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `p[i - 1]`, where `i` is 1. Since the value of `i` is 1, `p[i - 1]` is equivalent to `p[0]`. The value of `p[0]` is not given in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is dependent on the value of `p[0]`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is dependent on the value of `p[0]`**
