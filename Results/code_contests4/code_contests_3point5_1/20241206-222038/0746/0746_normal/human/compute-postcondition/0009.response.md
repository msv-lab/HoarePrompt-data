According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements left in the `t` list. If there are still elements left in the `t` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are positive integers, and each part of strings `t` and `s` is represented as "li-ci". If `c(i, s[0])`, `ans` is updated by adding the difference between the first element of `i` and the first element of `s` plus 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be elements left in the `t` list.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, each part of strings `t` and `s` is represented as "li-ci", elements are left in `t` for the loop to execute another time**
