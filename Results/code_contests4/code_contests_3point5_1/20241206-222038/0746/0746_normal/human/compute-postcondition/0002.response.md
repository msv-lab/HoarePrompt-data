According to the code, the loop will iterate over each element in string `t`. Since the length of string `s` is equal to 1, the loop will execute as long as `t` is not empty. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, each part of string `t` and `s` is represented as "li-ci" where li is a positive integer representing the length of the block and ci is a lowercase English letter, `ans` is 0, and `t` is not empty.
