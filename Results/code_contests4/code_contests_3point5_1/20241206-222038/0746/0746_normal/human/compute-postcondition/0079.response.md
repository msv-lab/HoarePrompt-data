Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `ans` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is updated to 2 if the conditions are met, otherwise `ans` remains 1**
