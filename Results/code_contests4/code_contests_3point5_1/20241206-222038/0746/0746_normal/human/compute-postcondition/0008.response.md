Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, each part of string `t` and `s` is represented as "li-ci" where `li` is a positive integer representing the length of the block and `ci` is a lowercase English letter. If `c(i, s[0])`, `ans` is updated by adding the difference between the first element of `i` and the first element of `s` plus 1 for the loop to execute one more time, there are elements left in `t`.***
