Example Answer:
`j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. The value of `j` is greater than 0, and `p[j]` is also a positive integer. This update loops back to update `j` again until a condition is met where `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` is greater than 0, `j` is continuously updated to the value of `p[j]` and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` is greater than 0, `j` is continuously updated to the value of `p[j]` and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]**.
