Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. This does not affect the values of `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within a certain range, and the format of the strings `t` and `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000. Each part of string t and s is represented as "li-ci" where li is a positive integer representing the length of the block and ci is a lowercase English letter. ans is 0**.
