According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of string t is at least 2. Before the loop starts, n and m are positive integers and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000 is already given. The length of s is not equal to 1 and is 2. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to specify that the length of string t is at least 2, ans is 0, and i is 0.
State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000. Each part of string t and s is represented as "li-ci" where li is a positive integer representing the length of the block and ci is a lowercase English letter. ans is 0, the length of s is 2, for the loop to execute the first time the length of t is at least 2, i is 0**
