Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the difference between the first element of `i` and the first element of the first element of `s`, plus 1. The values of `i`, `s`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, each part of strings `t` and `s` is represented as "li-ci", elements are left in `t` for the loop to execute another time, `ans` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, each part of strings `t` and `s` is represented as "li-ci", elements are left in `t` for the loop to execute another time, `ans` is updated accordingly**
