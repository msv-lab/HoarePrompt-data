According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `v[j]`, and `v[i]`. Right before the loop, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is dependent on the value of `p[0]`. In order for the loop to execute the first time, `j` needs to be greater than 0 and `v[j]` should not be equal to `v[i]`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is dependent on the value of `p[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]`**
