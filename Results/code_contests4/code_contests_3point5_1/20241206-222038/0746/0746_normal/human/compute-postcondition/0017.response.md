Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000. Each part of string t and s is represented as "li-ci" where li is a positive integer representing the length of the block and ci is a lowercase English letter. ans is 0, the length of s is 2, for the loop to execute the first time the length of t is at least 2, i is 0. Additionally, c(t[i], s[0]) is true and c(t[i + 1], s[1]) is true.***
