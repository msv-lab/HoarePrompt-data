According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of string `t`. If `i` is less than the length of `t` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of `t` is at least 2, i is 0. Since Ans is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `t` must be at least 3, and i is increased by 1.
State: **n, m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000. Each part of string t and s is represented as "li-ci" where li is a positive integer representing the length of the block and ci is a lowercase English letter. Ans is increased by 1, the length of s is 2, for the loop to execute the second time the length of t is at least 3, i is 1.**
