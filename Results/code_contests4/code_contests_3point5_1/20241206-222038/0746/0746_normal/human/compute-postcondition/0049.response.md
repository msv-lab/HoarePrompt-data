Example Answer:
The value of `j` is updated to the new value of `p[j]`. The value of `j` changes according to the value of `p[j]` in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is continuously updated to the new value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is continuously updated to the new value of `p[j]`**
