Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `ans` is 0, `len(v)` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is continuously updated to the value of `p[j]`, `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]` for the loop to execute again, `j` becomes 0 if `v[j]` is equal to `v[i`, then `j` is increased by 1. `p[i]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
