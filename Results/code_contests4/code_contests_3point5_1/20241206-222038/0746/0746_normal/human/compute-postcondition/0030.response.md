Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200,000. Each part of string t and s is represented as "li-ci" where li is a positive integer representing the length of the block and ci is a lowercase English letter. `ans` is 0. The length of s is not equal to 1, and len(s) is not equal to 2, `v` is the result of the concatenation operation, p is a list of zeros with a length equal to the length of `v`.**
