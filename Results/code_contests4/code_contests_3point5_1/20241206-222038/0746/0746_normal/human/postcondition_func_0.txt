The function func_1 accepts a list `ar` and iterates through each element, splitting it into an integer `x` and a character `c`. It then compresses the elements based on the character `c`, combining consecutive elements with the same character. The function returns a list of non-empty lists containing the compressed form of the input strings `t` and `s` after all iterations of the loop have finished. The function handles the case where the input list `ar` is empty by returning an empty list.
