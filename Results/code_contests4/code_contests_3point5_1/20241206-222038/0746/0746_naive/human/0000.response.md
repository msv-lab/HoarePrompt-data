Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find all occurrences of string s in string t. The function func_2 seems to be implementing the KMP string matching algorithm, but it is not handling the case where the string s has multiple blocks (more than 2). Since the problem description states that the compressed strings may have multiple blocks, the program fails to find all occurrences in such cases.

Additionally, the code snippet provided uses raw_input() and map() functions which are not valid in Python 3, thus the program will not run as is in Python 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
