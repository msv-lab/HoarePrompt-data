Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. The `func_2` function is attempting to find occurrences of string `s` in string `t` using the KMP algorithm, but the implementation is incorrect. The code is not handling the compressed form of the strings correctly and is not counting the occurrences of `s` in `t` accurately.

A potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input contains multiple occurrences of the same character in the compressed form of the strings, for example:

Input:
```
2 1
3-a 4-a
2-a
```

Expected Output: 2

The correct output should be 2, as the compressed form of `t` is "aa" and the compressed form of `s` is "a", which appears twice in `t`. However, the program may not count this correctly due to the incorrect implementation of the KMP algorithm.
