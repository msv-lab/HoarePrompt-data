Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly determines the maximum number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have an even size. The program first checks if the total number of vertices is odd, and if so, it prints -1 because it is impossible to remove edges to satisfy the property. Then, it defines two functions to calculate the size of connected components. The program iterates through all edges and calculates the minimum size of the two vertices connected by the edge. If the minimum size is even, it increments the count of edges that can be removed. Finally, it prints the total count of edges that can be removed. The program handles all potential cases as required by the problem description.
