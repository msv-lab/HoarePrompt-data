The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. It iterates through a loop and keeps track of unique elements seen during the iterations. The function returns the total number of unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations. The code may not handle the case where the initial value of `b` is not added to the `seen` set, potentially leading to an incorrect count of unique elements. This missing functionality should be considered when using the function.
