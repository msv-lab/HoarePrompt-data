The function `func_2` accepts an integer `node`, representing a vertex in a tree. The input tree is represented as a list of edges. If the `node` is already in the set `seen`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it adds the `node` to the set `seen`, initializes the size of the subtree rooted at `node`, and recursively calculates the size by calling `func_2` on all neighbors of `node`. The function then returns the updated size of the subtree rooted at the input `node`.
