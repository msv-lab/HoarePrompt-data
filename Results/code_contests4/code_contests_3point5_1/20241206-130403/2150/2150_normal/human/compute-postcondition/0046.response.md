The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. The program iterates through a loop and keeps track of unique elements seen during the iterations. The function returns the total number of unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, iterate through a loop, and return the total number of unique elements seen during the iterations.
