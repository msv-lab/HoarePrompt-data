Example Answer:
The last element from `Q` is removed and assigned to `a` using the `popleft()` function. `seen` should be updated to include the removed element `a`. The count `cnt` should be adjusted accordingly. The loop will execute again if `E[a]` contains at least one element. 
Output State: **`Q` is updated without the last element, `seen` contains all unique elements seen including `a`, `cnt` is adjusted, loop may execute again based on `E[a]` containing elements, `a` contains the last element removed from `Q`**
