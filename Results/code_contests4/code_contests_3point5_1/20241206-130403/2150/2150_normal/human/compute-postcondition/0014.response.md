Example Answer:
The value of `sz[node]` is incremented by the value returned by `func_2(neigh)`. The previous value of `sz[node]` is unknown, and the value returned by `func_2(neigh)` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `neigh` is printed, and `sz[node]` is updated by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`.
Output State: **The value of `neigh` is printed, and `sz[node]` is updated by the return value of `func_2(neigh)**
