According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `E[node]` and `neigh`. If there are more elements in `E[node]` that have not been iterated over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `neigh` was printed and `sz[node]` was updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `E[node]` to iterate over.
State: **The value of `neigh` will be printed, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute again there must be at least one more element in `E[node]`**
