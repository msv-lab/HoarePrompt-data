Example Answer:
The value of `sz[node]` is incremented by the result of `func_2(neigh)`. The previous values of `sz[node]` and `neigh` are unknown, so the output state is: The value of `neigh` will be printed, and `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`.
Output State: **The value of `neigh` will be printed, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)**
