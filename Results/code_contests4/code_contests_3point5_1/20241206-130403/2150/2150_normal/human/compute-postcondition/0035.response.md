Example Answer: 
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same as before the execution of the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `Q` is updated without the last element, `seen` contains all unique elements seen including `a`, `cnt` is adjusted, loop may execute again based on `E[a]` containing elements, `a` contains the last element removed from `Q`. If `a` is in `seen`, the state remains the same as before the if statement.
Output State: **`Q` is updated without the last element, `seen` contains all unique elements seen including `a`, `cnt` is adjusted, loop may execute again based on `E[a]` containing elements, `a` contains the last element removed from `Q`. If `a` is in `seen`, the state remains the same as before the if statement, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
