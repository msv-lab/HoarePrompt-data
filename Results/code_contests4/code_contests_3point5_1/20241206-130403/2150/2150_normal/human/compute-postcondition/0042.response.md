Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the list `Q`, so the list `Q` now contains the updated elements. The other variables remain the same as their states are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Q` is updated with the last element of `E[a] and `b`, `seen` contains all unique elements seen including `a` and `b`, `cnt` is adjusted, `a` contains the last element removed from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the third time `E[a]` still contains elements, `a` is updated with the last element removed from `Q`, `b` is the next element in `E[a] after the second iteration, and `b` is appended to the list `Q`.
Output State: **`Q` is updated with the last element of `E[a] and `b`, `seen` contains all unique elements seen including `a` and `b`, `cnt` is adjusted, `a` contains the last element removed from `Q`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the third time `E[a]` still contains elements, `a` is updated with the last element removed from `Q`, `b` is the next element in `E[a] after the second iteration, and `b` is appended to the list `Q`**
