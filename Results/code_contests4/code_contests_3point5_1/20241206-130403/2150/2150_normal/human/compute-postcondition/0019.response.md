Example Answer: 
The first element of the deque `Q` is removed and assigned to variable `a`. The deque `Q` now has one less element. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Q` is a deque with elements excluding `a` and all elements added to `Q` from previous iterations, `seen` is a set containing all unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations, `cnt` is adjusted accordingly, and `E[a]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute again, `a` contains the first element removed from `Q`.
Output State: **`Q` is a deque with elements excluding `a` and all elements added to `Q` from previous iterations, `seen` is a set containing all unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations, `cnt` is adjusted accordingly, and `E[a]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute again, `a` contains the first element removed from `Q`**
