According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `Q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is empty. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute again, `Q` needs to be adjusted to not empty.

State: **`Q` is not empty, `seen` contains all unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations including `a` and `b`, `cnt` is adjusted accordingly, `E[a]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute again, `a` contains the last element removed from `Q`**
