Example Answer:
The `node` is added to the set `seen`. This ensures that the `node` is marked as seen in the program. The other variables and the input tree list of edges remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The input tree is represented as a list of edges where each edge is a tuple of two integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing vertices connected by the edge. The edges form a tree. The node is now marked as seen.
