The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `node`, where `node` is an integer representing a vertex in a tree. The input tree is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of two integers representing vertices connected by the edge. The edges form a tree. If the program encounters Case_1, it returns 0. If the program encounters Case_2, it returns the updated size of the tree rooted at the input `node`, calculated based on the return values of calling `func_2(neigh)` for all neighbors `neigh` of the input `node` in the tree. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `node` representing a vertex in a tree, and return 0 if Case_1 is encountered, or return the size of the subtree rooted at `node` if Case_2 is encountered.
