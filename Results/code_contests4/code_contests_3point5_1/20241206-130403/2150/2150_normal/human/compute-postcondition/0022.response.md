Example Answer: 
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, so after execution, `cnt` is increased by 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Q` is a deque with elements excluding `a` and all elements added to `Q` from previous iterations, `seen` is a set containing all unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations, `cnt` is adjusted accordingly, and `E[a]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute again, `a` contains the first element removed from `Q`. If `a` is in `seen`, no changes are made to the data structures, `cnt` is increased by 1.
