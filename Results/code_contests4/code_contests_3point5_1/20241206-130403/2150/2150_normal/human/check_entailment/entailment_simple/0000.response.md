Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not directly address the problem description of determining the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be related to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
