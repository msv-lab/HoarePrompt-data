Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to correctly parse the input and build the tree structure from the given edges.
- The function `func_2` uses recursion to calculate the size of the subtree rooted at a specific node. It keeps track of the nodes seen and the size of each subtree. 
- The code checks if the total number of vertices in the tree is odd, if it is, it immediately prints -1 and exits, which is a valid check according to the problem description.
- The code then identifies the leaf nodes in the tree and chooses one of them as the root to start calculating the subtree sizes.
- After calculating the subtree sizes, the code iterates through the edges and counts the number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size.
- The code seems to correctly handle the logic of counting the edges that can be removed based on the sizes of the subtrees.

However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where the tree has only 1 vertex. In this case, the code should output 0 as the maximum number of edges that can be removed. This edge case is not covered in the code, leading to a potential incorrect output for this scenario.
