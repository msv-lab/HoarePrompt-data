Correctness: **True**

Explanation: Based on the problem description and the provided annotations, the code seems to correctly determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size. The function `func_1` keeps track of unique elements seen in the tree traversal, and the function `func_2` calculates the size of subtrees rooted at different nodes. These functions, along with the main logic of the program, appear to align with the requirements of the problem. Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description seem to be handled correctly by the code. Since no potential case has been identified where the code does not work as expected, the correctness is deemed as True.
