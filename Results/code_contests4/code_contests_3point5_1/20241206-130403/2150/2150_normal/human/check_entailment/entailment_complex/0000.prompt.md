You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the size of the tree. 

The next n - 1 lines contain two integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) each, describing the vertices connected by the i-th edge.

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

Output

Output a single integer k — the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size, or -1 if it is impossible to remove edges in order to satisfy this property.

Examples

Input

2 4
4 1
3 1


Output

1

Input

3
1 2
1 3


Output

-1

Input

10
7 1
8 4
8 10
4 7
6 5
9 3

Output

4

Input

2
1 2


Output

0

Note

In the first example you can remove the edge between vertices 1 and 4. The graph after that will have two connected components with two vertices in each.

In the second example you can't remove edges in such a way that all components have even number of vertices, so the answer is -1.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    Q = deque()
    Q.append(a)
    seen = {b}
    cnt = 0
    while Q:
        a = Q.popleft()
        
        if a in seen:
            continue
        
        cnt += 1
        
        seen.add(a)
        
        for b in E[a]:
            Q.append(b)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `Q` is an empty deque, `seen` contains all unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations, `cnt` is the total number of unique elements seen, `a` is the last element removed from `Q`
    return cnt
    #The program returns the total number of unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. It iterates through a loop and keeps track of unique elements seen during the iterations. The function returns the total number of unique elements seen throughout the loop iterations. The code may not handle the case where the initial value of `b` is not added to the `seen` set, potentially leading to an incorrect count of unique elements. This missing functionality should be considered when using the function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The input tree is represented as a list of edges where each edge is a tuple of two integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing vertices connected by the edge. The edges form a tree.**
def func_2(node):
    print(node)
    if (node in seen) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The input tree is represented as a list of edges where each edge is a tuple of two integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing vertices connected by the edge. The edges form a tree. The node is not in seen.
    seen.add(node)
    sz[node] = 1
    for neigh in E[node]:
        print(neigh)
        
        sz[node] += func_2(neigh)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sz[node]` is updated based on the return values of `func_2(neigh)` for all neighbors in the tree rooted at `node`.
    return sz[node]
    #The program returns the updated size of the tree rooted at 'node', which is calculated based on the return values of 'func_2(neigh)' for all neighbors in the tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `node`, representing a vertex in a tree. The input tree is represented as a list of edges. If the `node` is already in the set `seen`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it adds the `node` to the set `seen`, initializes the size of the subtree rooted at `node`, and recursively calculates the size by calling `func_2` on all neighbors of `node`. The function then returns the updated size of the subtree rooted at the input `node`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
