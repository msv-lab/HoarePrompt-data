Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum possible number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size. The issue lies in the implementation of the `func_2` function. The function is supposed to calculate the size of each subtree starting from a leaf node, but it is not correctly updating the size of each node in the subtree. This leads to incorrect calculations of the sizes of the connected components and ultimately incorrect result for the maximum number of edges that can be removed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for some potential cases and the correctness should be marked as False.
