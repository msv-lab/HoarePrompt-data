Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for a, b, x, and y.
- The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y and reduces x and y accordingly.
- The program then calculates the minimum possible value for the reduced size model based on a, b, x, and y.
- The program prints the screen parameters of the reduced size model if the answer exists, and prints 0 0 otherwise.
- The program uses binary search to find the optimal reduced size model with the maximum total area.
- The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each case as per the problem description.
