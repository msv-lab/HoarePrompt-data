Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes in the input values of a, b, x, and y. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y, and divides x and y by this gcd. It then calculates the minimum possible value of the reduced screen size based on the ratio x:y and the dimensions a and b. The program then prints the reduced screen size if it is possible, otherwise it prints 0 0.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible reduced screen size that still fits within the dimensions a and b. It handles the case where the answer does not exist by printing 0 0. The logic of the program seems to be correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
