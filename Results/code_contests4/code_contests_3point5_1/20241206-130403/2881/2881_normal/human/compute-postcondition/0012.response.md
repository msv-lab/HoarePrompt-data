According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, the loop can continue with the same variables. However, if either `x * mid > a` or `y * mid > b`, then `en` needs to be updated to `mid - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mid`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en` are positive integers. If `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, the loop continues with the same variables. Otherwise, `en` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
