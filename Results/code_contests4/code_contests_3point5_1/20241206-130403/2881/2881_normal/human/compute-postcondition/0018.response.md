Output State: **`mid` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y` are positive integers. After the loop finishes executing, `be` will be equal to the maximum value of `mid` such that `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`, while `en` will be equal to the maximum value of `mid` minus 1. The values `be * x` and `be * y` are printed.**
