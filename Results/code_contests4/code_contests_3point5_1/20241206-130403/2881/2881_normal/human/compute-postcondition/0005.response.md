Example Answer:
`en` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is a positive integer. The value of `en` is `mid - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is a positive integer. Either (x * mid > a) or (y * mid > b) or both are true, `en` is `mid - 1`.
Output State: **`mid` is a positive integer. Either (x * mid > a) or (y * mid > b) or both are true, `en` is `mid - 1`**
