Example Answer:
The value of `mid` is calculated as the floor division of `(be + en + 1)` by 2. Since all variables are positive integers, the value of `mid` will be a positive integer as well. The loop continues with the same variables if the conditions `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b` are satisfied. Otherwise, `en` is updated to `mid - 1`. 
Output State: **`mid`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be` are positive integers. If conditions `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b` are met, the loop continues with the same variables. Otherwise, `en` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
