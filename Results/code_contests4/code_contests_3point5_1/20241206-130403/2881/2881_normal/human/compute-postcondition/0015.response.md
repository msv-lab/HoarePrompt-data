Example Answer:
`en` is updated to `mid - 1`, where `mid`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be` are positive integers. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be` are positive integers, `en` is `mid - 1`.
Output State: **`mid`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be` are positive integers, `en` is `mid - 1`**
