According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9 and `be` < `en`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `en` needs to be greater than `be`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a, b, x, and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9 and for the loop to execute the first time, `en` is greater than `be`**
