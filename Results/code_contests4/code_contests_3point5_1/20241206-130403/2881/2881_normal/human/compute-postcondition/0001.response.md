Example Answer:
The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `be`, `en`, and 1 by 2. The values of `be` and `en` are positive integers, and for the loop to execute the first time, `en` is greater than `be`. Therefore, the value of `mid` is a positive integer as well. 
Output State: **`mid` is a positive integer**
