According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if either x * mid is greater than a or y * mid is greater than b, en needs to be updated to mid - 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`mid` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `be`, `en` are positive integers. If both x * mid <= a and y * mid <= b, the program continues without any changes. If x * mid > a or y * mid > b, or both conditions are true, en is updated to mid - 1, for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`**
