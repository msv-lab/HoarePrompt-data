Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes the input of four integers a, b, x, and y.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y.
- It then reduces x and y by dividing them by their greatest common divisor.
- It calculates the minimum value between a // x and b // y.
- It prints the product of the minimum value with x and y, which represents the reduced size model.
- The `func_1` function calculates the maximum value of `mid` such that `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b` within the given range. It ensures that the total area of the reduced model is maximal.
- The code outputs the correct reduced screen parameters for the given input examples.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
