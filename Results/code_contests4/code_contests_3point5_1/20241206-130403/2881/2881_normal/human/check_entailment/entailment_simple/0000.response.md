Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum value of `mid` such that `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b` in order to maximize the total area of the reduced size model. This matches the requirements of the problem description, where the company wants to reduce the monitor size to have a screen sides ratio of x:y while maximizing the total area. The program prints the screen parameters of the reduced size model if it exists, and outputs 0 0 if such a reduction cannot be performed. The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
