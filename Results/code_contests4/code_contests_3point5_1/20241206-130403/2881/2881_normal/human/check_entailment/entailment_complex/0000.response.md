Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. It uses binary search to find the maximum value of `mid` such that `x * mid <= a` and `y * mid <= b`. This ensures that the screen parameters of the reduced size model have the desired screen sides ratio while maximizing the total area.

The program handles all potential cases as it iterates through the binary search loop to find the maximum valid `mid` value. It then prints the screen parameters of the reduced size model as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
