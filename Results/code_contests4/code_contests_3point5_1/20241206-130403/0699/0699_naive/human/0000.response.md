Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimal and maximal possible beauty for each test case. The main issues with the program are:
1. The program is using the `reduce` function without importing the `functools` module, which will result in a NameError.
2. The program is using `math.ceil` without importing the `math` module, which will result in a NameError.
3. The program is not performing the actual operations on the array to determine the minimal and maximal possible beauty.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
