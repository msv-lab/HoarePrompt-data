Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum and maximum beauty as described in the problem. The program calculates the maximum beauty correctly by summing up the ceiling values of all elements in the array divided by x. However, it calculates the minimum beauty incorrectly by dividing the sum of all elements in the array by x without considering any operations that can be performed to minimize the beauty.

The program should have included logic to calculate the minimum beauty by considering the possibility of performing operations to minimize the beauty. This is missing in the provided program, making it incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
