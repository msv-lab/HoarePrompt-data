Correctness: **False**

The program does not perform the required operations to determine the minimum and maximum possible beauty of the array. It simply calculates the sum of the array elements and the sum of the ceiling values of the array elements divided by x. The program does not actually perform the operations of replacing two adjacent elements by their sum in order to calculate the beauty of the array.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
