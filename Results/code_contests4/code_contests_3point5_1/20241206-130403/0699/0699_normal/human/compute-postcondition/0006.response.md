Example Answer:
`mx` is increased by the ceiling value of a[i] divided by x. The value of `i` is 1, so a[1] is being used in the calculation. Since the loop is supposed to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is converted to a float, `mx` is increased by the ceiling value of a[1] divided by x, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`x` is converted to a float, `mx` is increased by the ceiling value of a[1] divided by x, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
