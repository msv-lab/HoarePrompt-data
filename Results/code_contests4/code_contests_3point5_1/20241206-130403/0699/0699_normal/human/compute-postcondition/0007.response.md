According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is converted to a float, `mx` is increased by the ceiling value of a[1] divided by x, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`x` is converted to a float, `mx` is increased by the ceiling value of a[1] divided by x, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
