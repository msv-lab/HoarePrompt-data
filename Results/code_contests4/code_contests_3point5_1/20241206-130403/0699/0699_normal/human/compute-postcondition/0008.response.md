Example Answer:
`mx` is increased by the ceiling value of `a[1]` divided by `x`, where `i` is 2. The initial state states that `x` is converted to a float, `mx` is increased by the ceiling value of `a[1]` divided by `x`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. After execution, the value of `mx` increases by the ceiling value of `a[2]` divided by `x`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is converted to a float, `mx` is increased by the ceiling value of `a[2]` divided by `x`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2.
Output State: **`x` is converted to a float, `mx` is increased by the ceiling value of `a[2]` divided by `x`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
