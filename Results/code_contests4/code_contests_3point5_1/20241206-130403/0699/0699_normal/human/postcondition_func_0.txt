The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `a`. It converts `x` to a float, calculates the sum of elements in `a`, and then iterates over `n` elements in `a` to increment `mx` by the ceiling value of each element divided by `x`. Finally, it prints the integer division of the sum of `a` by `x` and the calculated `mx`. The function does not have a return value and simply prints the results.
