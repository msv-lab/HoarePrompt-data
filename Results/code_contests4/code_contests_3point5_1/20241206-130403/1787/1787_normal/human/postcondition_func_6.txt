The function `func_7` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It then performs a loop where `x` and `y` are updated based on certain conditions until `y` becomes falsy. Finally, the function returns the value of `x` after the loop has finished executing. The functionality of this function is to calculate and return the final value of `x` after the loop iterations based on the values of `x` and `y`.
