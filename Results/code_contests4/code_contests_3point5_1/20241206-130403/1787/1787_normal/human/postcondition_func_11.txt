The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It iterates `T` times, where `T` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`. Within each iteration, it reads an integer `n`, a list `Arr` using `func_6()` and `func_5() respectively`, and assigns the first element of `Arr` to `p`. Then, it checks if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` to set the flag. If any element in `Arr` differs from `p`, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not have explicit return values.
