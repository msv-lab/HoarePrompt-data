You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!

A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 ≤ i < n and a_{i} ≠ a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. 

For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.

Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the password.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the initial contents of your password.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Example

Input


2
4
2 1 3 1
2
420 420


Output


1
2

Note

In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of 1:

Pick i=2 to get [2, 4, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [6, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [7]

In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid i that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

    ifact = [0] * 100005
    ifact[100004] = pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(100004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing factorial values, `mod` is a constant, `i` is 0, `ifact` is a list of 100005 elements properly initialized, value of `ifact[0]` calculated as the inverse factorial of `fact[0]`, `ifact[i - 1]` is updated to `i * ifact[i] % mod`
    return fact, ifact
    #The program returns the list `fact` containing factorial values and the list `ifact` containing 100005 elements with updated values based on the calculations described

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
