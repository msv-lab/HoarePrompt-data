You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!

A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 ≤ i < n and a_{i} ≠ a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. 

For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.

Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the password.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the initial contents of your password.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Example

Input


2
4
2 1 3 1
2
420 420


Output


1
2

Note

In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of 1:

Pick i=2 to get [2, 4, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [6, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [7]

In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid i that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing the factorial values up to 100004 based on `mod`, `i` is 100004
    ifact = [0] * 100005
    ifact[100004] = pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(100004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing factorial values, `mod` is a constant, `i` is 0, `ifact` is a list of 100005 elements properly initialized, value of `ifact[0]` calculated as the inverse factorial of `fact[0]`, `ifact[i - 1]` is updated to `i * ifact[i] % mod`
    return fact, ifact
    #The program returns the list `fact` containing factorial values and the list `ifact` containing 100005 elements with updated values based on the calculations described
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns two lists: `fact` containing factorial values up to 100004 based on a certain modulus, and `ifact` containing 100005 elements with updated values calculated based on the factorial values. The function does not accept any parameters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the password, and p is a list of n positive integers representing the initial contents of the password.**

    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of raising n to the power of p-2 modulo p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the password, and `p`, a list of n positive integers representing the initial contents of the password. The function calculates the result of raising n to the power of p-2 modulo p.

    #The program returns the value of 't' which is dependent on the specific values of 'fact', 'ifact', 'n', 'r', and 'mod'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates the value of `t` based on the values of `fact`, `ifact`, `n`, `r`, and `mod`. The calculation involves multiplication and modulo operations. The function returns the calculated value of `t`. Missing functionality: The function does not handle any error cases or input validation, so it assumes the parameters are provided correctly and does not check for edge cases such as division by zero or invalid inputs.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input obtained from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, splits the input, and returns a map object containing integers. The function does not handle any exceptions that may occur during the input reading or splitting process.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers by mapping the input values from the standard input after stripping and splitting them
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values from the standard input, strips any whitespace, splits the values, maps them to integers, and returns a list of integers based on the mapped input values.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the input read from the standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads input from the standard input and returns it after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` and `y` hold the values after the loop has finished executing, with `x` and `y` being modified based on the calculations and conditions required for the loop to continue until `y` becomes falsy
    return x
    #The program returns the final value of variable `x` after the loop has finished executing
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It then performs a loop where `x` and `y` are updated based on certain conditions until `y` becomes falsy. Finally, the function returns the value of `x` after the loop has finished executing. The functionality of this function is to calculate and return the final value of `x` after the loop iterations based on the values of `x` and `y`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are variables. It then returns the result of multiplying `x` and `y`, and dividing that result by the return value of `func_7(x, y)`.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the password, and a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9.**
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
    #The program returns one of the following based on the value of n:
    #- n if n % 4 = 0
    #- 1 if n % 4 = 1
    #- n + 1 if n % 4 = 2
    #- 0 if n % 4 = 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the length of a password. It then returns a specific value based on the modulo operation of n with 4. If n % 4 = 0, it returns n; if n % 4 = 1, it returns 1; if n % 4 = 2, it returns n + 1; if n % 4 = 3, it returns 0. The function provides a deterministic output based on the value of n modulo 4.

        else:
            a = a * a
            a %= MOD
            b >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `b` is odd, `res` is the result of raising `a` to the power of the original value of `b`, and then finding the remainder when divided by `MOD`. If `b` is even, `res` remains an integer, `a` is the result of raising the original value of `a` to the power of `b/2`, and `b` becomes 0.
    res %= MOD
    return res
    #The program returns the result of raising 'a' to the power of the original value of 'b', finding the remainder when divided by 'MOD' if 'b' is odd. If 'b' is even, 'res' remains an integer, 'a' is the result of raising the original value of 'a' to the power of 'b/2', and 'b' becomes 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_10 accepts two integer parameters a and b. It calculates the result by raising 'a' to the power of the original value of 'b' and finding the remainder when divided by 'MOD' if 'b' is odd. If 'b' is even, it calculates 'res' by raising the original value of 'a' to the power of 'b/2', and 'b' eventually becomes 0. The function then returns the final value of 'res'.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_11(P):
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of 'ans' which is calculated based on the value of 'P'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_11 accepts a parameter P and calculates the value of 'ans' using a mathematical formula involving the square root function. It then returns this calculated value.

        n = int(func_6())
        
        Arr = func_5()
        
        p = Arr[0]
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in Arr[1:]:
            if i != p:
                flag = 1
                break
        
        if flag == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
        T -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: T is 0, n is the last integer value returned by func_6(), p is the first element of the list Arr, flag is 1 if at least one element in Arr is not equal to p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It iterates `T` times, where `T` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`. Within each iteration, it reads an integer `n`, a list `Arr` using `func_6()` and `func_5() respectively`, and assigns the first element of `Arr` to `p`. Then, it checks if any element in `Arr` is different from `p` to set the flag. If any element in `Arr` differs from `p`, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not have explicit return values.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
