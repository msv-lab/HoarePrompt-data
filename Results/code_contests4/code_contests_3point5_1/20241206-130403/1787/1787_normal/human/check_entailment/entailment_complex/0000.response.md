Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, the code accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The functions provided in the annotations are used to calculate factorial values, modular inverse, and perform necessary operations for the password length calculation. The main function `func_12` correctly reads the input, checks if all elements in the array are equal, and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description. The code handles the given test cases correctly and provides the expected output for each case. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the annotations that indicate the code would fail to follow the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
