Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not follow the problem description. The functions defined in the program do not relate to the problem of finding the shortest possible length of the password after applying a specific operation. The functions in the program are related to mathematical calculations, input/output handling, and number manipulation, which are not relevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
