Example Answer:
`Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The previous values of `T` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`.
Output State: **`T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`**
