Example Answer: 
`flag` is initialized to 0. The values of `T`, `n`, and `p` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`, `p` is the first element of the list `Arr`, `flag` is initialized to 0.
Output State: **`T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`, `p` is the first element of the list `Arr`, `flag` is initialized to 0**
