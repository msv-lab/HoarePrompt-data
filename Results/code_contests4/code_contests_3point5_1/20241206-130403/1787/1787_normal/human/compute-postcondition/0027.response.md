Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(func_6())`, where `func_6()` is a function call that returns a value. The value of `T` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`.
Output State: **`T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`**
