Postcondition: ***`T` is decremented by 2 times the number of elements in `Arr` after the loop finishes, `n` is assigned the last integer value returned by `func_6()`, `p` is the first element of the list `Arr`, `flag` is 1 if there is at least one element in `Arr` that is not equal to `p`, otherwise `flag` remains 0. The value of `flag` is 0.***
