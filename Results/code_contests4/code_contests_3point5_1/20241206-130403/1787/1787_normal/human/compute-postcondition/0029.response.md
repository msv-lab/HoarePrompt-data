Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `Arr`, which is `Arr[0]`. The values of `T` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`, `p` is the first element of the list `Arr`.
Output State: **`T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, `n` is assigned the integer value returned by `func_6()`, `p` is the first element of the list `Arr`**
