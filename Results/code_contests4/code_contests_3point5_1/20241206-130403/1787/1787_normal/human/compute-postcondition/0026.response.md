According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `T` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` needs to be decremented by 1 again so that it does not become 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`T` is decremented by 2 for the loop to execute again**
