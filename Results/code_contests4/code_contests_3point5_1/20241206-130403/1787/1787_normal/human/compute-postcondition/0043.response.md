Postcondition: ***`T` is decremented by 4, `n` is assigned a new integer value returned by `func_6()`, `p` is the first element of the list `Arr`, `flag` is set to 1, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in the list `Arr` after the previous iteration. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
