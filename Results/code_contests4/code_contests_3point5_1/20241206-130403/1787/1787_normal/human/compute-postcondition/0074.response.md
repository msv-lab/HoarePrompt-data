Postcondition: ***T will be decremented by the total number of elements in Arr that are not equal to p, n will be assigned the last integer value returned by func_6(), p will remain the first element of the list Arr, flag will be 1 if at least one element in Arr is not equal to p, for the loop to execute again T must be greater than 0, Arr will be assigned the return value of func_5(). Additionally, if flag is 1, the same operations will be performed. If flag is not 1, n will be printed, which is the last integer value returned by func_6().***
