Example Answer:
`T` is assigned the value `int(func_6())`, where `func_6()` is a function call that returns a value which is then converted to an integer. The specific value returned by `func_6()` is unknown, so the output state is: `T` is an integer value returned by `func_6()`.
Output State: **`T` is an integer value returned by `func_6()`**
