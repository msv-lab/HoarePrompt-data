Postcondition: ***T is decremented by 1, n is assigned the last integer value returned by func_6(), p is the first element of the list Arr, flag is 1, for the loop to execute again T is greater than 0, Arr is assigned the return value of func_5(), i is the next element in the list Arr after the current value of i, i is not equal to p, and if i is not equal to p, flag is 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
