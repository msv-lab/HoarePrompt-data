The function func_10 accepts two integer parameters a and b. It calculates the result by raising 'a' to the power of the original value of 'b' and finding the remainder when divided by 'MOD' if 'b' is odd. If 'b' is even, it calculates 'res' by raising the original value of 'a' to the power of 'b/2', and 'b' eventually becomes 0. The function then returns the final value of 'res'.
