**Precondition:**

- The input consists of multiple test cases.
- Each test case begins with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), the length of the password.
- The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), representing the initial contents of the password.
- The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
