Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input for the number of test cases, the length of the password, and the initial contents of the password.
2. It then iterates through each test case, checks if there are adjacent numbers that are not equal, and if so, prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the length of the password.
3. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for each test case based on the given conditions.
4. There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected, so the correctness is true.
