Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the number of test cases, the length of the password, and the initial contents of the password as input. It then iterates through each test case and checks if there is at least one pair of adjacent numbers that are not equal. If such a pair exists, it prints 1 as the shortest possible length of the password as one operation can be applied. If all the numbers in the array are equal, it prints the length of the password as the shortest possible length.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and correctly determines the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.
