Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not generate a permutation where there is no index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that p_i = i. The output hints specify that the code should print n distinct integers in a specific pattern, but the code does not adhere to this pattern for all test cases. For example, when the input is 5, the code prints "5 4 3 2 1" which violates the condition that p_i ≠ i for all i from 1 to n. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
