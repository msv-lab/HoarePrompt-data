Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program reads an integer 'a' and then reads 'a' number of integers 'b'. For each 'b', it prints a string representation of 'b' with descending numbers from 'b' to 1 separated by spaces. This does not satisfy the condition of finding a permutation p of length n where there is no index i such that p_i = i. The program does not generate permutations that meet the specified conditions in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
