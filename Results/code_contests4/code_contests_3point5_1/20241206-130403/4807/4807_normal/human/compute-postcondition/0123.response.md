Output State: **The value of `g` is printed, reflecting the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number. For the loop to execute again `i` is incremented by 1 and `a` is adjusted accordingly so that `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer. `s` is assigned the value of `b`.**
