According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer greater than 1. Since `a` is greater than 1, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is 0, `g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than or equal to 2**
