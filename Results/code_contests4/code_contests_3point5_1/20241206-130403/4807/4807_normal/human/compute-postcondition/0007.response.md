Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is converted to a string and concatenated to the current value of `g`. Since `g` is initially an empty string and `b` is an input integer, `g` will now hold the string representation of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is a string containing the string representation of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is assigned the value of `b`, `g` is a string containing the string representation of `b`**
