Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is greater than 1, so after execution, `a` will hold the input value as an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer**
