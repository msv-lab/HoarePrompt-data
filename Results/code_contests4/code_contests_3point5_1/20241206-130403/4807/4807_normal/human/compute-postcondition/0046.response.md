Example Answer:
The code attempts to concatenate the value of `g` with the string representation of `s`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `g` or `s`, so the final output state will depend on their initial values. As `g` remains unchanged, the final output state is: `g` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`g` remains unchanged**
