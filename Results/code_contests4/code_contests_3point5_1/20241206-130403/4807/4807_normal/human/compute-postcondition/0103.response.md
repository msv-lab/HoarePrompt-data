Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is either -2 or the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, a space, an additional space character, and the string representation of -1 for the loop to execute again with -1 appended to the current value of `g`. After the execution of the if else block, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition with no changes.***
