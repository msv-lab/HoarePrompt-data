Example Answer:
`s` is updated to be `s - 2`, where `s` is greater than 1. Therefore, after execution, `s` is decreased by 2. The other variables remain the same. Also, `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s` and a space character is added to the end. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s - 1` is greater than 0, `b` is an odd integer, `s` is decreased by 2, `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s` and a space character is added to the end**
