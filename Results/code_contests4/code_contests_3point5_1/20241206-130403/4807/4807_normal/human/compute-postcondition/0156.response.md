Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is decreased by 3, so it becomes -2. Then, `s - 1` is calculated, resulting in -3. This value is converted to a string and added to the existing value of `g`. Therefore, `g` is updated with the string representation of the updated `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3.
Output State: **`g` is updated with the string representation of the updated `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3, `s` is -2, `b` is 1**
