Example Answer:
The value of `s` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so the new value of `s` will depend on the initial value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `g` is updated with the new concatenated value, `s` is decremented by 2.
Output State: **`g` is updated with the new concatenated value, `s` is decremented by 2**
