Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by appending a space to its current value. The loop will continue based on conditions, and eventually, the final output will include `g` with the string representation of `s - 1` along with spaces added in each iteration. The value of `b` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `g` is updated with the string representation of `s - 1` with spaces added, `b` remains as 1.
Output State: **`g` is updated with the string representation of `s - 1` with spaces added, `b` is 1**
