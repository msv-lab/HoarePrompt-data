Example Answer: 
`s` is decremented by 1. The value of `s` is not provided, so the new value of `s` cannot be determined. Since `g` remains unchanged and the loop conditions are not affected, the Output State is: `g` remains unchanged, loop conditions remain the same.
Output State: **`g` remains unchanged, loop conditions remain the same**
