Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer**
