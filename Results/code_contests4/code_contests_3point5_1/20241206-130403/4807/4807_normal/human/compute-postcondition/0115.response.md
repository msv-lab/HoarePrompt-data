Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s - 1` is greater than 0, `b` is an odd integer. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, then `s` is decreased by 2 and `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s` with a space character added to the end. After the execution of the if statement where `s == 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
