Postcondition: ***`g` is updated with the string representation of the updated `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3, -2; `s` is decreased by 4, `b` is 1. This happens when `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` is 0, then the program fragment executes the if part and updates the variables as described above.***
