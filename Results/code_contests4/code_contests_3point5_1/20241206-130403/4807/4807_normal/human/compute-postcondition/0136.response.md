Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by adding a space at the end. The updated value of `g` will now reflect the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number. Since the loop needs to execute again, `s - 1` should be greater than 1 and `b` should be an even number. 
Output State: **The updated value of `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, for the loop to execute again `s - 1` is greater than 1 and `b` is an even number**
