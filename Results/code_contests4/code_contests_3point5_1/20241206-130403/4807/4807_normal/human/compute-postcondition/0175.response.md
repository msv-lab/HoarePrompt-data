Example Answer:
`g` is updated with an extra space at the end. The previous value of `g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3, -2, and ' ', the value of `s` decreased by 4, and `g` updated with an extra space at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3, -2, and ' ', the value of `s` decreased by 4, `g` updated with an extra space at the end, and `g` updated with the string representation of `s` followed by an extra space.
Output State: **`g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3, -2, and ' ', the value of `s` decreased by 4, `g` updated with an extra space at the end, and `g` updated with the string representation of `s` followed by an extra space**
