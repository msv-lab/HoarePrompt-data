Example Answer:
`g` is appended with a space. The previous value of `g` contains the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is greater than 1, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number and a space.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is greater than 1, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number and a space**
