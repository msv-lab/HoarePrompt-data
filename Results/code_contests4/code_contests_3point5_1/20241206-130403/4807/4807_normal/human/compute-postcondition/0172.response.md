Postcondition: ***`g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3, -2, and ' ', along with the value of `s` decreased by 1. The loop will execute again if `s - 1` is greater than 0 and `b % 2` is 1. Additionally, `g` is updated with an extra space at the end and the value of `s` is decreased by 1. The value of `g` is updated with the string representation of `s`. `s` is further decreased by 2.***
