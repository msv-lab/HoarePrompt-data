Example Answer:
`s` is decremented by 1, where the previous value of `s` is two less than its previous value. Therefore, the new value of `s` is now three less than its previous value. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is three less than its previous value, `g` is a string containing the string representation of `b` followed by a space and the value of `s`**
