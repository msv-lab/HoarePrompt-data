Example Answer:
`g` is appended with a space character. The previous value of `g` contains the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number and a space. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, a space, and then an additional space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is decremented by 1, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, a space, and an additional space character**
