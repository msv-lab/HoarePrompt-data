Postcondition: ***`g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, -3, -2, and ' ', the value of `s` decreased by 4, `g` updated with an extra space at the end, and `g` updated with the string representation of `s`. The loop will execute again if `s - 1` is greater than 0 and `b % 2` is 1.***
