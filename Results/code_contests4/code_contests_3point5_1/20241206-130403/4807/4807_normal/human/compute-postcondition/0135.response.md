Example Answer: 
`s` is decremented by 1. The loop will execute again only if `s - 1` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The updated value of `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, for the loop to execute again `s - 1` is greater than 1 and `b` is an even number.
