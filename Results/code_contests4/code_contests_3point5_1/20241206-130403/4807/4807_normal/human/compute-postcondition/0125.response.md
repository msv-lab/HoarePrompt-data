Example Answer:
`g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `b` to it. The value of `b` is unknown at this point so `g` will reflect this updated value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `g` is printed, reflecting the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number. For the loop to execute again `i` is incremented by 1 and `a` is adjusted accordingly so that `i` is less than `a`. `b` remains an input integer. `s` is assigned the value of `b`.
