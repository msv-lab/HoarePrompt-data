Example Answer:
`g` is updated by concatenating `s` as a string to the existing value of `g`. Since `s` is equal to `b - 1` and `b` is an even input integer, the updated value of `g` will contain the numbers from `b - 1` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is equal to the updated value of `b` - 1, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is equal to the updated value of `b` - 1, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number**
