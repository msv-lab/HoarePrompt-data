Postcondition: ***`g` is printed, reflecting the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number. For the loop to execute the first time, `s - 1` must be greater than 0 and `b` must be an odd number, `s` is decreased by 1. Additionally, when the `if` condition `(s == b // 2 + 1)` is true, the loop will terminate and the final output will have `g` reflecting the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number.***
