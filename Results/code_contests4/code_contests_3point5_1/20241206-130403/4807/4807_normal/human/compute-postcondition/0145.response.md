Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to it. Additionally, spaces are added between the original value of `g` and `s`. Since `g` is already updated with the string representation of `s - 1` with spaces added, the updated value of `g` will include the existing value of `g`, a space, and the string representation of `s`. The value of `b` remains as 1. 
Output State: **`g` is updated with the string representation of `s - 1` with spaces added, concatenated with the string representation of `s`; `b` is 1**
