Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value of `g` concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`. The value of `s` is not provided, so the output state will depend on the value of `s` which is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `g` is 'hello ' concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`.
Output State: **`g` is 'hello ' concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`**
