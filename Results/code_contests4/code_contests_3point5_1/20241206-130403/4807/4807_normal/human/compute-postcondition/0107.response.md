Example Answer:
`s` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `s` is `s - 1`. The loop can execute again as long as `s - 1` is greater than 0 and `b` is an odd integer. The value of `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s - 1` is greater than 0, `b` is an odd integer, `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s - 1` is greater than 0, `b` is an odd integer, `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s`**
