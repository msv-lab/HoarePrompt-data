Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value of `g` with a space added at the end. The previous value of `g` is known to have a space at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is adjusted to meet the condition for loop execution - 1, `g` has an additional space at the end.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is adjusted to meet the condition for loop execution - 1, `g` has an additional space at the end**
