Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the current value of `g` with the string representation of `s - 1`. The value of `s` is 0, so `s - 1` is -1. Therefore, the new value of `g` will have "-1" appended to the current value of `g`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is 0, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, a space, an additional space character, and the string representation of -1 for the loop to execute again with -1 appended to the current value of `g`**
