Example Answer:
The value of `s` is decremented by 2, so the updated value of `s` is -1. `g` is then updated by appending the string representation of `s` (-1) to the existing value of `g`. The output state reflects the updated values of `s` and `g`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is 0, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number, a space, an additional space character, and the string representation of -1.**
