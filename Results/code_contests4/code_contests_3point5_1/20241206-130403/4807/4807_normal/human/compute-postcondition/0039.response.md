Example Answer:
`g` is concatenated with a space. Since `g` already has an additional space at the end and is concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`, the output state will have `g` with two additional spaces at the end.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input odd integer, `s` is adjusted to meet the condition for loop execution - 1, `g` has two additional spaces at the end, `g` is concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`.**
