Example Answer:
The value of `g` is concatenated with a space. Since `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number and a space, adding a space at the end reflects the same pattern with an extra space. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is greater than 0, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number and a space, for the loop to execute one more time `s` needs to be adjusted to `s - 2 > 0` and `b` needs to be an even integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is greater than 0, `g` reflects the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from the updated value of `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number and a space, for the loop to execute one more time `s` needs to be adjusted to `s - 2 > 0` and `b` needs to be an even integer.**
