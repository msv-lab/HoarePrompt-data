Example Answer:
The string `g` is concatenated with the string representation of `s`. As `s` is one less than its previous value, the new value of `s` is `s - 1`. The output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is one less than its previous value, `g` is a string containing the string representation of `b` followed by a space and the value of `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is one less than its previous value, `g` is a string containing the string representation of `b` followed by a space and the value of `s`**
