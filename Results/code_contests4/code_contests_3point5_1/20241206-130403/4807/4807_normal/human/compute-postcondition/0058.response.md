Example Answer:
The variable `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of variable `s` at the end along with a space. The previous state of `g` is a string with a space concatenated at the end. After execution, the new value of `g` will be the previous value of `g` with the string representation of `s` and a space concatenated at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `g` is updated with the previous value of `g` along with the string representation of `s` and a space concatenated at the end.
Output State: **`g` is updated with the previous value of `g` along with the string representation of `s` and a space concatenated at the end**
