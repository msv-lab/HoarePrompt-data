Output State: **The updated value of `g` is printed, reflecting the updated value of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number. For the loop to execute again `s` is equal to `b - 3`, `b` is greater than 1 and even, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a` is adjusted so that `i` is less than `a`, `g` has a space added to it**
