Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `i`, `b` are integers. `n` is greater than 1, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is an odd integer. If `s` is 0, then the program sets `i` to 0, adjusts `s` to meet the condition for loop execution - 3, and concatenates `g` with the string representation of `s` if `s` equals `b // 2 + 1.***
