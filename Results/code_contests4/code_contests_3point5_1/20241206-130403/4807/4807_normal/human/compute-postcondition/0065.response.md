Example Answer:
After executing the code `g = ''`, the variable `g` is assigned an empty string. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is equal to `b`, `g` is an empty string, `g` contains the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order with spaces between each number.
