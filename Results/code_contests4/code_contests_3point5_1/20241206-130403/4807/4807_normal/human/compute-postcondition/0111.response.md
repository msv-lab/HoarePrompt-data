Example Answer:
The value of `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s`. Since `s` is 1 greater than its previous value and a space character is added to the end, `g` will contain the updated string representation of `s` followed by a space. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s - 1` is greater than 0, `b` is an odd integer, `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s` and a space character is added to the end.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an input odd integer, `s - 1` is greater than 0, `b` is an odd integer, `g` is updated with the new string representation of the updated `s` and a space character is added to the end**
