Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input even integer, `s` is adjusted to meet the condition for loop execution - 2, `g` is a string containing the string representation of `b` followed by spaces and the numbers from `b` to 1 in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, then the function adjusts `s` to meet the condition for loop execution - 2, and `g` is updated by adding the string representation of `s`. Additionally, `s` is equal to 0***
