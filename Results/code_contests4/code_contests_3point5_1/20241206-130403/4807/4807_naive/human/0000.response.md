Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not produce the expected output for all test cases. For example, when the input is 2, the output should be "2 1" (a permutation where p_i â‰  i for all i from 1 to n), but the program does not handle this case correctly and provides a different output. This inconsistency shows that the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
