Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The program correctly reads the input values for $n$, $k$, and $w_i$ and calculates the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor. It uses binary search to find the minimum value of $P$ efficiently by checking if the number of trucks required to load all packages is less than or equal to $k$. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples.
