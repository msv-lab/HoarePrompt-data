Example Answer:
The value of `loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, where `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. The previous values of `loadings` and `i` are not provided, so the output state is: loadings is increased by the value of w[i], i is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again i is less than n.
Output State: **loadings is increased by the value of w[i], i is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again i is less than n**
