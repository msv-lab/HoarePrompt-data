Postcondition: ***Output State: `w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is 2, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 2, `loadings` has been updated with the value of `w[i]`. If `middle` is less than `loadings`, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, `loadings` is equal to `w[i]` and `loadings` is incremented by `w[i]`.***
