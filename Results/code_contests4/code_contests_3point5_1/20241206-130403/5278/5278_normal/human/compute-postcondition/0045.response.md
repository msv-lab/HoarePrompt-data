According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` contains all the values of `num` appended in each iteration, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is 2, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration, `minP` is 0, 1 is not equal to `k`, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, `right` is 1,000,000,000, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `loadings` is the sum of all previous values of `w` up to index `i`. Additionally, if `middle` is less than `loadings`, then `truckCnt` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, then all variables retain their initial values as the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement, and `loadings` is assigned the value `w[i]`.**
