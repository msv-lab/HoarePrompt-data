Output State: **`w` contains all the values of `num` appended in each iteration, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is less than `n-1`, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration, `minP` is 0, 1 is not equal to `k`, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, `right` is 1,000,000,000, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `loadings` is the sum of all previous values of `w` up to index `i`. Additionally, `middle` is less than `loadings`. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, all variables retain their initial values as the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement, `loadings` is assigned the value `w[i]`.**
