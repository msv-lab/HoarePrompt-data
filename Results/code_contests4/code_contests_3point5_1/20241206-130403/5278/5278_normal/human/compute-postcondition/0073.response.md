According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is not equal to `k`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be less than `n`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is less than `n`, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is 0, `loadings` is 0, `middle` is updated to the value of `(left + right) // 2`**
