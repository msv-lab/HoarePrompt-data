Postcondition: ***`w` contains the appended value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is three times the value of `num`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2. If maxW is less than num, then maxW is updated to num, and the other variables remain unchanged.***
