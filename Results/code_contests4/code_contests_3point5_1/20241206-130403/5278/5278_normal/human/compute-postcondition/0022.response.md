Output State: **`w` contains all the values of `num` appended in each iteration, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the total number of iterations, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration. If `n` is 0, then `maxW` remains 0, `sumW` remains 0, and `w` remains empty.**
