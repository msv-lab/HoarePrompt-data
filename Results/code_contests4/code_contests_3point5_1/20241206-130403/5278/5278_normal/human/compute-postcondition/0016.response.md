According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `w` contains the appended value of `num`
- `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`
- `sumW` is twice the value of `num`
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `num` is an integer input

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `w` contains the appended value of `num`
- `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`
- `sumW` is twice the value of `num`
- `i` is 2 (increased by 1 for the next iteration)
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time
- `num` is an integer input

State: **`w` contains the appended value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is twice the value of `num`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2, and `num` is an integer input**
