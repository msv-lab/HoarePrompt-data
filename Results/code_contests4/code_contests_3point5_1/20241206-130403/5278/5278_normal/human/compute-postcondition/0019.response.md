Example Answer: 
After executing the given code, the value of `num` is appended to the list `w`. As the value of `num` is unknown, the list `w` now contains the appended value of `num`. The values of `maxW`, `sumW`, and `i` remain the same as they are not affected by the code. The loop will still execute the second time as `n` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` contains the appended value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is three times the value of `num`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.
Output State: **`w` contains the appended value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is three times the value of `num`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
