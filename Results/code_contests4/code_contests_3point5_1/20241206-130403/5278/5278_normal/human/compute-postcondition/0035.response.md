According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. 

Right before the loop, `i` is equal to `n-1`. Since `i` needs to be less than `n` for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be adjusted to a value less than `n-1`. Additionally, if `n` is not equal to `k`, then `n` should be adjusted to be not equal to `k` for the loop to execute. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`w` contains all the values of `num` appended in each iteration, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is less than `n-1`, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration, `minP` is 0, 1 is not equal to `k`, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, `right` is 1,000,000,000, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `loadings` is 0**.
