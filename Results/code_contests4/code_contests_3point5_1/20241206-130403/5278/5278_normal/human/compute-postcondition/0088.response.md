Example Answer: 
The value of `loadings` is assigned as `w[i]`. The value of `truckCnt` is not affected by this code snippet. If `k` is less than `truckCnt` + 1, `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `truckCnt` is either increased by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `loadings` is assigned `w[i]`.
Output State: **`truckCnt` is either increased by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `loadings` is assigned `w[i]`**
