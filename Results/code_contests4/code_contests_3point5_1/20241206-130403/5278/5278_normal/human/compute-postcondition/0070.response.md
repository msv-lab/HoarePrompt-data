According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is equal to `middle + 1` and `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to update `left` to be less than or equal to the updated `right` value.
State: **`w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` contains the count of trucks required to carry the loadings, `loadings` is the sum of all values of `w`, `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `left` should be less than or equal to the updated value of `right`**
