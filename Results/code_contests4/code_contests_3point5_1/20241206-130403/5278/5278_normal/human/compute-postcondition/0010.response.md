According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` contains the value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 as `i` will be increased by 1.
State: **`w` contains the value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is the value of `num`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
