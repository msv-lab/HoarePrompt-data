According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, and `right` is 1,000,000,000. Since `left` is already less than or equal to `right`, the loop can certainly execute one more time.
State: **`w` contains all the values of `num` appended in each iteration, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration, `minP` is 0, 1 is not equal to k, n is not equal to k, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, `right` is 1,000,000,000**
