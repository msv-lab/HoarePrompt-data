Postcondition: ***`w` contains the appended value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is twice the value of `num`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, and `num` is an integer input. If `maxW` < `num`, then `w` contains the appended value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the value of `num`, `sumW` is twice the value of `num`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, and `num` is an integer input.***
