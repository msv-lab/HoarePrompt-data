Output State: **`w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` contains the number of trucks needed to carry the load, `loadings` is the total weight loaded onto the trucks, `i` is equal to `n`, `middle` is updated to the value of `(left + right) // 2`, `i` is equal to `n`, if the number of trucks plus 1 is less than or equal to `k`, `minP` is updated to be equal to `middle`, and `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`**
