Postcondition: ***Output State: `w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `minP` is updated to be equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is the number of times `middle < loadings` was true, `loadings` is the last value of `w` that caused `middle < loadings` to be true, and if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1, `minP` is updated to be equal to `middle`. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `truckCnt + 1`, `right` is updated to `middle - 1`. The condition `(truckCnt + 1 <= k)` holds true after the execution of the if else block. Additionally, after the if condition `(k < truckCnt + 1)` is true, `k < truckCnt + 1` is also true in the overall state of the program.***
