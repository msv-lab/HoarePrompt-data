Example Answer: 
The value of `num` is appended to the list `w`. The value of `num` is already assigned to `sumW`, so after appending `num` to `w`, the list `w` will contain `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` contains the value of `num`, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is the value of `num`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input.
Output State: **`w` contains the value of `num`, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is the value of `num`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input**
