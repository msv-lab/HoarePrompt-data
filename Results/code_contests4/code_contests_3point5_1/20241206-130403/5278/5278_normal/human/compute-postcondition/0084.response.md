Example Answer:
The value of `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`, where `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. The previous values of `loadings` and `w` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: loadings is increased by the value of w[i] and i is incremented by 1.
Output State: **loadings is increased by the value of w[i] and i is incremented by 1**
