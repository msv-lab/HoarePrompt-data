Postcondition: ***At the end of the execution, `w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `minP` contains the final value calculated in the loop, `k` remains not equal to 1, `n` remains not equal to `k`, `left` is updated to the final value after the loop, `right` is updated to the final value after the loop, `middle` contains the final value calculated in the loop, `truckCnt` contains the final count of trucks required, and `loadings` contains the final sum of all values of `w`. If 1 is equal to `k`, the program state remains the same as the precondition.***
