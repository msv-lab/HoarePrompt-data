Example Answer:
The value of `loadings` is incremented by `w[i]`. The previous values of the variables are known, so `loadings` is updated to its current value plus the value of `w[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is 0, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is 0. 
Output State: **`w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is 0, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is 0, `loadings` has been updated with the value of `w[i]`.**
