Example Answer:
The value of `sumW` is incremented by the value of `num`. Since `sumW` was initially equal to `num`, after executing the code, `sumW` will be twice the value of `num`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` contains the value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is twice the value of `num`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `num` is an integer input.
Output State: **`w` contains the value of `num`, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the initial `maxW` and `num`, `sumW` is twice the value of `num`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `num` is an integer input**
