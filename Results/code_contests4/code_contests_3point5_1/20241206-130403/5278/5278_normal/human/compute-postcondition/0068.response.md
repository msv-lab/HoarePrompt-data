Example Answer: 
The value of `right` is updated to be `middle - 1`. Since `middle` was calculated as `(left + right) // 2`, the new value of `right` is `(left + right) // 2 - 1`. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is equal to `n`, `num` is an integer value obtained from user input in each iteration, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` contains the count of trucks required to carry the loadings, `loadings` is the sum of all values of `w`, `i` is equal to `n`. If `(truckCnt + 1 <= k)`, then the program updates `minP` to `middle`. Additionally, `k` is not less than `truckCnt + 1`.
