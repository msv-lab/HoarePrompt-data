Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Since the loop is expected to execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`, the loop will continue to run with the updated value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: loadings is increased by the value of w[i] where i is now updated; for the loop to execute again, i should be less than n.
Output State: **loadings is increased by the value of w[i] where i is now updated; for the loop to execute again, i should be less than n**
