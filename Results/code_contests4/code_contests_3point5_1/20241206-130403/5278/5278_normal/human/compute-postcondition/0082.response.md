Output State: **`w` contains all the values of `num`, `maxW` is the maximum value of all `num` inputs, `sumW` is the sum of all `num` inputs, `i` is incremented by 1, `minP` is equal to `middle`, `k` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to `k`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1`, `right` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 - 1`, `middle` is the result of the calculation `(left + right) // 2`, `truckCnt` is incremented by 1, `loadings` is the sum of `w` values up to index `i`, `middle` is updated to the value of `(left + right) // 2`, and `middle` is less than `loadings`. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i`]**
