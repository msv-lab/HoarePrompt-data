The function takes input values for `n` and `k`, and then calculates the maximum total weight that can be carried by a team of k people based on the weights each person can carry. It does this by iteratively updating the minimum possible weight that can be carried until it finds the optimal weight that satisfies the conditions. The function considers various scenarios based on the values of `n` and `k`, such as when `k` is equal to 1 or when `n` is equal to `k`. It uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum weight. Additionally, it handles cases where the input constraints are violated.
