Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n` and `k` and then calculates the maximum total weight that can be carried by a team of `k` trucks based on the weights of the packages.
- It considers different scenarios based on the values of `n` and `k`, such as when `k` is equal to 1 or when `n` is equal to `k`.
- The code efficiently uses binary search to find the minimum weight that satisfies the conditions.
- It handles cases where the inputs violate the constraints specified in the problem description.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is following the problem description correctly.
