Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor. It considers different scenarios based on the values of $n$ and $k, such as when $k$ is equal to 1 or when $n$ is equal to $k. It uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum weight and handles cases where the input constraints are violated.

The program ensures that each truck can load consecutive packages as long as the total weights of the packages in the sequence do not exceed the maximum load $P$. It iteratively updates the minimum possible weight that can be carried until it finds the optimal weight that satisfies the conditions. Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
