Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values of $n$, $k$ and $w_i$ correctly. It then calculates the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ required to load all packages onto the trucks. The program uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum value of $P$ that satisfies the conditions given in the problem description. It iteratively checks if the current middle value of $P$ allows for the loading of all packages onto the trucks within the given constraints.

The program correctly handles all possible cases including when $k = 1$, when $n = k$, and when $n \neq k$. It also correctly handles the edge cases of the minimum and maximum values of $w_i$.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
