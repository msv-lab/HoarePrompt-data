Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for $n$, $k$, and $w_i$.
2. It correctly calculates the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor.
3. The program uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum value of $P$.
4. It handles the cases where $k=1$, $n=k$, and other general cases where the packages need to be loaded onto multiple trucks.
5. The logic for checking if the total weight of packages exceeds the maximum load $P$ is correctly implemented within the binary search loop.
6. The program iterates through all potential cases and finds the correct minimum value of $P$ to load all packages onto $k$ trucks.
