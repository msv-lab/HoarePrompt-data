You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given $n$ packages of $w_i$ kg from a belt conveyor in order ($i = 0, 1, ... n-1$). You should load all packages onto $k$ trucks which have the common maximum load $P$. Each truck can load consecutive packages (more than or equals to zero) from the belt conveyor unless the total weights of the packages in the sequence does not exceed the maximum load $P$.

Write a program which reads $n$, $k$ and $w_i$, and reports the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ to load all packages from the belt conveyor.

Constraints

* $1 \leq n \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq k \leq 100,000$
* $1 \leq w_i \leq 10,000$

Input

In the first line, two integers $n$ and $k$ are given separated by a space character. In the following $n$ lines, $w_i$ are given respectively.

Output

Print the minimum value of $P$ in a line.

Program:
```
(n, k) = [int(val) for val in raw_input().split(' ')]
w = []
maxW = sumW = 0
for i in range(n):
    num = int(raw_input())
    sumW += num
    w.append(num)
    if maxW < num:
        maxW = num
minP = 0
if 1 == k:
    minP = sumW
elif n == k:
    minP = maxW
else:
    left = maxW
    right = 100000 * 10000
    while left <= right:
        middle = (left + right) // 2
        truckCnt = i = loadings = 0
        while i < n:
            loadings += w[i]
            if middle < loadings:
                truckCnt += 1
                if k < truckCnt + 1:
                    break
                loadings = w[i]
            i += 1
        if truckCnt + 1 <= k:
            minP = middle
        if k < truckCnt + 1:
            left = middle + 1
        else:
            right = middle - 1
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
