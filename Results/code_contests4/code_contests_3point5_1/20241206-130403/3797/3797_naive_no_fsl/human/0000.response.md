Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes input for the number of queries, the values of a and b for each query, and the string s. 
- It then iterates through each query and checks if Alice can win by replacing '.' with 'X' in the string based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description. 
- The program correctly implements the logic of selecting substrings of appropriate lengths for Alice and Bob and determines the winner based on the number of moves made.
- The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
- The code structure is well-organized, and the functions are appropriately defined for different purposes.
