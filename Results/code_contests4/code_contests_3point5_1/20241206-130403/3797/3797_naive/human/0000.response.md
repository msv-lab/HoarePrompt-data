Correctness: **False**

In the given code, the function `func_1()` is intended to determine if Alice can win the game based on the provided string and conditions. However, there are some issues in the implementation that might lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

One potential issue is the usage of the `cnt` variable to keep track of the number of moves made. This might not accurately reflect the progress of the game as it only checks the parity of the count to determine the winner. This can lead to incorrect outcomes in scenarios where the number of moves made by Alice and Bob do not follow a simple parity pattern.

Additionally, the implementation of the conditions for Alice's and Bob's moves might not cover all possible scenarios accurately. The conditions involving the length of the substring selected by Alice and Bob (`a` and `b`) may not handle all edge cases correctly, leading to incorrect determinations of the game outcome.

Overall, the code may not be handling all possible game scenarios correctly, which can result in incorrect determinations of the winner.
