The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` of tuples and two integers `start` and `end`. It then returns a range starting from position `start` up to the length of list `l` plus `end`. The function does not consider the contents of the tuples within the list `l`, it solely operates based on the length of the list and the provided `start` and `end` values.
