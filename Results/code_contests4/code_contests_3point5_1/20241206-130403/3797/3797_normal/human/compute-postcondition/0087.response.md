Postcondition: ***Output is 0, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the first element of `s`. If the first element of `s` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, `cnt` is increased by 1. If the first element of `s` is not 'X' or less than or equal to 0, if the first element of `s` is '.', `this` is 1.***
