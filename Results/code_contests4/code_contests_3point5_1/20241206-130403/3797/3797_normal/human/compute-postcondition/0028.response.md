According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `s` and the values of `c` and `this`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states were present:
- `a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag` are assigned values returned by func_3()
- `s` is a list containing at least 1 element with 'X' appended
- `cnt` is incremented by 1
- `this` is assigned the value 0
- `flag` remains True
- for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first element in `s`
- when the condition (c == 'X' and this > 0) is true, then `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0
- after entering the if condition (2 * b <= this), `this` is at least twice the value of `b`
- after entering the if condition (this < a), `this` is less than `a`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next iteration:
- If the condition (c == 'X' and this > 0) is true, then `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, so `this` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the next iteration.
- If the condition (c == 'X' and this > 0) is false, then `a` and `b` are assigned values returned by func_3(), so `a` and `b` need to be adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.
- `s` is a list containing at least 1 element with 'X' appended, so `s` remains the same.
- `cnt` is initialized to 0, so `cnt` needs to be adjusted to be 0 for the next iteration.
- `this` is assigned the value 1 if the condition is false, so `this` needs to be adjusted to be 1 for the next iteration.
- `flag` is assigned the boolean value False if the condition is false, so `flag` remains False.
- `c` is the first element in `s`, so `c` remains the same or changes depending on the next element in `s`.

State: **`a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag` are assigned values returned by func_3(); `s` is a list containing at least 1 element with 'X' appended; `cnt` is 0; `this` is 1; `flag` is False; `c` is the next element in `s` or '.'**
