Postcondition: ***`s` is a list from input with an additional 'X' element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `this` is greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input value is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the return values of `func_3()`, `flag` is False. The condition is met where `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0. Additionally, if `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this`, then a `raise` statement is encountered causing an exception to be raised and the program to terminate abruptly. After entering the if condition where `(2 * b <= this)` and `flag` is True, the overall state of the program is maintained.***
