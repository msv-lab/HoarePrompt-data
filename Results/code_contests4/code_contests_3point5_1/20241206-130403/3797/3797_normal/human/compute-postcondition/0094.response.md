Example Answer: 
The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception and terminate the program abruptly. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program terminates with an unhandled exception. Therefore, the Output State is: Output is 0, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the next element of `s` based on the current iteration, `this`, `cnt` remain unchanged. The program terminated with an unhandled exception raised.
Output State: **Output is 0, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the next element of `s` based on the current iteration, `this`, `cnt` remain unchanged. The program terminated with an unhandled exception raised.**
