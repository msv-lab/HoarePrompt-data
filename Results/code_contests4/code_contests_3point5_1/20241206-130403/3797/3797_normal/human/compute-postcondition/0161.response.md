Postcondition: ***`s` has more elements with `c` being the next element in `s`, `this` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the condition is met, the input value is still greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the return values of `func_3()`, `flag` remains True if the condition is met. If c == 'X' and this > 0, the program raises an exception and stops execution. If c != 'X' or this <= 0, `this` is either incremented by 1 if c == '.'.***
