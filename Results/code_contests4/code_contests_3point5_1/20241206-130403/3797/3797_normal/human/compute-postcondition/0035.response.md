Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag`, `c` are assigned values returned by func_3(); `s` is a list containing at least 1 element with 'X' appended; `cnt` is 0; `this` is 1; `flag` is True; `c` is the next element in `s` or '.'; if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this, a raise statement is encountered which interrupts the program execution. If `this` is less than `a`, the program continues with the same state as before the if statement.***
