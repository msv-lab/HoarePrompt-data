Output State: **Output is 0, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the next element of `s` based on the current iteration. If this < a, the program continues without any changes. If a <= this < b or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this, an exception is raised. If 2 * b <= this, the program continues without any changes. `cnt` is increased by 1.**
