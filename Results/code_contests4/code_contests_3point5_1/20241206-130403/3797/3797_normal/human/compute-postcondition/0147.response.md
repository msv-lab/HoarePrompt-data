Postcondition: ***`s` is a list from input with an additional 'X' element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `this` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the condition is met, the loop executes the first time the input value is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the return values of `func_3()`, `flag` is True if the condition is met, otherwise `flag` remains False.***
