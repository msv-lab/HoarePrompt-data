Output State: **`s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the last element of `s`. If the last element of `s` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, the program terminates with an unhandled exception raised if 2 * b <= this and `this` is less than `a`. If the last element of `s` is not 'X' or less than or equal to 0, `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before the last 'X' in `s`. `cnt` is the count of 'X' elements in `s` minus 1.**
