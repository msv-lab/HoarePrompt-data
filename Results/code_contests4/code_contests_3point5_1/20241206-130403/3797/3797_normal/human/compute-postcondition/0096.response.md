Postcondition: ***Output is 0, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the next element of `s` based on the current iteration. If 2 * b <= this, and `this` is less than `a`, the program terminates with an unhandled exception raised. `this`, `cnt` remain unchanged after the execution of the if block.***
