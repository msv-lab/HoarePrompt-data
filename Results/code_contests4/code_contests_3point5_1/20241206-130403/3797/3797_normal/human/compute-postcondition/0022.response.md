Output State: **`a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag` are assigned values returned by func_3(); `s` is a list containing at least 1 element with 'X' appended; `cnt` is incremented by 1; `this` is assigned the value 0; `flag` remains True; for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first element in `s`; when the condition (c == 'X' and this > 0) is true, then `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0; after entering the if condition (2 * b <= this), `this` is at least twice the value of `b`; after entering the if condition (this < a), `this` is less than `a`.**
