Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped using tuple unpacking. The new value of `x` is the previous value of `y`, and the new value of `y` is the previous value of `x` modulo the previous value of `y`. Since for the loop to execute again `y` needs to be a truthy value, the loop will continue only if the new value of `y` is truthy. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` have been swapped, and for the loop to execute again `y` needs to be a truthy value.
Output State: **`x` and `y` have been swapped, and for the loop to execute again `y` needs to be a truthy value**
