Example Answer:
The `raise` keyword raises an exception and stops the program's execution. Since the statement is not inside a try-except block, the program will terminate with an unhandled exception. The values of the variables `s`, `c`, `this`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
Output State: **Output is 0, `s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the next element of `s` based on the current iteration, `this`, `cnt` remain unchanged. Program terminated with an unhandled exception due to the `raise` statement.**
