Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag`, `c` are assigned values returned by func_3(); `s` is a list containing at least 2 elements with 'X' appended. If `c` == 'X' and `this` > 0, then `cnt` is 2, `this` is 0, and if 2 * b <= this, `flag` is True. If `c` is not 'X' or `this` is not greater than 0, then `cnt` is 1, `this` is 3, and `flag` is False after the execution of the if else block.***
