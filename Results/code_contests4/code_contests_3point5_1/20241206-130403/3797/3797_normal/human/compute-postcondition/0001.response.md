The function `func_8` accepts two parameters, `x` and `r`. Both `x` and `r` are integers. The function calculates the value of (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounds down to the nearest integer, and returns the result. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept two integers `x` and `r`, perform the specified calculation, and return the result rounded down to the nearest integer.
