The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. **Precondition**: **q is a positive integer. For each query, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. s is a string of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5, consisting of only characters '.' and 'X'.** After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `x` and `y`, and return the greatest common divisor of their initial values.
