Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped, and then `y` is assigned the value of `x % y` where `%` is the modulo operator. The previous values of `x` and `y` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values after the swap and modulo operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` have been swapped, for the loop to execute again `y` needs to be a truthy value.
Output State: **`x` and `y` have been swapped, for the loop to execute again `y` needs to be a truthy value**
