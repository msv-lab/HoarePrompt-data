A `RuntimeError` exception could occur at any point in the program when a `raise` statement is encountered. The `try` block iterates through the elements of the input iterable `s`, performs certain checks, and updates variables accordingly. If any of the conditions are not met, a `raise` statement is executed, triggering a `RuntimeError`. 

The `except` block catches any `RuntimeError` that occurs within the `try` block and prints 'NO'. 

Therefore, the output state after the complete execution of the `try` statement is: `s` is a non-empty iterable, `c` represents the last element of `s`, `this` is the count of consecutive '.' characters before the last 'X' in `s`, `cnt` is the count of 'X' elements in `s` minus 1. The program prints 'YES' if `cnt` is even, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
