An exception could occur in the `try` block if any of the `raise` statements are triggered based on the conditions specified in the code. The try-except statement is used to handle any exceptions raised during the iteration over the list `s` and to print 'NO' if an exception occurs. 

Therefore, the output state after the execution of the `try` statement is:
Output State: **`s` is a list from input with an additional 'X' element, `c` is the last element of `s`, `this` is 0 or 1, `cnt` is the number of times the condition is met when `c == 'X'` and `this > 0`, the loop executes if the input value is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the return values of `func_3()`, `flag` is True if the condition is met, otherwise `flag` remains False. The program prints 'NO' if an exception is raised during the iteration.**
