According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `y` is truthy. At the end of the last iteration, `x` and `y` have been swapped. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `y` needs to be a truthy value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` and `y` have been swapped, for the loop to execute again `y` needs to be a truthy value**
