Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag`, `c` are assigned values returned by func_3(); `s` is a list containing at least 1 element with 'X' appended; `cnt` is 0; `this` is 1; if 2 * b <= this, `flag` is True. If `this` is less than `a`, the program continues with the same state as before the if statement. If `this` is not less than `a`, the program state remains unchanged.***
