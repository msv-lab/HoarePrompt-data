Postcondition: ***`s` has more elements with `c` being the next element in `s`, `this` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the condition is met, the input value is still greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the return values of `func_3()`, `flag` remains True if the condition is met. The program raises an exception and stops execution at this point. If `this` is less than `a` or `b` is greater than or equal to half of `this`, the program will raise an exception and halt execution.***
