Postcondition: ***`s` is a list with 'X' element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `this` is greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, the loop executes the first time the input value is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the return values of `func_3()`, `flag` is True. If `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0, and `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this`, a raise statement is encountered causing an exception to be raised and the program to terminate abruptly. After entering the if condition where `(2 * b <= this)`, the overall state of the program is maintained.***
