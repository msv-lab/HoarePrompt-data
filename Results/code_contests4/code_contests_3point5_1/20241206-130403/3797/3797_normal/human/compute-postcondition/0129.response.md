Postcondition: ***`s` is a list from input with an additional 'X' element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `this` is greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input value is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the return values of `func_3()`, `flag` is False. The condition is met where `c` is 'X' and `this` is greater than 0. Additionally, `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this`***
