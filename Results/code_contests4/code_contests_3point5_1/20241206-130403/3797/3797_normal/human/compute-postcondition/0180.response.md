Output State: **The loop will execute based on the input value. `a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag` will have values assigned from func_3() and loop operations. `s` will be a list with 'X' appended, `cnt` will be the count of 'X' elements followed by a sequence of '.', `this` will be the count of consecutive '.' before 'X', `flag` will be True if there are two consecutive '.', otherwise False. The program will print 'NO' if an exception is raised during the iteration, otherwise it will print 'YES' if cnt is odd and 'NO' if cnt is even.**
