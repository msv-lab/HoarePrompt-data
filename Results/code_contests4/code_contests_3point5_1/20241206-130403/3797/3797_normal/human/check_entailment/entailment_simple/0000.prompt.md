You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = func_3()
        
        s = list(input())
        
        s.append('X')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        this = 0
        
        flag = False
        
        try:
            for c in s:
                if c == 'X' and this > 0:
                    if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this:
                        raise
                    if 2 * b <= this:
                        if flag:
                            raise
                        flag = True
                        if this < a:
                            raise
                    cnt += 1
                    this = 0
                elif c == '.':
                    this += 1
            print('NO' if cnt % 2 else 'YES')
        except:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will execute based on the input value. `a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag` will have values assigned from func_3() and loop operations. `s` will be a list with 'X' appended, `cnt` will be the count of 'X' elements followed by a sequence of '.', `this` will be the count of consecutive '.' before 'X', `flag` will be True if there are two consecutive '.', otherwise False. The program will print 'NO' if an exception is raised during the iteration, otherwise it will print 'YES' if cnt is odd and 'NO' if cnt is even.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **q is a positive integer. For each query, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. s is a string of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5, consisting of only characters '.' and 'X'.**
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Both x and y will be assigned the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y. The loop will terminate when y becomes 0, and at that point, x will hold the greatest common divisor of the initial x and y values, while y will be 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers after converting the input values to integers using the map function and splitting the input

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **q is a positive integer. For each query, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. s is a string of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5, consisting of only characters . and X.**
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by calling func_4 with arguments from dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty, otherwise it returns the result of calling f()

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **start, step, and count are positive integers such that 1 <= step < start <= 3*10^5.**
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' up to 'start + step * count' with a step size of 'step'.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing a and b such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. start and end are non-negative integers representing the starting and ending positions of the substring in the string.**
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range starting from position 'start' up to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the result of 2 raised to the power of the length of (n - 1) in binary representation

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the value of (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounded down to the nearest integer


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
