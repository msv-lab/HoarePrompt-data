Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the logic implemented in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to determine if Alice can win based on the given substring and the game rules. However, the code does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when determining if Alice can win. The conditions and exceptions used in the code are not aligned with the game rules described in the problem statement.

One specific case where the code fails to produce the correct output is when Alice cannot make a move but the code incorrectly outputs 'YES'. This violates the game rules where the player who is unable to make a move should lose. Since the code does not handle all potential cases correctly, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
