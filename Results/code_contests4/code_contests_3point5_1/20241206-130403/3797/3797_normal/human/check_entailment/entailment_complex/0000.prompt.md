You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.

        a, b = func_3()
        
        s = list(input())

        try:
            for c in s:
                if c == 'X' and this > 0:
                    if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this:

            print('NO' if cnt % 2 else 'YES')
        except:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will execute based on the input value. `a`, `b`, `s`, `cnt`, `this`, `flag` will have values assigned from func_3() and loop operations. `s` will be a list with 'X' appended, `cnt` will be the count of 'X' elements followed by a sequence of '.', `this` will be the count of consecutive '.' before 'X', `flag` will be True if there are two consecutive '.', otherwise False. The program will print 'NO' if an exception is raised during the iteration, otherwise it will print 'YES' if cnt is odd and 'NO' if cnt is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 reads an integer input and iterates a loop that performs various operations based on the input values and the values returned from func_3. It handles a sequence of characters in a list, counts occurrences of specific characters, and determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **q is a positive integer. For each query, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. s is a string of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5, consisting of only characters '.' and 'X'.**
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Both x and y will be assigned the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y. The loop will terminate when y becomes 0, and at that point, x will hold the greatest common divisor of the initial x and y values, while y will be 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and calculates the greatest common divisor of their initial values using the Euclidean algorithm. It continuously updates the values of `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point it returns the greatest common divisor. The function adheres to the precondition that `q` is a positive integer, and for each query, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. `s` is a string of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5, consisting only of characters '.' and 'X'.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers after converting the input values to integers using the map function and splitting the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It converts the input values to integers using the map function and splits the input to return a list of integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **q is a positive integer. For each query, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. s is a string of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5, consisting of only characters . and X.**
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by calling func_4 with arguments from dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty, otherwise it returns the result of calling f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts a function f as a parameter. It then returns a list of values calculated by calling func_4 with arguments from dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty. If dim is empty, it returns the result of calling f().

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **start, step, and count are positive integers such that 1 <= step < start <= 3*10^5.**
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' up to 'start + step * count' with a step size of 'step'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts positive integers start, step, and count, and returns a range starting from 'start' up to 'start + step * count' with a step size of 'step'. The code accurately implements this functionality. No edge cases or missing functionality are apparent based on the provided code and annotations.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing a and b such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. start and end are non-negative integers representing the starting and ending positions of the substring in the string.**
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range starting from position 'start' up to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` of tuples and two integers `start` and `end`. It then returns a range starting from position `start` up to the length of list `l` plus `end`. The function does not consider the contents of the tuples within the list `l`, it solely operates based on the length of the list and the provided `start` and `end` values.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the result of 2 raised to the power of the length of (n - 1) in binary representation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns the result of 2 raised to the power of the length of (n - 1) in binary representation. It does not account for any edge cases or potential errors such as negative values of `n`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the value of (x + r - 1) divided by r, rounded down to the nearest integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters x and r, calculates the value of (x + r - 1) divided by r, and returns the result rounded down to the nearest integer.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
