The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and calculates the greatest common divisor of their initial values using the Euclidean algorithm. It continuously updates the values of `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point it returns the greatest common divisor. The function adheres to the precondition that `q` is a positive integer, and for each query, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. `s` is a string of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5, consisting only of characters '.' and 'X'.
