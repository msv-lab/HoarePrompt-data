Example Answer:
The raw input is checked if it is in the list ['a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o']. If the input is one of these letters, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The value of the variable `c` is not changed by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: c is a lowercase English letter.
Output State: **c is a lowercase English letter**
