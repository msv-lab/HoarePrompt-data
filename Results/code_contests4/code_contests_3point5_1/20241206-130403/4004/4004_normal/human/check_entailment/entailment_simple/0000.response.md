Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 
1. The program prints 'YES' for vowels and 'NO' for consonants, instead of 'vowel' and 'consonant' as specified in the problem description.
2. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3, it should use `input()` instead.
