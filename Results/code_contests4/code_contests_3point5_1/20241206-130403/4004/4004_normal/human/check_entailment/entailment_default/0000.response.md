Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply checks if the input is one of the vowels 'a', 'i', 'u', 'e', 'o' and prints 'YES' if it is one of these vowels, otherwise it prints 'NO'. However, the problem description requires printing 'vowel' if the input is a vowel and 'consonant' if it is not. Therefore, the code does not provide the correct output according to the problem description. 

Example where the code does not work correctly:
Input:
s
Expected Output:
consonant
The code will output 'NO' instead of 'consonant'.
