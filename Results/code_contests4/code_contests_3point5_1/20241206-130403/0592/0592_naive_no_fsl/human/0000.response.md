Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description for all potential cases. The program logic is flawed and does not accurately determine whether Vasya will go to Dasha, Masha, or both equally. The program uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is not directly related to the problem at hand.

Additionally, the comparison `g / min(a, b) == g / max(a, b) + 1` and the subsequent if-else conditions are not correct and do not provide the correct output.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
