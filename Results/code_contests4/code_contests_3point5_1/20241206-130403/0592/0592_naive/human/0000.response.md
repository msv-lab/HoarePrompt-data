Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the frequency at which Vasya will travel to each girlfriend based on the input values of a and b. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is then used to determine the total frequency at which the trains arrive concurrently. The program then compares the frequencies of the trains to determine whether Vasya will go to Dasha, Masha, or both equally. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
