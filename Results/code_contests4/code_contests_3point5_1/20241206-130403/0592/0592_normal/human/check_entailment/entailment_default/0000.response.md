Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
- The code does not handle the case where a and b are not coprime (a and b have a greatest common divisor greater than 1).
- The code does not correctly handle the scenario where Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often. It simply checks if a is less than b to determine if Vasya will go to Dasha or Masha more frequently, which is incorrect.
- The output hints provided are valid and they correctly describe the function func_1 that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- The code needs to be modified to consider all possible scenarios as described in the problem description to be correct.
