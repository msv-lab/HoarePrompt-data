Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers 'a' and 'b'. This algorithm is used to find the period at which the trains arrive simultaneously, as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
