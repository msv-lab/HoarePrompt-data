Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, size of arrays, and the arrays themselves.
2. The program implements the algorithm described in the problem statement where it checks if it is possible to make the array v equal to the given array a after some step.
3. The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether it is possible to achieve the given array a after some step.
4. The program uses a while loop to iterate over the elements of the array and performs the necessary calculations to determine if the array can be achieved.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic provided, making it correct for all potential cases.
