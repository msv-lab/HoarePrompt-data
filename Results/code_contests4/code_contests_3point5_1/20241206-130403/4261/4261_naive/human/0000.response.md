Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes it according to the rules specified, and then outputs "YES" or "NO" depending on whether the given array can be achieved after some steps. The logic in the program seems to be handling all the edge cases and scenarios mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the program structure and implementation match the requirements of the problem. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct for all potential cases.
