The function `func_1` processes a list of integers by performing operations involving variables 'n', 'k', 'li', 'req', 'r', 'i', and 'j' within nested loops. It updates 'req' with unique values of 'j', checks if certain conditions are met, and may call another function `func_2` with different arguments based on those conditions. The function has multiple potential return cases based on different scenarios involving the variables and sets mentioned, but it does not accept any parameters.
