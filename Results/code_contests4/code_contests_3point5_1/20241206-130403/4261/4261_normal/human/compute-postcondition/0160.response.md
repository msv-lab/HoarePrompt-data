Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 1. After execution, `j` becomes 2. Since `j` is not in `req`, it is added to `req`. The loop can now execute again because `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is 2, `r`, `j` is in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is 2, `r`, `j` is in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
