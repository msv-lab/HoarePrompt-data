According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is greater than or equal to 3 and increased by 1, `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be set to 0 since it is the condition for the loop. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is 0, `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
