According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list 'li'. If there are more elements left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 'r' and 'j' are in 'req', 'i' is updated based on calculations, 'req' contains all final values of 'j' after all iterations. To execute the loop one more time, the list 'li' must have more elements.
State: **'r' and 'j' are in 'req', 'i' is updated based on calculations, 'req' contains all final values of 'j' after all iterations, list 'li' has more elements**
