According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot make any definite conclusions about the values of `i`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state to `i` is greater than 0.
State: **for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0**
