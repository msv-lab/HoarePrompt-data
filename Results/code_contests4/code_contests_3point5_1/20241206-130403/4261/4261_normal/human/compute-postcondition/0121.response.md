According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` modulo `k` raised to the power of `j + 1` is equal to 0. Right before the loop, `r` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, and `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations. Additionally, `li` has more elements. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 1, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements**
