Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since the initial state of `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is the maximum value such that `i % k != 0`, the final value of `i` after the operation is calculated. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`r` is now in `req`, `i` is updated after performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is the maximum value such that `i % k`.**
