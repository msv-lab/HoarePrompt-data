Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is not in `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is not in `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
