Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly but works with predefined parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. It iterates through the elements in `args`, printing each element to a stream defined by `file`. The function handles the printing of elements with specified separators and end characters. If the `flush` key is True in the provided `kwargs`, it flushes the stream. However, it lacks clarity on how `args` is defined and how the elements of `a` are related to the printing process. The annotations mention the existence of `args` but it is not explicitly defined in the function signature.**
