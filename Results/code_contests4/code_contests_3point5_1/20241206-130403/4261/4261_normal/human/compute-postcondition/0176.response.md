The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It has multiple return cases based on different scenarios:

Case_1: The program returns the value of variable 'j' which is in the set 'req'.
Case_2: The program returns the final value of 'j' after all iterations of the loop where 'j' is in set 'req'.
Case_3: The program returns no specific value.
Case_4: The program returns the final value of 'j' after all iterations, which is in the set 'req'.
Case_5: The program returns the value of 'j' which is in the 'req' list after the calculations involving 'j' and 'i'.
Case_6: The program returns the updated value of variable 'j' which is now in 'req' after performing the described operations.
Case_7: The program does not affect any variables and returns nothing.
Case_8: The program returns the final value 'r' after all iterations.
Case_9: The program does not return any specific value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to have multiple return cases based on different scenarios involving variables and sets, without accepting any parameters.
