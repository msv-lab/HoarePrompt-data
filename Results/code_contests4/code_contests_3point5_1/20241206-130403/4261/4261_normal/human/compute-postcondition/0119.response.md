According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `i` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `r` is assigned the value 0, `j` remains in `req`, `i` is updated based on calculations, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, and list `li` has more elements. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is 0, `j` remains in `req`, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements**
