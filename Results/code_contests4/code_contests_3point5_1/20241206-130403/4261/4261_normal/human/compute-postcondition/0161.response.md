According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is 2, `r` and `j` are in `req`, and `j` is added to `req`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is 2, `r` and `j` are in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
