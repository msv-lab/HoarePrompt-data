According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, 'j' needs to be incremented to satisfy the condition. At the end of the previous iteration, 'j' is the final value after all iterations, and 'j' is not 0, so 'j' needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **'req' is a set containing the final values of 'j' after all iterations, 'r' is assigned the final value of 'j', 'li' is not empty, 'i' is greater than 0, 'k' is defined, 'j' is the final value after all iterations of the loop, 'i' is updated by performing floor division with 'k' raised to the power of 'j', 'j' needs to be added to 'req', 'j' is not 0, 'r' is 0, 'j' is incremented by 1**
