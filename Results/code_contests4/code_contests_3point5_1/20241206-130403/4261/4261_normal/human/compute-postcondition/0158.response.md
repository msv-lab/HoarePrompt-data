Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. `j` is then added to the list `req` since it was not there before. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is 1, `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is 1, `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
