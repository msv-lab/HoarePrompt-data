Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value 0. There is no impact on the variables `r` and `i` based on the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now in `req`, `i` is updated based on the calculation for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`r` is now in `req`, `i` is updated based on the calculation for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
