According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. If the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is satisfied, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is now in `req`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` need to be adjusted. Specifically, one possibility could be increasing the value of `j` by 1 as it appears in the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is now in `req`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer for the loop to execute one more time**
