According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated based on the calculation. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is still greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is now in `req`, `i` is updated based on the calculation for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0**
