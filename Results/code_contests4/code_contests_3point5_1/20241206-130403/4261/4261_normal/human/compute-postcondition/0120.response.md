Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements**
