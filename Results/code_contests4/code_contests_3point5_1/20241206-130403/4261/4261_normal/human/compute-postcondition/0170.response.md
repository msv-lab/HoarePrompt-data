Example Answer:
`j` is added to `req`, so now `j` is in `req`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: r is now equal to 3, j is 6, r and j are in req, j is added to req, for the loop to execute again i is greater than or equal to 1, i is updated by performing integer division with k raised to the power of j. j is now in req.
Output State: **r is now equal to 3, j is 6, r and j are in req, j is added to req, for the loop to execute again i is greater than or equal to 1, i is updated by performing integer division with k raised to the power of j. j is now in req**
