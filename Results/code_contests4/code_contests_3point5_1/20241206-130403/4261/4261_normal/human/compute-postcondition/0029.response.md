According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is satisfied, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `req` is a set containing the value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `li` is not empty, `i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `k` is defined, `i` is decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted: `i` needs to be greater than or equal to 0, `j` should be increased by `r`, `j` should be added to `req`.
State: **`req` is a set containing the value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `li` is not empty, `i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `k` is defined, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is added to `req`**
