According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is not in `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `(j + 1)`
- `j + 1` should not be in `req`, meaning that `j` needs to be such that `j + 1` is not in `req`
- `i` should be decreased by 1
- `j` should be increased by 1

State: **`r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, `j + 1` is not in `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, and `j` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again**
