Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since the initial value of `i` is not given and `k` is also not specified, we cannot calculate the exact value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: r is now equal to 3, j is 3, r and j are in req, j is added to req, for the loop to execute again i is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`.
Output State: **r is now equal to 3, j is 3, r and j are in req, j is added to req, for the loop to execute again i is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j`.**
