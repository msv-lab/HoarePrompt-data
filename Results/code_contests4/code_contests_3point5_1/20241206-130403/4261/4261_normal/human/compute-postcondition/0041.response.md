According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decreased by 1 and is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`req` is a set containing the value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `li` is not empty, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `k` is defined, `i` is decreased by 1 and is less than or equal to 0, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0**
