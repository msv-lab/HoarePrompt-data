Output State: **`r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req**.
