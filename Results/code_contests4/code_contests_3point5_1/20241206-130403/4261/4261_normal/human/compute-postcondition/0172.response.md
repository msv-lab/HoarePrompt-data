Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but we know that it was updated by performing integer division with `k` raised to the power of `j` before. Therefore, the updated value of `i` after executing `i -= 1` will be one less than the previous value. The values of `r` and `j` are not affected by this operation. The fact that `j` is in `req` also remains unchanged.
Output State: **r is now equal to 6, j is 6 and in req, j is added to req, i is one less than the previous value after division with k^j, j is now in req**
