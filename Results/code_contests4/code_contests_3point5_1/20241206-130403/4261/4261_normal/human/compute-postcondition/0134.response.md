Example Answer:
`j` is added to the set `req`, so `j` will be included in the set of final values after all iterations. The set `req` now contains all final values of `j` after all iterations. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req`.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req`**
