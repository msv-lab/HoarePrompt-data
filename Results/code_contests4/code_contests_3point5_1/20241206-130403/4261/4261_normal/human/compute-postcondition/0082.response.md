According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is assigned the value 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to 1 or greater. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i % k ** (j + 1)` is equal to 0**
