According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is less than or equal to 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **'req' is a set containing the final values of 'j' after all iterations, 'r' is assigned the final value of 'j', 'li' is not empty, 'i' is greater than 0, 'k' is defined, 'j' is the final value after all iterations of the loop, 'i' is updated by performing floor division with 'k' raised to the power of 'j', 'j' is not in 'req', 'r' is 0**
