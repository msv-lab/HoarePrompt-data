According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 0, `j` is 3, `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 3, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1**
