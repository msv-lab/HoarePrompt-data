According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is true, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4. To ensure the loop executes again, `j` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 4, for the loop to execute again `j` is greater than 4**
