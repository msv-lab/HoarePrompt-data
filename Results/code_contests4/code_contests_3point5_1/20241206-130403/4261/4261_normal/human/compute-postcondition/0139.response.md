According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `req`. 

Right before the loop, `r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`.
- `j` is not in `req`.
- `i` is decreased by 1.

State: **`r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is greater or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is not in `req`, `i` is decreased by 1**
