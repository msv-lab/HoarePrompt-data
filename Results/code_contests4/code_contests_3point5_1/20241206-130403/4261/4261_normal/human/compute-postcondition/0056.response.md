Example Answer:
After executing `req.add(j)`, the value of `j` is added to the set `req`. The values of `r`, `li`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The loop condition to update `i` and `j` is not met, so they remain as is. Therefore, the Output State is: `req` contains the value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `li` is not empty, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `k` is defined, `i` is decreased by 1 and is less than or equal to 0, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the maximum value where `i % k`, `j` is not in `req`.
Output State: **`req` contains the value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `li` is not empty, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `k` is defined, `i` is decreased by 1 and is less than or equal to 0, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the maximum value where `i % k`, `j` is not in `req`**
