According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is now in `req`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the values need to be adjusted so that `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` still holds true. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `r`, `i`, and `j`, but `k` must be modified such that it satisfies the condition `k` is a positive integer for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`r` is now in `req`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again, `k` is a positive integer**
