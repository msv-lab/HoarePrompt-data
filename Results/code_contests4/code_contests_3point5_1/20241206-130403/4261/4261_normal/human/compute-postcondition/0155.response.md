According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decreased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`r` is now equal to `j`, `j` is greater than or equal to 3 and increased by 1, `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `j` is added to `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
