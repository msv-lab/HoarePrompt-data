According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. Right before the loop, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. 'j' is the final value after all iterations, so it needs to be in the set 'req'.
2. 'j' is not in 'req', so 'j' needs to be added to the set 'req'.
3. 'j' is 0, so 'j' needs to be updated to a value other than 0 for the loop to execute.
State: **'req' is a set containing the final values of 'j' after all iterations, 'r' is assigned the final value of 'j', 'li' is not empty, 'i' is greater than 0, 'k' is defined, 'j' is the final value after all iterations of the loop, 'i' is updated by performing floor division with 'k' raised to the power of 'j', 'j' needs to be added to 'req', 'j' is not 0, 'r' is 0**
