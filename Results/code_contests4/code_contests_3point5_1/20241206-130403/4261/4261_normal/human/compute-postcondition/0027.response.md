According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:

`req` is a set containing the value of `j`
`r` is assigned the value of `j`
`li` is not empty
`i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`
`j` is increased by `r`
`j` is not in `req`
`k` is defined
`i` is decreased by 1
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` is greater than 0
`j` is 1

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` needs to be greater than or equal to 0
2. `j` needs to be increased by `r`
3. `j` needs to be added to `req`

State: **`req` is a set containing the value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `li` is not empty, `i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `k` is defined, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is added to `req`**
