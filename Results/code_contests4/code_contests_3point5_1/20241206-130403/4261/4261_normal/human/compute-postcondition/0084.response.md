According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0**.
