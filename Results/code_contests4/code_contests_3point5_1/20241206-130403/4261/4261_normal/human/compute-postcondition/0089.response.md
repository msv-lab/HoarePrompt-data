Example Answer:
The value of `i` is assigned `i` divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. Since `j` is 5, the value of `i` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 5, `i` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`j` is 5, `i` is updated based on the calculation**
