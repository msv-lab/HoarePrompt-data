According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 3, so `j` needs to be increased by 2.
- `j + 1` should not be in `req`, so no adjustment needed.
- `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, so `i` needs to be adjusted accordingly.
- `i` is decreased by 1, so no adjustment needed.
- `r` is the final value after all iterations, so no adjustment needed.

State: **`r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`, `j + 1` is not in `req`, `i` is decreased by 1, and `j` is increased by 2 for the loop to execute again**
