Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `j` is 2, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements**
