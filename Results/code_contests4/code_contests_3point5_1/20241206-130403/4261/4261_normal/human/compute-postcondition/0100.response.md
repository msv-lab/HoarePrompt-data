According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is updated based on the calculation for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` needs to be a positive integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is now in `req`, `i` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0, `k` is a positive integer**
