According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. Also, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, so `i` needs to meet this condition. Furthermore, `j` should not be in `req`, and `i` is decreased by 1.
State: **`r` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is greater than 0, `req` contains all final values of `j` after all iterations, list `li` has more elements, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req, `i` is decreased by 1**
