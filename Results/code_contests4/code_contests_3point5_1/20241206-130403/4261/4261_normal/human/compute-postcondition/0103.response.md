Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is now in `req`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`r` is now in `req`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer for the loop to execute one more time**
