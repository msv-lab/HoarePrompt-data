The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function works with the predefined parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers within the range [0, 10^16]. The function does not return any value explicitly, as its purpose is to perform certain operations or calculations based on the provided parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`.
