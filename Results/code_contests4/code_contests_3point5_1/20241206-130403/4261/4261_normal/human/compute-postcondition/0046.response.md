Output State: **`req` is a set containing the value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `li` is not empty, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req`, `k` is defined, `i` is decreased by 1 and is less than or equal to 0, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is updated by performing floor division with `k` raised to the power of `j`, and `j` is not in `req`, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is further increased by 1.**
