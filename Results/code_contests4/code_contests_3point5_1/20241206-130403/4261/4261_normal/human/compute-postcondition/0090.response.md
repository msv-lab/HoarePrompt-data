Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by `r`, but the value of `r` is not provided in the initial state, so the final value of `j` cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`j` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is updated based on the calculation**
