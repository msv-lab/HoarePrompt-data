Example Answer:
`at_start` is directly assigned the value `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `args` still has more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`, `file.write(sep)` is executed, `file.write(str(x))` is executed, `sep` is written to the file if `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` still has more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`, `file.write(sep)` is executed, `file.write(str(x))` is executed, `sep` is written to the file if `at_start` is False**
