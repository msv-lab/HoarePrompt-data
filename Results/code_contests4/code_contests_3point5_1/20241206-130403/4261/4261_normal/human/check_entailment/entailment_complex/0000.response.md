Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After carefully analyzing the provided Python program and the problem description, it can be observed that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the processing of test cases according to the specified rules and conditions. `func_1` correctly determines whether the given array `a` can be achieved after some step by applying the defined algorithm. The annotations provide a clear understanding of the state of the program before and after the function calls, helping in verifying the correctness of the code. Additionally, the example test cases in the problem description align with the expected output of the program. Hence, based on the analysis, the code is deemed correct.
