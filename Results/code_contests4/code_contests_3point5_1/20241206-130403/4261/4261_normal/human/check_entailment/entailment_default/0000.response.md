Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case accordingly.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the arrays `v` and `a`, as well as the value of `k`.
- It then reads the array `a` that needs to be achieved.
- The code iterates through the elements of `a` and performs calculations to determine if it is possible to achieve the desired array `a` using the given algorithm.
- The function `func_2` is used to print the result 'YES' or 'NO' based on the outcome of the calculations.
- The code handles the logic of the algorithm correctly and prints the result for each test case.

Overall, the code seems to follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree with the code by providing examples of how the algorithm can be applied to determine if the given array `a` can be achieved.
