Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem description. 

1. `func_1` reads the inputs, calculates the required values of `j`, and checks if it's possible to achieve the given array `a`. It considers all possible values of `j` and checks for uniqueness using a set `req`. If there is a repetition, it returns 'NO', otherwise 'YES'.
2. `func_2` is a utility function to print the output.

The program handles each test case as described in the problem statement and correctly determines if it's possible to achieve the given array `a` after some steps. The algorithm used in `func_1` considers all scenarios and handles the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
