Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input values N, A, B, and the list of values v. It then calculates all possible combinations of items to select within the range of A to B items. For each combination, it calculates the average value and keeps track of the maximum average value and the number of times it occurs. Finally, it prints out the maximum average value and the number of times it occurred.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the selected items and the number of ways to select items to achieve that mean. It considers all combinations within the specified range of items to select and calculates the average value of each combination accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
