Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `resultCount`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` will contain the maximum average value calculated from all the combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times the `resultValue` occurred as the average.
Output State: **`resultValue` will contain the maximum average value calculated from all the combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times the `resultValue` occurred as the average**
