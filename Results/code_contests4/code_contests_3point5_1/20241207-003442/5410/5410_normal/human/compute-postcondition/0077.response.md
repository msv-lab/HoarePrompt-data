According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `perm`. If there are more elements in `perm`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition. We need to check the conditions mentioned in the description to determine the states for the next iteration. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. If `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultValue` and `resultCount` are incremented by 1.

So for the loop to be executed one more time:
- If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` should be updated to `average` and `resultCount` should be set to 1.
- If `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultValue` and `resultCount` should be incremented by 1.
- `pcs`, `perm`, and `average` remain unchanged.

State: **`resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition.**
