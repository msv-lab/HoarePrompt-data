According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `N`, `A`, `B`, `pcs`, `perm`, `cand`, and `average`. 

If `resultValue` is less than the calculated average of `cand`, then `resultCount` is set to 1, and `N`, `A`, `B`, `resultValue` are updated to the new calculated average of `cand`. Additionally, `pcs` and `perm` are updated to the next combination in `perm`.

If `resultValue` is equal to the calculated average of `cand`, then `N`, `A`, `B`, `resultValue`, `resultCount` are all incremented by 1. The values of `pcs`, `perm`, and `cand` are updated accordingly.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `N`, `A`, `B`, `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm`, `cand`, `average` are as follows: *N*, *A*, *B*, *resultValue*, *resultCount*, *pcs*, *perm*, *cand*, *average*.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `resultValue` is less than the calculated average of `cand`, then update `resultCount` to 1, and update `N`, `A`, `B`, `resultValue` to the new calculated average of `cand`. Also, update `pcs` and `perm` to the next combination in `perm`.
- If `resultValue` is equal to the calculated average of `cand`, then increment `N`, `A`, `B`, `resultValue`, `resultCount` by 1. Update the values of `pcs`, `perm`, and `cand` accordingly.

State: **N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount, pcs, perm, cand, average** at the start of the next iteration.
