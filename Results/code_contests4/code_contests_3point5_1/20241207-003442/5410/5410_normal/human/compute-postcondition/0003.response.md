Example Answer:
`resultCount` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: N, A, B are integers satisfying the given constraints, v is a map object containing integers obtained by mapping the input values with int() and splitting them by whitespace, `resultValue` is 0, `resultCount` is 0.
Output State: **N, A, B are integers satisfying the given constraints, v is a map object containing integers obtained by mapping the input values with int() and splitting them by whitespace, `resultValue` is 0, `resultCount` is 0**
