Example Answer:
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The value of `resultCount` was 1, so after execution, `resultCount` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultCount` is 2, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`.
Output State: **`resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultCount` is 2, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`**
