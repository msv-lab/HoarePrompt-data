Example Answer: 
The code prints the value stored in `resultValue`. No variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` will contain the maximum average value calculated from all the combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times the `resultValue` occurred as the average. All other variables will remain unchanged.
