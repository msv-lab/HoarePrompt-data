Output State: After all iterations of the loop have executed, `resultValue` will contain the maximum average value calculated from all the combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times the `resultValue` occurred as the average. All other variables will remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `pcs` must be less than `B - A + 1`.
