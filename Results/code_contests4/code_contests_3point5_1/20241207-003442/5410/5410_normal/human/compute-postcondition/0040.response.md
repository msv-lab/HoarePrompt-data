Example Answer:
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so the output state is: `resultCount` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`After all iterations of the loop have executed, `resultValue` will contain the maximum average value calculated from all the combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times the `resultValue` occurred as the average. All other variables will remain unchanged. Additionally, `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`. Furthermore, `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1**
