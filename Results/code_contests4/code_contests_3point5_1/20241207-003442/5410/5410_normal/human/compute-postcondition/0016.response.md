According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `perm`, `cand`, and other related variables. If there are more combinations left in `perm`, the loop can execute another time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
State: **N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount, pcs, perm, cand, average**

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `cand` should be updated to the next combination in `perm`
- If `cand` is not the last combination in `perm`, the loop can execute again

State: **N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount, pcs, perm (updated), cand (next combination in perm), average**
