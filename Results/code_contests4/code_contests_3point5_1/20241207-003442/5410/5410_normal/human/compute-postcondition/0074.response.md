Example Answer:
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, but after execution, `resultCount` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, `pcs`, `perm`, `average` remain the same.
Output State: **`resultValue`, `resultCount` is incremented by 1, `pcs`, `perm`, `average` remain the same**
