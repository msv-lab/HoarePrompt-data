`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `resultCount` is 2. The values of `resultValue` and `average` are not affected. 
Output State: **`resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultCount` is 2, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`**
