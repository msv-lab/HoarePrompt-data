Postcondition: ***`resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition. If `resultValue` is less than the calculated average value, `resultCount` is 1. If `resultValue` is equal to the calculated average value, `resultCount` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
