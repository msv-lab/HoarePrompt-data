Functionality: **The function reads input parameters N, A, B and a list v. It then calculates the average of all combinations of v elements with lengths ranging from B to B + N. The function finds the maximum average value among these combinations and the number of times this maximum value occurs. Finally, it prints the maximum average value and the count of occurrences of this value.**
