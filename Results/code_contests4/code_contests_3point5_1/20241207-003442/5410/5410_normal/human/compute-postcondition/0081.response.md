Example Answer:
`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown, so after execution, `resultCount` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition, `average` is the calculated average value, `resultCount` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`resultValue`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition, `average` is the calculated average value, `resultCount` is increased by 1**
