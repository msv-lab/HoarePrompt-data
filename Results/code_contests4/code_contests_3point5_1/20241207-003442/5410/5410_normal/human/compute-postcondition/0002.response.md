Example Answer: 
`resultValue` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N, A, B are integers satisfying the given constraints, v is a map object containing integers obtained by mapping the input values with int() and splitting them by whitespace, `resultValue` is 0.
Output State: **N, A, B are integers satisfying the given constraints, v is a map object containing integers obtained by mapping the input values with int() and splitting them by whitespace, `resultValue` is 0**
