Example Answer:
`resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`, and `average` is a calculated value. The states of `resultCount`, `pcs`, and `perm` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is the calculated average value, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` remain as described in the precondition.
Output State: **`resultValue` is the calculated average value, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` remain as described in the precondition**
