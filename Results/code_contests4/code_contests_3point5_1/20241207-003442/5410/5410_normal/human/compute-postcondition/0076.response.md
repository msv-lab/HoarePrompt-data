Postcondition: ***`resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition. If `resultValue` is less than `average`, then `resultValue` is assigned the value of `average` and `resultCount` is set to 1. If `resultValue` is equal to `average`, then `resultValue` and `resultCount` are incremented by 1, `pcs`, `perm`, and `average` remain unchanged.***
