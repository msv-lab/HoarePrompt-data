Example Answer:
`resultValue` is assigned the value of `average`, which is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`. The initial state indicates that `resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultCount` is 1, and `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`. After execution, `resultValue` is equal to `average`, maintaining the relationship. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is equal to the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`, `resultCount` is 1, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`.
Output State: **`resultValue` is equal to the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`, `resultCount` is 1, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`**
