According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `perm`. If perm is a list with at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `average`, and `pcs` need to be adjusted to correctly represent the initial state for the loop to execute. 
State: **`resultValue` is the maximum average value, `resultCount` is the number of times maximum average occurred, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`, `pcs` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `perm` is a list with at least 1 element**
