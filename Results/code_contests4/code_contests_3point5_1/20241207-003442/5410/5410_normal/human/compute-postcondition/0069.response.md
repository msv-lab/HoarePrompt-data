Postcondition: ***`resultValue`, `resultCount`, `average`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition. If `resultValue` < `average`, then `resultValue` is the calculated average, `resultCount` is 1, and `resultValue` is less than `average`. If `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, then `resultValue` is the maximum average value, `resultCount` is the number of times maximum average occurred incremented by 1, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`, `pcs` is incremented by 1, `perm` is a list with at least 1 element, and `resultValue` is equal to `average` after the execution of the if else block.***
