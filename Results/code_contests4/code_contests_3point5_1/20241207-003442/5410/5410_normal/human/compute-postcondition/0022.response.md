Postcondition: ***N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount, pcs, perm, cand, average are variables. If resultValue is less than the calculated average of `cand`, then resultCount is set to 1, and N, A, B, resultValue are updated to the new calculated average of `cand`. Additionally, pcs and perm are updated to the next combination in perm. If resultValue is equal to the calculated average of `cand`, then N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount are all incremented by 1. The values of pcs, perm, and cand are updated accordingly. There is no change in the else part.***
