Example Answer:
`resultCount` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of the other variables are unknown, so the output state is: N, A, B, resultValue is the calculated average of `cand`, resultCount is 1, pcs, perm (updated), cand (next combination in perm), average is the calculated average of `cand`.
Output State: **N, A, B, resultValue is the calculated average of `cand`, resultCount is 1, pcs, perm (updated), cand (next combination in perm), average is the calculated average of `cand`**
