Example Answer:
The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the elements in the list `cand` by the length of the list. The value of `average` is updated accordingly. The previous state of `resultValue` and `resultCount` is mentioned where `resultValue` is less than `average` and `resultCount` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultCount` is 1, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`.
Output State: **`resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultCount` is 1, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`**
