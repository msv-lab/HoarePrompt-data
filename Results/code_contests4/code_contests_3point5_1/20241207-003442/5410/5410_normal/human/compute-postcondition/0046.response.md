Example Answer:
The value of `resultCount` is assigned 1. This overwrites the previous value of `resultCount`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is 1, `average` is the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`.**
