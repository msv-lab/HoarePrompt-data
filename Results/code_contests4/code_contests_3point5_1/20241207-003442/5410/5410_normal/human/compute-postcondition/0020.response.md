`resultCount` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `resultCount` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount is incremented by 1, pcs, perm (updated), cand (next combination in perm), average is the calculated average of `cand`.
Output State: **N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount is incremented by 1, pcs, perm (updated), cand (next combination in perm), average is the calculated average of `cand`**
