Example Answer:
The code calculates the average of the elements in the list `cand` and assigns it to the variable `average`. The variables `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, and `perm` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition, `average` is the average of elements in the list `cand`.
Output State: **`resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition, `average` is the average of elements in the list `cand`**
