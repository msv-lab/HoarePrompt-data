Example Answer:
The variable `average` is assigned the result of the division of the sum of the elements in `cand` by the length of `cand`. The values of `N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount, pcs, perm, and cand` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount, pcs, perm (updated), cand (next combination in perm), average is the calculated average of `cand`.
Output State: **N, A, B, resultValue, resultCount, pcs, perm (updated), cand (next combination in perm), average is the calculated average of `cand`**
