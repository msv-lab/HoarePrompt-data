Postcondition: ***N, A, B are integers satisfying the given constraints. v is a map object containing integers obtained by mapping the input values with int() and splitting them by whitespace. If `resultValue` is less than the calculated average, `resultCount` is set to 1, `pcs` is in the range from A to B, inclusive, `perm` is a list of all combinations of length B + pcs from the elements in v, cand is the first combination in perm, average is the calculated average of the elements in cand. Otherwise, if `resultValue` is equal to the average, `resultCount` is incremented by 1.***
