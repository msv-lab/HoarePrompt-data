Example Answer:
The variable `average` is calculated by taking the sum of the elements in the list `cand` and dividing it by the length of the list. The variables `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, and `perm` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition, `average` is the calculated average value.
Output State: **`resultValue`, `resultCount`, `pcs`, `perm` are as described in the precondition, `average` is the calculated average value**
