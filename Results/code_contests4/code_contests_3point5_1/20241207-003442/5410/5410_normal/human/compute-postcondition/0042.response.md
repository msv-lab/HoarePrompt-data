Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have executed, `resultValue` will contain the maximum average value calculated from all the combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times the `resultValue` occurred as the average. All other variables will remain unchanged. Additionally, if `resultValue` is less than `average`, `resultCount` is 1. If `resultValue` is greater than or equal to `average`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times `resultValue` occurred as the average. If `resultValue` is equal to `average`, `resultCount` is increased by 1.***
