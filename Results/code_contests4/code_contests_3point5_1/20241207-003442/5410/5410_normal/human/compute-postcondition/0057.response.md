Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have executed, `resultValue` will contain the maximum average value calculated from all the combinations in `perm`, `resultCount` will represent the number of times the `resultValue` occurred as the average. All other variables will remain unchanged. Additionally, if `resultValue` is less than or equal to `average`, `resultCount` will be either 1 or 2 depending on the comparison, and `average` will be the calculated average of elements in the list `cand`.**
