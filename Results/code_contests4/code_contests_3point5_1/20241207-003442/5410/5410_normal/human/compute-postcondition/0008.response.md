Postcondition: ***N, A, B are integers satisfying the given constraints. v is a map object containing integers obtained by mapping the input values with int() and splitting them by whitespace. resultValue is 0, resultCount is 0, pcs is in the range from A to B, inclusive, perm is a list of all combinations of length B + pcs from the elements in v, cand is the first combination in perm, average is the calculated average of the elements in cand. After entering the if condition (resultValue < average), the program state is as described above with the additional condition that resultValue is less than average***
