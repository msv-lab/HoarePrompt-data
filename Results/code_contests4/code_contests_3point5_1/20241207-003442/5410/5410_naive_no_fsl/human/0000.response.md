Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for N, A, B, and the list of values v.
2. It iterates through all possible combinations of items to select, ensuring that the number of selected items is at least A and at most B.
3. It calculates the average value of the selected items and updates the maximum average and count accordingly.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items and the number of ways to select items so that the mean is maximized.
5. The program uses the itertools library to generate combinations of items, ensuring that all possible combinations are considered.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and the provided examples, making it correct for all potential cases.
