Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items and the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized. The program iterates through all possible combinations of items within the range specified by A and B, calculates the average value of each combination, and updates the resultValue and resultCount accordingly. The use of itertools.combinations ensures that all possible combinations are considered. The program then outputs the correct maximum arithmetic mean and the number of ways to achieve that mean. Since the program covers all potential cases by considering all combinations, it is correct.
