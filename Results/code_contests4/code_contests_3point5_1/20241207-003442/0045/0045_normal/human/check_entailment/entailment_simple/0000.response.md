Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input data for the cards and stores them in a dictionary where the keys are the suits and the values are lists representing the presence of each rank. It then iterates through each suit and rank, printing out the missing cards in the specified order. The program follows the problem description and outputs the missing cards as expected.
