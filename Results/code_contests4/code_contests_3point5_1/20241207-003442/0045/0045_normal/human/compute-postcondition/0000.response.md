Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any integer between 0 and 52 based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52**
