Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of k and i+1 in the format specified. The value of i is 2, so i+1 becomes 3. The key 'H' in dictionary d has at least one more element with a boolean value of False to be processed. Therefore, the program will execute the print statement. 
Output State: **n is an integer where 0 <= n <= 52, d is a dictionary where 'H' key has at least one more element with a boolean value of False to be processed, i is 2. The program prints the value of k and i+1 in the specified format.**
