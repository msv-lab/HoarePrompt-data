Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of k followed by the value of i incremented by 1 using string formatting. The value of i is 14, so i + 1 is 15. The value of k is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 0 and 52, d is a dictionary with the key 'C' having at least one more element with a boolean value of False, i is 14, and the code snippet prints '%s %d' % (k, 15).
Output State: **n is an integer between 0 and 52, d is a dictionary with the key 'C' having at least one more element with a boolean value of False, i is 14, and the code snippet prints '%s %d' % (k, 15)**
