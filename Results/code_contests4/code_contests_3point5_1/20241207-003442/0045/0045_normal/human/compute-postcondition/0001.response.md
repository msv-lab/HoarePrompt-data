Example Answer:
Each key in the dictionary `d` is assigned a list of 13 `None` values. Since the dictionary `d` is newly created and all values are initialized to `None`, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 `None` values**
