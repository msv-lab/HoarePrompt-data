Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, d is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 boolean values based on user input, x, y are assigned the values from the user input split, for the loop to execute i is in range of 13. If d[k][i] is true, the program executes certain actions based on the value of d[k][i]. The code prints the string representation of k followed by the value of i + 1. The loop continues without any change in the state of variables.**
