Postcondition: ***n is an integer where 0 <= n <= 52, d is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 14 boolean values based on user input, x, y are assigned the values from the user input split. To execute the loop one more time, the next key 'C' must be processed, and the corresponding list must have at least one more element with a boolean value of False. i is 14. After the execution of the if else block, the boolean value at index i of the list corresponding to key k in dictionary d is True if the condition d[k][i] is True.***
