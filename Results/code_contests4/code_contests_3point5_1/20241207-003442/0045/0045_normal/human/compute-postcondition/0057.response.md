Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, d is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 boolean values based on user input, x, y are assigned the values from the user input split. The loop will iterate through all keys in the dictionary and their corresponding lists, printing the key and index if the boolean value is False. No changes are made to the initial state variables after the loop finishes executing.**
