According to the code, the loop will always execute for i in range(13). 
Since the loop will always execute for a range of 13, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 boolean values (True or None) based on user input, `x`, `y` are assigned the values from the user input split, for the loop to execute `i` is in range of 13**
