Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of playing cards to generate. It then prompts the user to input the suit and rank of each card, storing this information in a dictionary `d` where each suit has a list of boolean values representing the presence of cards of that suit and rank. Afterward, it iterates through each suit and rank, printing out the missing cards that were not input by the user. The functionality of the function is to handle input for a subset of playing cards, fill in the missing cards, and display them in a standard deck format.**
