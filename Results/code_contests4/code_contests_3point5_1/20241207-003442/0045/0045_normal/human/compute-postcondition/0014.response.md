Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 boolean values (True or None) based on user input, `x`, `y` are assigned the values from the user input split, for the loop to execute `i` is in range of 13. When the condition (d[k][i]) is true for the current key and index, the program state is such that the value at key 'k' and index 'i' in dictionary `d` evaluates to True***
