Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, d is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 boolean values (True or None) based on user input, x, y are assigned the values from the user input split, for the loop to execute i is in range of 13. If the condition (d[k][i]) is true for the current key and index, the value at key 'k' and index 'i' in dictionary d evaluates to True. The print statement '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) will display the current key 'k' and the index incremented by 1 i.e., (i + 1).**
