#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52. Each card is represented by a character (suit) and an integer (rank), where the character can be 'S', 'H', 'C', or 'D' for spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds respectively, and the rank is an integer from 1 to 13.**
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    d = {'S': [None] * 13, 'H': [None] * 13, 'C': [None] * 13, 'D': [None] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = raw_input().split()
        
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 boolean values (True or None) based on user input, `x`, `y` are assigned the values from the user input split
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, d is a dictionary where each key 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' is assigned a list of 13 boolean values based on user input, x, y are assigned the values from the user input split. The loop will iterate through all keys in the dictionary and their corresponding lists, printing the key and index if the boolean value is False. No changes are made to the initial state variables after the loop finishes executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of playing cards to generate. It then prompts the user to input the suit and rank of each card, storing this information in a dictionary `d` where each suit has a list of boolean values representing the presence of cards of that suit and rank. Afterward, it iterates through each suit and rank, printing out the missing cards that were not input by the user. The functionality of the function is to handle input for a subset of playing cards, fill in the missing cards, and display them in a standard deck format.
