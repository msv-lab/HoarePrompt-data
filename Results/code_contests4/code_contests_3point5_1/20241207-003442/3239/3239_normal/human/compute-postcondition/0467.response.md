Example Answer:
`g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, which has been increased by 1. The list `l` has `j` appended to it, and `j` is also increased by 1. Therefore, after execution, `g[9]` is equal to the new value of `j`, and `l` contains the updated list with the new value of `j` appended to it.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` have been updated, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to list `l`, `g[9]` is equal to the new value of `j`**
