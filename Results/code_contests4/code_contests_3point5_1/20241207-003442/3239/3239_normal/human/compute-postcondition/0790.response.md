Example Answer:
`g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, `g[2]` is equal to the new value of `j`. The state of other variables is not affected. 
Output State: **`l` is updated with the appended value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, `g[2]` is equal to the new value of `j`**
