Example Answer:
The code appends the value at index 8 of array `g` to array `l`. The previous values of variables `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, and the value at index 8 of array `g` is appended to array `l`.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, and the value at index 8 of array `g` is appended to array `l`**
