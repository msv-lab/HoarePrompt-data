Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is either a list containing 12 zeros with the 6th element being the 6th element of list `g` if a[i] % 11 == 0 and the 6th element of list `f` is true, or a list containing 12 zeros with the 6th element being 1 if a[i] % 11 == 0 and the 6th element of list `f` is false. `f` is a list containing either 12 zeros with the 8th element incremented by 1 if a[i] % 17 == 0, or a list containing 13 zeros with the value at index 9 incremented by 1 if a[i] % 23 == 0. `g` is a list containing either 1 element which is 0 or the incremented value of `j`. `j` is either 0 or 1. For the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. If a[i] % 13 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 13 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 17 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 17 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 23 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 23 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part.***
