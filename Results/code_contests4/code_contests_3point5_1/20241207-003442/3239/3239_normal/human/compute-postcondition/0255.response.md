Example Answer:
The value at index 9 in array g is appended to array l. The content of arrays a, f, and l is not specified, but the value at index 9 in array g will be added to array l. Therefore, the Output State is: the value at index 9 in array g is appended to array l.
Output State: **the value at index 9 in array g is appended to array l**
