Example Answer:
`g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` was previously incremented by 1. The other variables `a`, `f`, `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Increment of `j` by 1, `a`, `f`, `l` remain the same, `g[3]` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **Increment of `j` by 1, `a`, `f`, `l` remain the same, `g[3]` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`**
