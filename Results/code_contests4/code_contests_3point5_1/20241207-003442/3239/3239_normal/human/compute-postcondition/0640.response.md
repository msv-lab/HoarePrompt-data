Output State: **`l` is a list containing 1 if `f[6]` is true, otherwise `l` contains the value of `g[6]`. `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`. `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0. `g` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0. `j` is 1 if `f[6]` is not true, otherwise `j` remains 0. For the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. `a[i]` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 13. The element at index 6 in list `f` is not True if the else part is executed, otherwise, it remains unchanged. `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[6]` is incremented by 1.**
