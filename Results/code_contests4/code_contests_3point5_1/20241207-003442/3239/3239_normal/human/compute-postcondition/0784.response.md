Example Answer:
`g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is appended to the list `l`. The values of `g[1]` and `j` are now the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is appended to the list `l`, `g[1]` is equal to `j`.
Output State: **`j` is appended to the list `l`, `g[1]` is equal to `j`**
