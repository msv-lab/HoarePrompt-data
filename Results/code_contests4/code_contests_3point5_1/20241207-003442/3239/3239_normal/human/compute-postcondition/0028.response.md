Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is an empty list, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, and a[i] is not divisible by 3. The value of `i` is such that a[i] % 5 == 0***
