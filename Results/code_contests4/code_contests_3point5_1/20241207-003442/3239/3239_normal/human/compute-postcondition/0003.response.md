According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the args list. If args has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `at_start` is True. So for the loop to execute, the args list must have at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in the args list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `sep` is either the value from `kwargs['sep']` or a space, `file` is either the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time args has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in args**
