Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` has the 8th element of list `g` appended, `f[7]` is True. If the condition is satisfied, `l` will have the 8th element of list `g` appended. Otherwise, `n` is a value greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i`, `a[i]`, and `j` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration. `i` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, `j` is incremented by 1, and the value of `j` is appended to list `l`.***
