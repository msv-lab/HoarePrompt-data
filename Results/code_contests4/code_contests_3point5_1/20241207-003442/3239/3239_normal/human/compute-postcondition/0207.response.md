Example Answer:
Since this code snippet only appends the second element of the list `g` to the list `l`, the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g remain the same, and the second element of `g` is appended to `l`.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g remain the same, and the second element of `g` is appended to `l`**
