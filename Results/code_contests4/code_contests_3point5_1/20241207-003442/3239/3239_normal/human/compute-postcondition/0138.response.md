Example Answer:
`g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is the variable that was previously increased by 1. The value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only infer that `g[2]` now holds a value that is 1 more than the original value of `j`. Since `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `l` will also reflect this change. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[2]` holds a value that is 1 more than the original value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[2]` holds a value that is 1 more than the original value of `j`**
