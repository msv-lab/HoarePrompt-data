Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 17, `l` has the 8th element of list `g` appended and `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 19, `f[8]` is incremented by 1, `g[8]` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `f[8]`, the 9th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 19, then based on the conditions specified for divisibility by 23, 29, and 31, different elements of `f` and `g` are updated accordingly, `l` is appended with new values, and `i` is incremented.***
