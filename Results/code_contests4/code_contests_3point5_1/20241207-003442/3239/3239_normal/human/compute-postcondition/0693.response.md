Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the element at index 9 is true, `g` is a list containing 12 elements with the element at index 9 set to 1, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. `a[i]` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. `a[i]` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19. Additionally, `a[i]` is divisible by 23. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, then the element at index 10 in list `f` is true. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31, then `j` is updated based on the value of `f[11]`. If `f[11]` is true, then `j` is 0. If `f[11]` is false, then `j` is 1 and `g[11]` is updated to 1. `f[10]` is incremented by 1 if the if condition is true. If the else condition is true, `f[10]` is not incremented and `g[10]` is assigned the value 1.***
