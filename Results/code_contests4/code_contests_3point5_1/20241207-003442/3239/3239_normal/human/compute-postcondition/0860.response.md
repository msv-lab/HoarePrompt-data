Example Answer:
The function `func_8` is called with arguments `*l`, meaning the elements of `l` are unpacked and passed as arguments to the function. The function `func_8` will perform operations on the elements of `l` but since the specific implementation of the function is unknown, we cannot determine the exact impact on the variables `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is either an empty list or contains elements from `g` or `j` based on conditions, `f` and `g` are updated based on loop conditions, `j` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`l` is either an empty list or contains elements from `g` or `j` based on conditions, `f` and `g` are updated based on loop conditions, `j` is updated accordingly**
