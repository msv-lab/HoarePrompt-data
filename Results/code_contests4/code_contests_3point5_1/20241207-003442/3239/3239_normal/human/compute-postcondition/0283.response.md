Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If a[i] % 2 == 0, f[1] is incremented by 1. If a[i] % 3 == 0, f[2] is incremented by 1, and arrays a, f, l, g are adjusted based on divisibility conditions. If a[i] % 5 == 0, f[3] determines the state of arrays a, f, l, and g. If a[i] % 7 == 0, a[i] % 11 == 0, f[5] decides the adjustments in arrays a, f, l, and g. If a[i] % 13 == 0, f[6] condition determines the state of arrays a, f, l, and g. If a[i] % 17 == 0, f[7] is a factor in the adjustments of arrays a, f, l, and g. If a[i] % 19 == 0, a[i] % 23 == 0, a[i] % 29 == 0, a[i] % 31 == 0, the arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged.***
