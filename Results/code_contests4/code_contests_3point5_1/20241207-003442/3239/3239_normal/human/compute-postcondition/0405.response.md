Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` are in their initial state except `j` which is incremented by 1. List `f` contains 12 zeros except the last element which is incremented by 1. List `g` contains all zeros except the last element which is the value of `j`. Variable `l` contains the element at index 11 of list `g`. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, but is divisible by 31. If `f[10]` is true, `l` appends the value of `g[10]`. If `f[10]` is false, `l` is 1. `f[10]` is incremented by 1.***
