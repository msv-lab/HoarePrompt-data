Output State: **`l` is a list containing 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 7. The condition `f[4]` is false, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
