Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `l` is updated based on the conditions met. The values of `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are modified during each iteration. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[1]` is true, `l` has the value at index 1 of list `g` appended to it. Otherwise, `j` is appended to the list `l` and `g[1]` is equal to `j`.***
