Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will vary based on the divisibility conditions specified in the loop. The final state of these variables will be determined by the number of times each condition is met and the corresponding updates made to the lists `l`, `f`, and `g`. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain in their initial state as described.**
