Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `f[9]` is True, the value at index 9 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, variable `j` is increased by 1 and list `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.***
