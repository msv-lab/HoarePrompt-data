Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, so the list `l` will now contain the value of `j` that was increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `l` contains the new value of `j`**
