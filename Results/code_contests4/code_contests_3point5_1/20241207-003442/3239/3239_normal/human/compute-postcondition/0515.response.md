Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the 4th index of list `g`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, so after execution, the 4th index of list `g` holds the incremented value of `j`. The value of `l` which contains the new value of `j` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `g` contains the incremented value of `j` at index 4, variable `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `g` contains the incremented value of `j` at index 4, variable `l` contains the new value of `j`**
