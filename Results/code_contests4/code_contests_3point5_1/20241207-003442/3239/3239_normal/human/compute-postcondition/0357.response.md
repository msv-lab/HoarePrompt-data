Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 17. Additionally, the condition `f[7]` is true after entering the if statement. `l` appends the value of `g[7]`.**
