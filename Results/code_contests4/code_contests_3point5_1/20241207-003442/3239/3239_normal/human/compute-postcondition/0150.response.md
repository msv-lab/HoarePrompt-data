Example Answer: 
`g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is already incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is unknown, so the final value of `g[4]` is also unknown. The value of `l` containing the new incremented value of `j` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new incremented value of `j`, the value of `g[4]` is unknown.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new incremented value of `j`, the value of `g[4]` is unknown**
