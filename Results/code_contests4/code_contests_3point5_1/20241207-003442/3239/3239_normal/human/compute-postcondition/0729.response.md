Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the updated value of `j` will be added to the list `l`. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a list with the updated value of `j`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`l` is a list with the updated value of `j`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is incremented by 1**
