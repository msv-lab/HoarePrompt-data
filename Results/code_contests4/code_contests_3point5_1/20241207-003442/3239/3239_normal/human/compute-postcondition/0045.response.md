Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing one element with a value of 0 (value at index 4 of list `g`), `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5. When the if condition is met, `a[i]` is divisible by 7, and the value at index 4 of list `f` is True. If the condition is not met, `n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing the value of `j`, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
