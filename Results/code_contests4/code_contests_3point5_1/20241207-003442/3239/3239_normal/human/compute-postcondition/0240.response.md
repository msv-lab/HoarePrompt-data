Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned to the 6th index of the list `g`. The value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, the 6th index of list `g` will hold the value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`**
