Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` is now 2. Therefore, after execution, the list `l` will contain the values [2]. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is incremented by 1, `i`, `a` are in their initial state, `l` contains [2]**
