Postcondition: ***`l` is a list that may append the 5th element of list `g` or `j` based on the condition. `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each. `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. In the if part, `l` appends the 5th element of list `g`. In the else part, `l` appends the value of `j`. Additionally, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j` in the else part.***
