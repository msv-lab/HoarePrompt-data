Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the loop body conditions for the next iteration. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, the value at index 2 of list `g` is appended to list `l` if `f[2]` is True, otherwise variable `j` is increased by 1 and list `l` contains the new value of `j`. Additionally, if `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `f[3]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `f[6]` is increased by 1. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `f[8]` is increased by 1. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `f[9]` is increased by 1 and `l` may append the 10th element of list `g`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `l` may get updated based on the value of `f[10]`. If `f[10]` is true, the value at index 10 of list `g` is appended to list `l`, otherwise `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are increased by 1. If `a[i] % 29 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
