Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `n`, `i`, `a`, `f`, `g`, `j` are in their initial states. If the loop executes another time, `i` will be increased by 1 and the states of `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. `l` will have the value of `g[10]` appended to it if the condition `f[10]` is true. Otherwise, `l` appends `j` to its list and `g[10]` is set to `j`.***
