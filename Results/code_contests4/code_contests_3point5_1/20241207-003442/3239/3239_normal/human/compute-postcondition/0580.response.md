Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an empty list, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`l` is an empty list, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `j` is 0**
