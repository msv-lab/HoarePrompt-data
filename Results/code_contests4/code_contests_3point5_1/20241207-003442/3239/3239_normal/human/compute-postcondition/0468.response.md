Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If the loop executes another time, `i` will be increased by 1 and the states of `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If `f[9]` is True, `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`. If `f[9]` is False, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` have been updated, `j` is increased by 1 and appended to list `l`, `g[9]` is equal to the new value of `j`.***
