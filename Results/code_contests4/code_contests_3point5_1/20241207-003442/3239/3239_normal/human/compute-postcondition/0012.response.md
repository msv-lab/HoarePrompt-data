Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `sep` is either the value from `kwargs['sep']` or a space, `file` is either the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` remains False, for the loop to execute after the second time `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, `file.write(str(x))` has been executed, and `sep` has been written to the file if `at_start` is False.**
