Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 before being appended to list `l`. Since `j` was initially incremented by 1, the value being appended to `l` is the new incremented value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new incremented value of `j`**
