Example Answer:
`g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 2. If the initial value of `j` is `k`, then after execution, `j` becomes `k + 2`. Therefore, the value of `g[3]` is `k + 2`. The variable `l` contains the updated value of `j`, so `l` will also be `k + 2`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 2, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[3]` is `k + 2`**
