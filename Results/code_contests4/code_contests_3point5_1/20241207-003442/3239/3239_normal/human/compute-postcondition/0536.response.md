Example Answer:
`l` is appended with the 9th element of list `g`. The values of `n`, `f`, `j`, `i`, `a` are not affected. The output state is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration; `l` has the 9th element of list `g` appended.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration; `l` has the 9th element of list `g` appended**
