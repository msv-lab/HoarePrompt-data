Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is increased by 1 before appending it to the list `l`. Therefore, after execution, the list `l` will contain the incremented value of `j`. The value of `j` after increment is not provided, so the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
