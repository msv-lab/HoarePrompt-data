Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that `j` is increased by 1, the value of `j` after increment would be added to the list `l`. Therefore, after execution, the list `l` will contain the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; list `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
