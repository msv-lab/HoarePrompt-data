Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 3 and `f[2]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 2 of list `g`. If `f[2]` is false, `l` contains [1]. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 5, after execution `f` contains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` contains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1 and `l` contains [1]. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5, the state of the variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, and `a` remains unchanged, and further operations are carried out based on divisibility criteria.***
