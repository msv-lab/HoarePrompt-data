Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 23. Additionally, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 29. The condition `f[10]` is true. `l` appends the value of `g[10]`, so the value at index 10 of list `g` is appended to list `l`.
