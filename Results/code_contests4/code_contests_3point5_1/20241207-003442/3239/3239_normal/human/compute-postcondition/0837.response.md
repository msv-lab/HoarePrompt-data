Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` was increased by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` in the list `l` will be the increased value. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`**
