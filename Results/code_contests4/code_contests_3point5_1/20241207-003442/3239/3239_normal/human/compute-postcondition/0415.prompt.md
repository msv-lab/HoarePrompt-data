You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be  greater than 3**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time students_list is a list of students with at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute a third time students_list is a list of students with at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If `a[i]` is even and the second element of list `f` is True, `l` appends the second element of list `g` to it. If the first element of `f` is not True, `l` appends the incremented value of `j`, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[1]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not even, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 3 and `f[2]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 2 of list `g`. If `f[2]` is false, `l` contains [1]. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 5, after execution `f` contains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `g` contains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, and `l` contains [1]. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5, the state of the variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, and `a` remains unchanged, and further operations are carried out based on divisibility criteria.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
