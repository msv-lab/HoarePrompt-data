Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 11. The if condition `(f[5])` is true. The element at index 5 of list `g` is appended to list `l`.**
