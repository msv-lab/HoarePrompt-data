Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0. List `l` appends the value at index 2 of list `g` if `f[2]` is true. If `f[2]` is false, variable `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g[2]` holds a value that is 1 more than the original value of `j`. `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified.***
