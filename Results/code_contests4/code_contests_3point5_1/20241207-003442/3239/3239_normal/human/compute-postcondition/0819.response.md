Example Answer:
A value `j` which is increased by 1 is added to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is not given, so after execution, the list `l` will contain the value of `j` after incrementing by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
