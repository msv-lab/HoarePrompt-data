Example Answer:
`g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is one more than the initial value of `j`, so `g[5]` will hold the updated value of `j`. The list `l` contains the value `j+1`, but it is not directly affected by the assignment to `g[5]`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `g[5]` holds the updated value of `j`, list `l` contains the value `j+1`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `g[5]` holds the updated value of `j`, list `l` contains the value `j+1`**
