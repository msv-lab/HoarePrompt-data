Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is incremented by 1. Element `a[i]` is even. If the second element of list `f` is considered as true, `l` has appended the second element of list `g` to it. If the first element of `f` is not True, `l` appends the incremented value of `j` and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[1]` is increased by 1.**
