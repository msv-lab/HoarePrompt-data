Output State: **`l` is a list containing the element at index 1 of list `g` if the second element of list `f` is true. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the value of `j`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` and `g` are lists containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is even, `f[1]` is increased by 1.**
