Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned to the 3rd index of list `g`, which means `g` should be a list. The value of `j` is the previous value of `j` incremented by 1, and since the initial state mentions that `l` contains the new value of `j`, `l` should also be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is the previous value of `j` incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g` is a list where the 3rd index is the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is the previous value of `j` incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g` is a list where the 3rd index is the updated value of `j`**
