Example Answer:
`g` at index 11 is assigned the value of `j`, which is increased by 1. Therefore, `g` at index 11 now holds the increased value of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `g` at index 11 holds the increased value of `j`, arrays `a`, `f`, and `l` remain unchanged**
