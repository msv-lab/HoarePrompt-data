Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 12 zeros, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, a[i] is not divisible by 3, a[i] % 5 == 0, if f[3] is True, then `l` contains the value at index 3 of list `g` incremented by 1. If f[3] is False, then `l` is a list containing 1 and `g` is a list containing 12 zeros with the 4th element set to 1.**
