Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If a[i] is divisible by 31, the program will either append the value in index 11 of array g to array l if f[11] is true, or increment j by 1 and update the value at index 11 of array g with the increased value if f[11] is false. Arrays a, f, and l will remain unchanged after the execution of this if else block.***
