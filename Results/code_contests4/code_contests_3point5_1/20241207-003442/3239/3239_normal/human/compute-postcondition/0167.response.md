Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is appended to list `l`. The previous values of `j` and `l` are unknown, so after execution, the output state is: `n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, `j` is incremented by 1, and the value of `j` is appended to list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, `j` is incremented by 1, the value of `j` is appended to list `l`**
