Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` was increased by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` at this point is `j+1`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the list `l` will contain the value `j+1`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the value `j+1`**
