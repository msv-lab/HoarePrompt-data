Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If `f[4]` is True, the element at index 4 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `f[4]` is False, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. In both cases, `i` will be increased by 1 if the loop executes again, `a` remains unchanged. `f[4]` is increased by 1.**
