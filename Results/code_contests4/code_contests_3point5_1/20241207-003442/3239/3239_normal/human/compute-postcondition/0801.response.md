Example Answer:
`j` is appended to list `l`, which means the value of `j` is added to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that variable `j` is increased by 1, after execution, the value of `j` in the list `l` will be the incremented value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
