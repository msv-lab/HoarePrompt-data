Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The arrays `a`, `f`, and `g` remain unchanged. The output state is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
