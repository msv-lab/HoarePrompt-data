Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing the element at index 11 of list `g` if f[11] is True, otherwise `l` contains the updated list with the new value `j` appended to it, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, a[i] is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29, and a[i] is divisible by 31. If the if condition is met, the last element of list f is True. If the else condition is executed, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
