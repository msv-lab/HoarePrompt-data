Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 12 zeros, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, a[i] is not divisible by 3, a[i] is not divisible by 5, a[i] is not divisible by 7, a[i] is not divisible by 11, a[i] is not divisible by 13, a[i] is not divisible by 17. The element at index i in the list a is not divisible by 19. Additionally, a[i] is not divisible by 23. Also, after the if condition, a[i] is divisible by 29. The element at index 10 in the list f is True, `l` contains the element at index 10 from the list `g`.**
