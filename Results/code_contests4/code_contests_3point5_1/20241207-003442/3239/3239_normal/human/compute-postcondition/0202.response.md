Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, then the program checks for divisibility by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. Based on the divisibility of `a[i]` by these numbers, `f`, `l`, and `g` are updated accordingly for the next iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If not divisible by 11, then the program updates `l`, `f`, and `g` based on the divisibility conditions mentioned. If `f[6]` is true, `l` appends the value at index 6 of `g`. If `f[6]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, and `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`.***
