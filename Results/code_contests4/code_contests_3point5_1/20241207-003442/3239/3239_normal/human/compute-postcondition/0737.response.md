Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `f[6]` is true, the function will execute the if part, otherwise, it will execute the else part. If the if part is executed, all the mentioned updates will occur. If the else part is executed, `l` will have `j` appended, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is equal to `j`, `f[6]` is incremented by 1. In both cases, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`.***
