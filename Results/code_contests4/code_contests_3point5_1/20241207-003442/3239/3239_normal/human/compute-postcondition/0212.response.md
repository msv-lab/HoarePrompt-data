Example Answer:
The value of f[1] is incremented by 1. The previous values of other variables are not given, so the output state is: n is a value greater than 0, f[1] is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, f[1] is incremented by 1, all other variables remain unchanged**
