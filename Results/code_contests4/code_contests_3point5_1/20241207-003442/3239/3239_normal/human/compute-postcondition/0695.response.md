Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the 7th element is true and now incremented by 1 or set to true based on conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the 7th element is set to 1 and the 10th element is either 1 or 0 based on conditions, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the elements at indexes 9 and 10 in list `f` are updated based on conditions, and the state of the program varies depending on whether the if or else part is executed.***
