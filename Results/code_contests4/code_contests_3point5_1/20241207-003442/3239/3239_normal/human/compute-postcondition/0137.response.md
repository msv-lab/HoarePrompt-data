Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`, where `j` is increased by 1 before appending. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `l` will have the updated value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
