Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to list `l`. The previous values of `j` and `l` are not known, so after execution, `j` is added to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: Increment of `j` by 1 and adjustment of arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` based on divisibility, `j` is added to list `l`.
Output State: **Increment of `j` by 1 and adjustment of arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` based on divisibility, `j` is added to list `l`**
