Example Answer:
The value of `j` is assigned to the 6th index of list `g`. Since `j` was increased by 1 in the initial state, the value assigned to the 6th index of `g` is the incremented value of `j`. The value of `l` contains the new value of `j`, therefore `l` will also hold the incremented value of `j`. 
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, and the 6th index of list `g` is updated with the incremented value of `j`**
