Example Answer:
Since `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, after the execution of the code `l.append(j)`, the value of `j` (which has been increased by 1) will be appended to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`**
