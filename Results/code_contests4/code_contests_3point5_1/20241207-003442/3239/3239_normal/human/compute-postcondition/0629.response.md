Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing either a single element, which is the value at index 5 of list `g`, or containing 1. `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`. `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0. `g` is a list containing 12 elements, with index 5 set to 1 in the else part. `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the execution path. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 0. `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, but is divisible by 11. The 6th element in list `f` is either true or false based on the execution path.***
