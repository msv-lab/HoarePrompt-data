Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If the loop executes another time, `i` will be increased by 1. If `f[1]` evaluates to true, `l` appends the element at index 1 of list `g`. Otherwise, `j` is appended to list `l` and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
