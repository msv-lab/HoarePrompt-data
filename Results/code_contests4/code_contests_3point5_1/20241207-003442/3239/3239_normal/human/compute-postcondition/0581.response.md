According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `n` to be greater than 0, `i` to be 0, and `a` to be assigned a value from the function `func_4()`.
State: **`l` is an empty list, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
