Output State: **`l` is a list containing a single element which is the value of `g[9]`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` and `g` are lists containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. `a[i]` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. `a[i]` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19. Additionally, `a[i]` is divisible by 23. Moreover, `f[9]` evaluates to true**
