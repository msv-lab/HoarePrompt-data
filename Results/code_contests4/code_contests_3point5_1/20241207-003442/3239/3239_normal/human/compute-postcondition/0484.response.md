Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, the state of `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` will be updated based on the loop body conditions. If `f[9]` is True, the element at index 9 of list `g` will be appended to list `l`. If `f[9]` is False, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` will be modified, `j` will be increased by 1 and appended to list `l`, and `g[9]` will have the new value of `j`. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, the following conditions will be applied: if `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `f[10]` will be increased by 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, based on the condition of `f[11]` being True or False, the following changes occur: if `f[11]` is True, the element at index 11 of list `g` will be appended to list `l`. If `f[11]` is False, `i` will be increased by 1, `j` will be appended to list `l`, and `g` will have the value `j` at index 11. Additionally, the value at index 11 of list `f` will be increased by 1.***
