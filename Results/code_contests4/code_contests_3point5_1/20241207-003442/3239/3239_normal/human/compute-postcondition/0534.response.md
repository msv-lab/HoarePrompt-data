Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration. If `f[7]` is true, list `l` appends the element at index 7 of list `g`. If `f[7]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and list `l` contains the updated values of `j` which are used to assign to `g[7]`.***
