Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state does not provide information about the value of `j`, the size of list `l` increases by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, and the size of list `l` is increased by 1.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, and the size of list `l` is increased by 1**
