Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, the program evaluates the conditions for divisibility by 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. `l`, `f`, and `g` are updated based on the specified conditions for the next iteration. If `f[6]`, `l` appends the value at index 6 of `g`. If not `f[6]`, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, and `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`.***
