Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the value of `g[4]`, where `g` is a list. The value of `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `g[4]` is equal to the updated value of `j`, which is `j + 1`. The state of the variable `l` is not directly affected by this operation. 
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `g[4]` is equal to `j + 1`, `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
