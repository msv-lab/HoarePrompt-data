According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n`, `l`, `f`, and `j` remain in their initial state, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 0.
State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
