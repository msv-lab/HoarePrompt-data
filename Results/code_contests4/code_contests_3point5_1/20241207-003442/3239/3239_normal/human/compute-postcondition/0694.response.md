Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 1, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the value at index 8 is either incremented by 1 or set to true, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the value at index 8 is either 1 or 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions mentioned, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The elements at indexes `9` and `10` in list `f` are updated based on the conditions mentioned. If the if part executes, `l` will contain 1, `g[8]` will be 1 and the values of other elements in list `g` remain the same. If the else part executes, `l` will contain 1, `g[10]` will be 1 and the values of other elements in list `g` remain the same.***
