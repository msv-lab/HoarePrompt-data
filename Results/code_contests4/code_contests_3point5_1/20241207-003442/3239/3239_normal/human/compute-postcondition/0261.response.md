Example Answer:
The value at index 10 of array `g` is appended to array `l`. The values in arrays `a`, `f`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged**
