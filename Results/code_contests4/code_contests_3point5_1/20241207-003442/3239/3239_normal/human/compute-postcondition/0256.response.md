Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The values in arrays a, f, l, and g are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged**
