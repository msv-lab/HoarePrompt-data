Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros except for the 5th element which is now 1. `g` is a list containing 12 zeros except for the 5th element which is appended to list `l`. `j` is incremented by 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` remains unchanged. The condition `f[5]` is true, and the list `l` has been appended with the value of `j`.**
