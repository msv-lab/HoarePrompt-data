Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 12 zeros, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros where `f[10]` is incremented by 1, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, a[i] is not divisible by 3, a[i] is not divisible by 5, a[i] is not divisible by 7, a[i] is not divisible by 11, a[i] is not divisible by 13, a[i] is not divisible by 17, the element at index i in the list a is not divisible by 19, a[i] is not divisible by 23, and a[i] is divisible by 29. If `f[10]` is True, `l` contains the element at index 10 from the list `g`. If `f[10]` is not True, `l` contains the element at index 10 from the list `f`.**
