Example Answer:
`g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. Since the initial state of `j` is not provided, the updated value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
