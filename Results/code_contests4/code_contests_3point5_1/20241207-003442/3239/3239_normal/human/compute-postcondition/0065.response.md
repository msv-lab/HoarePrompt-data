Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 1 element which is 0, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros with `g[6]` assigned the value of 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, `a[i]` is not divisible by 7, `a[i]` is not divisible by 11, `a[i]` is divisible by 13. The condition `(f[6])` is true if the 7th element of f is true; otherwise, it is false.***
