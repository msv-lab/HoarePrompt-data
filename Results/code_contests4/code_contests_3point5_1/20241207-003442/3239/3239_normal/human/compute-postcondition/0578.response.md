Example Answer:
A list `f` containing 12 elements, all initialized to 0, is assigned to the variable `f`. The variable `l` is unaffected, and `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, which is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an empty list, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0.
Output State: **`l` is an empty list, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0**
