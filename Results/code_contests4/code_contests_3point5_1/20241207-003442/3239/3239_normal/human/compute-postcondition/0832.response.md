Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the 9th index of array `g`. Since the initial state of `j` is increased by 1, the new value of `j` is used which is `j + 1`. Therefore, `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j + 1`. The content of variable `l` is not affected. 
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j + 1`**
