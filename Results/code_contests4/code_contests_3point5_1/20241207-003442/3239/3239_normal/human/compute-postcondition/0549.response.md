Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` is increased by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is increased by 1, `i`, `a` remain the same.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is increased by 1, `i`, `a` remain the same**
