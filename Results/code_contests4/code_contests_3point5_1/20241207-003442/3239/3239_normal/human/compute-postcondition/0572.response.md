Output State: **The function `func_8` is called with the maximum value of list `l`. The final states of variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are determined by the divisibility conditions specified in the loop iterations. The lists `f` and `g` track the occurrences of divisibility conditions, while `l` contains updated values based on these conditions.**
