Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the 10th index of list `g`. The initial state of `n`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i` are not provided, so we cannot determine their values. However, we know that `l` appends `j` to its list. Therefore, the output state is: `l` appends `j` to its list, `g[10]` is `j`.
Output State: **`l` appends `j` to its list, `g[10]` is `j`**
