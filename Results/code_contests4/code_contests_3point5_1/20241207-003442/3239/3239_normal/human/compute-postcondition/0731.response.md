Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each. If `f[5]` is true, `l` appends the value of the 6th element of list `g`, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, 7th element of list `f` and 10th element of list `g` are updated, `j` is updated, and `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[5]` is false, `l` is a list with the updated value of `j`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
