Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If f[8] is true, arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged, and the value at index 8 of array g is appended to array l. If f[8] is false, arrays a, f, and g are adjusted based on divisibility, j is incremented by 1, l contains the new value of j, and g has the value 8 at index 8.***
