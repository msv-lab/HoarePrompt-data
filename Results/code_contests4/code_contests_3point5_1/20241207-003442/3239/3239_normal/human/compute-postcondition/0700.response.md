Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing either the value at index 3 in list `g` or the value at index 5 of list `g` or containing 1. `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`. `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the 7th element is true and now incremented by 1 or set to true based on conditions. `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the 7th element is set to 1 and the 10th element is either 1 or 0 based on conditions. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on conditions. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 0. `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, but is divisible by 13. The 6th element in list `f` is not True if the else part is executed, otherwise, it remains unchanged. `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[6]` is incremented by 1.***
