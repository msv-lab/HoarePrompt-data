Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If a[i] % 5 == 0, the state of arrays a, f, l, and g remains the same if f[3] is true. If f[3] is false, j is incremented by 1, a, f, and l remain the same, and g[3] is updated to the incremented value of j. If a[i] % 7 == 0, the arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on the divisibility conditions. If a[i] % 11 == 0 and f[5] is True, f[5] is incremented by 1, j is increased by 1, l contains the appended values of j, and g[5] is assigned the value of j. If a[i] % 13 == 0, and f[6] is True, arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on the divisibility conditions. If f[6] is False, the value of j is appended to list l. If a[i] % 17 == 0 and f[7] is true, the arrays a, f, l remain the same, and the value at index 7 of array g is appended to list l. If f[7] is false, the arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged, and the size of list l is increased by 1, with g[7] assigned the value of j. If a[i] % 19 == 0, a[i] % 23 == 0, a[i] % 29 == 0, and a[i] % 31 == 0, the arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged.***
