Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`. The values of `n`, `f`, `g` have been incremented by 1, while `i` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are updated by incrementing the value by 1, `i` and `a` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are updated by incrementing the value by 1, `i` and `a` remain unchanged**
