Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0. If `f[3]` is True, then `l` appends the value at index 3 of list `g`, `f`, `g` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `f[3]` is False, `j` is the previous value of `j` incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g` is a list where the 3rd index is the updated value of `j`.***
