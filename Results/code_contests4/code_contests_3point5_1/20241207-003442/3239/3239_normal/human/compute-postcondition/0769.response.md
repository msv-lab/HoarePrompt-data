Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each. `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated. `f[6]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
