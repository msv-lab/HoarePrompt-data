Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 12 zeros, `f` and `g` are lists containing 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. After the if condition, a[i] is divisible by 23. If the condition in the if part is true, then the value at index 9 of list `g` remains the same, otherwise, it is updated to the value of `j`.***
