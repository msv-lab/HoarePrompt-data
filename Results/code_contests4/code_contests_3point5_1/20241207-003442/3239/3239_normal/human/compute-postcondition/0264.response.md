Example Answer:
`j` is assigned to the 10th index of array `g`. The previous values of variables are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, values in arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are adjusted based on the divisibility of `a[i]` by certain numbers for the next iteration, and `j` is appended to `l`.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, values in arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are adjusted based on the divisibility of `a[i]` by certain numbers for the next iteration, and `j` is appended to `l`**
