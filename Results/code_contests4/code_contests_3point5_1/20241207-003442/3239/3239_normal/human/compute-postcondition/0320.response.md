Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is 1, after execution, `l` will now contain [1]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` contains [1].
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `l` contains [1]**
