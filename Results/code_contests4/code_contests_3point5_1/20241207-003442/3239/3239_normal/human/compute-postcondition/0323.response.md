Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1. `l` contains [1] if f[3] is true, otherwise `l` contains the element at index 3 of list `g`. After executing the code, the value at index 3 of list `f` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `f` now contains [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].**
