Example Answer:
The value of `j` is assigned to `g[11]`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to list `l`, the value of `j` before this code execution is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to list `l`, `g[11]` is updated with the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1 and appended to list `l`, `g[11]` is updated with the new value of `j`**
