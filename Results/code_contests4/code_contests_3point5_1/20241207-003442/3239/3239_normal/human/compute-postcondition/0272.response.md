Example Answer:
The value of f[11] is incremented by 1. If f[11] was true, then the value at index 11 of array g is appended to array l. If f[11] was false, then j is increased by 1 and the value of g at index 11 is updated with the increased value. Arrays a, f, and l remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, if f[11] was true, the value in index 11 of array g is appended to array l. If f[11] was false, j is increased by 1 and the value of g at index 11 is updated with the increased value. Arrays a, f, and l remain unchanged.**
