Example Answer:
`j` is added to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1, so after appending to the list, `l` will contain the incremented value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the updated list with the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` has the updated list with the new value of `j`**
