Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, `l` is updated based on the conditions met. The values of `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are modified during each iteration. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. `j` is incremented by 1.
