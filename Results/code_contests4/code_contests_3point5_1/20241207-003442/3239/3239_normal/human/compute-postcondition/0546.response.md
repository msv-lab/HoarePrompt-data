Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration. If `f[9]` is True, `l` appends the 10th element of list `g`. If `f[9]` is False, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are updated by incrementing the value by 1. `i` and `a` remain unchanged. Additionally, `g[9]` is equal to `j`.***
