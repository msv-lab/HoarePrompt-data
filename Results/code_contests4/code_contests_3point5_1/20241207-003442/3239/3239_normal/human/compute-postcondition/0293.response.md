Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, and `j` remain in their initial state, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, and `j` remain in their initial state, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0**
