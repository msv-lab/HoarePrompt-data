Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `l` is updated based on the conditions met. The values of `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are modified during each iteration. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[11]` is true, `l` is appended with the value at index 11 of list `g`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, and the value at index 11 of list `g` is also increased by 1.***
