Example Answer:
`g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is already increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `g[2]` will contain the new value of `j`. The list `l` will now contain the updated value of `j`. 
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the new value of `j`**
