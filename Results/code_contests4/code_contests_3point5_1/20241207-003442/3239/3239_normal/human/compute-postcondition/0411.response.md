Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` remain in their initial state. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 7, then `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros with the 4th element being 1, `j` is 1, and `l` contains `[1]`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7, then different conditions are checked and variables `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l` are updated based on various divisibility criteria.***
