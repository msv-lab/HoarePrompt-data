Example Answer: 
The value at index 1 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The values of `n`, `f`, `g`, and `i` are not affected. After execution, the value at index 1 of list `g` is added to list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, value at index 1 of list `g` is added to list `l**.
