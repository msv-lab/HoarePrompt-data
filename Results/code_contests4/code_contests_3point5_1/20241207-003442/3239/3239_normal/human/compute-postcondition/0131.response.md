Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of `j` and `l` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. `j` is increased by 1, and the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`**
