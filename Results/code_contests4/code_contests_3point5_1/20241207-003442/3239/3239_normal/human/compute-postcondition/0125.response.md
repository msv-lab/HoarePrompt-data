Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list with either one element containing the value at index 3 of list `g` incremented by 1 if a[i] % 5 == 0 and f[3] is True, or a list containing 1 and `g` is a list containing 12 zeros with the 4th element set to 1 if a[i] % 5 == 0 and f[3] is False. If a[i] % 5 != 0, `l` is either a list containing one element with a value of 0 or a list containing 12 zeros with the 6th element being the 6th element of list `g` if a[i] % 11 == 0 and the 6th element of list `f` is true. `f` is a list containing either 12 zeros with the 8th element incremented by 1 if a[i] % 17 == 0, or a list containing 13 zeros with the value at index 9 incremented by 1 if a[i] % 23 == 0. `g` is a list containing either 1 element which is 0 or the incremented value of `j`, where `j` is either 0 or 1. `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. If a[i] % 7 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 7 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 13 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 13 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 17 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 17 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 23 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 23 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part.***
