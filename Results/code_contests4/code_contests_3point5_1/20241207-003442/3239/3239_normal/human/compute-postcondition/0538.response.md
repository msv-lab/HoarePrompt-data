Example Answer: 
The code appends the value of `j` to the list `l`. Since `j` is updated by incrementing the value by 1, `l` will now contain the updated value of `j`. The other variables `n`, `f`, and `g` are not affected. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are updated by incrementing the value by 1, `i`, `a` remain unchanged, and `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are updated by incrementing the value by 1, `i`, `a` remain unchanged, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
