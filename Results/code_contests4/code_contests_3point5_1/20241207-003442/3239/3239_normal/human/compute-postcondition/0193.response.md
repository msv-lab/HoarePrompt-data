Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If f[11] is true, `g[11]` is appended to the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1 and appended to list `l`, `g[11]` is updated with the new value of `j`.***
