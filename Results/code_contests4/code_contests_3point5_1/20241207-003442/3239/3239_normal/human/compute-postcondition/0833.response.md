Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `l` is updated based on the conditions met. The values of `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are modified during each iteration. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[9]` is true, `l` is updated with the value of `g[9]` appended to it. If `f[9]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j + 1`.***
