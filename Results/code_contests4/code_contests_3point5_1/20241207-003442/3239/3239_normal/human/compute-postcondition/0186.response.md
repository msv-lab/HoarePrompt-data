Example Answer:
`g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is increased by 1. The value of `l` contains the incremented value of `j`. Therefore, after execution, `g[10]` contains the incremented value of `j`, `j` is increased by 1, and `l` contains the new incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`g[10]` contains the incremented value of `j`, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new incremented value of `j`**
