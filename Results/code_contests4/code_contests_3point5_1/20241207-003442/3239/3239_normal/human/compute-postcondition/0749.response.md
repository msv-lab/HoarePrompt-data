Postcondition: ***`l` is a list with an additional element which is the 9th element of list `g`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If the condition in the if statement is true, the program will be in this state. If the condition in the if statement is false, `l` is a list containing the updated value of `j`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
