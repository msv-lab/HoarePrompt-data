Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If a[i] % 23 == 0, arrays a, f, l remain unchanged, j is appended to list l, and g[9] is assigned the value of j. Otherwise, if a[i] is divisible by 29 and f[10] is false, values in arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on the divisibility of a[i] by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31 for the next iteration of the loop, and j is appended to l. If a[i] is divisible by 31 and f[11] is true, the program will append the value in index 11 of array g to array l. If f[11] is false, j is incremented by 1 and the value at index 11 of array g is updated with the increased value. Arrays a, f, and l will remain unchanged after the execution of this if else block.***
