Example Answer:
The value of `j` is added to the end of list `l`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are adjusted based on divisibility.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are adjusted based on divisibility**
