Example Answer:
`g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the value of `g[6]` will be the new value of `j` which is one higher than the initial value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is incremented by 1, `i`, `a` remain unchanged, `l` appends the value of `j`; `g[6]` is the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is incremented by 1, `i`, `a` remain unchanged, `l` appends the value of `j`; `g[6]` is the new value of `j`**
