Example Answer: 
The value in index 11 of array g is appended to array l. The values in arrays a, f, and g are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, g remain unchanged, and the value in index 11 of array g is appended to array l.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, g remain unchanged, and the value in index 11 of array g is appended to array l**
