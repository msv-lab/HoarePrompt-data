Output State: **`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If the condition `f[10]` is true, the 10th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If the condition `f[10]` is false, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[10]` is incremented by 1.**
