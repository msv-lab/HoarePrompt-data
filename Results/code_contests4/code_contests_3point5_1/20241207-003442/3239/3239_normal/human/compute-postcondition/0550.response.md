Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, so after execution, the list `l` will have the new value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is increased by 1, `i`, `a` remain the same, `l` now contains the value of `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is increased by 1, `i`, `a` remain the same, `l` now contains the value of `j`**
