Example Answer: 
`g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `g[5]` is the updated value of `j`. The state of `l` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[5]` is the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[5]` is the updated value of `j`**
