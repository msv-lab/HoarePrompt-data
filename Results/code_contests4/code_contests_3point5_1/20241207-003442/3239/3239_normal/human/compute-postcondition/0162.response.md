Example Answer:
`g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, `g[6]` will hold the incremented value of `j`. The state of other variables is not affected.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`**
