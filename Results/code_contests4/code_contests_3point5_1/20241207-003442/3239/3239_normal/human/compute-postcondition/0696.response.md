Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 1 if `f[6]` is true, otherwise `l` contains the value of `g[6]`. `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`. `f` is a list containing 12 elements where the 7th element is true and now incremented by 1 or set to true based on conditions. `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the 7th element is set to 1 and the 10th element is either 1 or 0 based on conditions. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on conditions. For the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. `a[i]` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 13. The element at index 6 in list `f` is not True if the else part is executed, otherwise, it remains unchanged. `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[6]` is incremented by 1.***
