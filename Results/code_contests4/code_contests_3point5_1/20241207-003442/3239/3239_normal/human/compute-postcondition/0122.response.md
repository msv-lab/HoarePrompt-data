Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing either 1 element which is 0 or the incremented value of `j`, `f` is a list containing either 12 zeros with the 8th element incremented by 1 if a[i] % 17 == 0 or a list containing 13 zeros with the value at index 9 incremented by 1 if a[i] % 23 == 0, `g` is a list containing either 1 element which is 0 or the incremented value of `j`, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. If a[i] % 13 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 13 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 17 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 17 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 23 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 23 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part.***
