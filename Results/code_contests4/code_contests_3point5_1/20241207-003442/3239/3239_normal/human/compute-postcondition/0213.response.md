Example Answer:
`l` appends the value at index 2 of array `g`. The values of arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged**
