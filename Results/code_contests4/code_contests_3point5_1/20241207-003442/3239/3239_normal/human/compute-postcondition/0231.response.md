Example Answer:
`l` appends the value of `g[5]`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on divisibility, and `l` appends the value of `g[5]`.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on divisibility, `l` appends the value of `g[5]`**
