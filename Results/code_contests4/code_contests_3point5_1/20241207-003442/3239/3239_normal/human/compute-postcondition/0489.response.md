Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, then based on the condition `f[4]` being True, the element at index 4 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `f[4]` is False, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. In both cases, `i` will be increased by 1. If `a[i] % 7 != 0`, then based on the condition `f[5]` being True, `i` will be increased by 1 and the states of `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l` will be updated. The value at index 5 of list `g` will be appended to `l`. If `f[5]` is False, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` will remain unchanged. `j` will be incremented by 1 and added to list `l`, while `g[5]` will be assigned the value of `j`. In the else part, if `f[9]` is True, the element at index 9 of list `g` will be appended to list `l`. If `f[9]` is False, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` will be modified. `j` will be increased by 1 and appended to list `l`, and `g[9]` will have the new value of `j`. Additionally, if `a[i] % 11 == 0`, further conditions related to the divisibility of `a[i]` by 29 and 31 along with the value of `f[11]` will determine the overall state of the program.***
