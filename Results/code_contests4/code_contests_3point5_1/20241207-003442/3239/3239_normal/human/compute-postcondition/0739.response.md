Example Answer:
The list `l` appends the 8th element of list `g`. The 8th element of `g` is now appended to `l`. The values of `l`, `a`, `f`, `g` remain the same except for the 8th element of `g` being appended to `l`. The 6th element of `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, and `f[6]` is incremented by 1. The loop executes one more time if `n` is greater than the current value of `i`.
Output State: **`l` has the 8th element of list `g` appended, `a`, `f`, `g` remain as they were, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`.**
