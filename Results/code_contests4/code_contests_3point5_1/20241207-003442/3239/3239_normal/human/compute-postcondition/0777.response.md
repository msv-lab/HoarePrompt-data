Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each. `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, `f[4]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `l` will append the 4th element of list `g` when `f[3]` is true, otherwise `l` will append `j`. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `g[3]` will be updated with the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, no changes occur. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `j` is incremented by 1, `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, and 8th element of list `f` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is true, the 10th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is false, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j` and `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 != 0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
