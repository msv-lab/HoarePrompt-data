Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`, but the values of `n`, `f`, `g`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are in their initial state, `i` will be increased by 1 in the next loop iteration, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to list `l`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are in their initial state, `i` will be increased by 1 in the next loop iteration, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is appended to list `l`**
