Example Answer:
The code appends the 10th element of list `g` to list `l`. The 10th element of list `g` is already updated, so it will be appended to list `l`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, and the 10th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`.
Output State: **`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, and the 10th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`**
