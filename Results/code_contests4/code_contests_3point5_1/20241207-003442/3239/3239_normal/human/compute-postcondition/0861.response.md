Output State: The final states of variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are determined based on the divisibility conditions specified in the loop. The lists `l`, `f`, and `g` will be updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution. The value of `j` will be updated according to the conditions. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain in their initial state.
