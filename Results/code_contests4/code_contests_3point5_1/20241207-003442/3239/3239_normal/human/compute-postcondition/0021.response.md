Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `sep` is either the value from `kwargs['sep']` or a space, `file` is either the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the last element in `args`, and `file.write(str(x))` has been executed for each element in `args`. The value of `kwargs` has 'end' removed and assigned to `file.write`, using '\n' as the default value if 'end' does not exist. Additionally, the 'flush' key has been removed from `kwargs` and its value evaluated to True***
