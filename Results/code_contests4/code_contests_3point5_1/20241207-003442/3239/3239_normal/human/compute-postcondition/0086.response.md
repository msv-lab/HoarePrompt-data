Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` contains 1, `f` is a list containing 13 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0 or 1 depending on the if condition, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 but divisible by 19. If the condition `f[8]` is true, then the state remains the same. If the condition `f[8]` is false, `j` is assigned to `g[8]` and `l` contains 1.**
