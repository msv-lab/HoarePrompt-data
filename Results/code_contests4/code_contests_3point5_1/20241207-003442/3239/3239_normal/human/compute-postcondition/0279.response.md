Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If a[i] % 11 == 0, `f[5]` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the appended values of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`. If a[i] % 13 == 0 and f[6] is True, arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on the divisibility of a[i] by specified numbers, and the value at index 6 of list g is appended to list l. If f[6] is False, the value of j is appended to list l. If a[i] % 17 == 0 and f[7] is true, the arrays a, f, l remain the same, and the value at index 7 of array g is appended to list l. If f[7] is false, the arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged, and the size of list l is increased by 1, with g[7] assigned the value of j. If a[i] % 19 == 0, the arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged. If a[i] % 23 == 0, arrays a, f, l remain unchanged, j is appended to list l, and g[9] is assigned the value of j. If a[i] is divisible by 29 and f[10] is false, values in arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on the divisibility of a[i] by specified numbers, and j is appended to l. If a[i] is divisible by 31 and f[11] is true, the program will append the value in index 11 of array g to array l. If f[11] is false, j is incremented by 1, and the value at index 11 of array g is updated with the increased value. Arrays a, f, and l will remain unchanged after the execution of this if else block.***
