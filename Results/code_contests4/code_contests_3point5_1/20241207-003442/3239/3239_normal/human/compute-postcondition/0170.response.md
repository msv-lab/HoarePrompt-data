Example Answer:
The value of the 8th element of list `f` is incremented by 1. The previous state of the variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i`, `a`, and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a value greater than 0, `l` has the 8th element of list `g` appended, `f[7]` is True, `f[7]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` has the 8th element of list `g` appended, `f[7]` is incremented by 1**
