Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 12 zeros, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, and a[i] is not divisible by 3, a[i] is not divisible by 5, a[i] is not divisible by 7. After entering the if condition, a[i] is divisible by 11, the 6th element of list `f` evaluates to true, `l` contains the 6th element of list `g`.**
