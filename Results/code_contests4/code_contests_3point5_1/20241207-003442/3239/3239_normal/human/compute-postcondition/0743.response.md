Postcondition: ***`l` is a list. If `f[7]` is true, the 8th element of list `g` is appended to `l`, `a`, `f`, `g` remain unchanged, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[7]` is false, `l` has an additional element `j`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, 7th element of list `g` is assigned the updated value of `j`.***
