Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration. If `f[4]` is true, `l` has appended the 5th element of list `g`. If `f[4]` is false, variable `j` is increased by 1, list `g` contains the incremented value of `j` at index 4, and variable `l` contains the new value of `j`.***
