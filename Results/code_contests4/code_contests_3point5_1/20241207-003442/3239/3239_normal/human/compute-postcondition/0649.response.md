Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing one element which is the 8th element of list `g`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0 where the 7th element is true, `g` is a list containing 12 elements where the 7th element is set to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. `a[i]` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. After the if condition, `a[i]` is divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 17***
