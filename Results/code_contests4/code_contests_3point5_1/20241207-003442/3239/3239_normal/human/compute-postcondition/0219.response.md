Example Answer:
`l` appends the value at index 3 of array `g`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged except for the appending operation to `l`.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged except for the appending operation to `l`.**
