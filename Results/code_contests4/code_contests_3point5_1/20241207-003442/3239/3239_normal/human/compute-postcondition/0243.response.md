Example Answer:
Since we are only appending the value of g at index 7 to list l, the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l remain the same, and the value at index 7 of array g is appended to list l.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l remain the same, and the value at index 7 of array g is appended to list l**.
