Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is either a list containing 12 zeros or a list containing 1, `f` is a list containing 13 zeros with the value at index 9 incremented by 1 if a[i] % 23 == 0, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros with the value at index 9 either remaining the same or updated to the value of `j`, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. If a[i] % 19 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 19 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part.***
