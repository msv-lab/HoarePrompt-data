Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 19. The condition `(f[8])` evaluates to False. `j` is appended to the list `l`.**
