According to the code, the loop execution depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the final states of variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will vary based on the divisibility conditions specified in the loop execution of `func_8(max(l))`. The number of times each condition is met and the corresponding updates made to the lists `l`, `f`, and `g` will determine the final state of these variables. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain in their initial state. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
