Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the value of `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, the updated value of `j` is added to the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated value of `j`**
