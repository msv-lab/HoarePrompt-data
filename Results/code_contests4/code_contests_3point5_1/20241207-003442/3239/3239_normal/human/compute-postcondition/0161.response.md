Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and then `j` is appended to the list `l`. The initial state does not mention the initial value of `l`, so after execution, `l` will contain the incremented value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`**
