Example Answer:
The value of `j` has been appended to the list `l`, so now `l` contains the value of `j`. The code assigns the value of `j` to the index 3 of list `g`. The previous values of `n`, `f`, `g`, `i`, and `a` are unknown and not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state and the value of `j` has been appended to the list `l`, and `g[3]` is now equal to `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state and the value of `j` has been appended to the list `l`, and `g[3]` is now equal to `j`.**
