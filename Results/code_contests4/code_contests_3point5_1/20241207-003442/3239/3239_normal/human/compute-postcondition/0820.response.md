Example Answer: 
`g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the value of `g[7]` is also unknown. `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, but since the previous value of `j` is unknown, the value of `l` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[7]` is unknown.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[7]` is unknown**
