Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `l` appends the value at index 2 of list `g` if `f[2]` is true. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `g[2]` holds a value that is 1 more than the original value of `j`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, the program checks for divisibility by 5. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5 and `f[3]` is True, `l` appends the value at index 3 of list `g`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 5 and `f[3]` is False, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, and `g` is a list where the 3rd index is the updated value of `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 5, the program checks for divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. Based on the divisibility of `a[i]` by these numbers, `f`, `l`, and `g` are updated accordingly for the next iteration. If `a[i]` is divisible by 7, `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is divisible by 11, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `f[6]` is true, `l` appends the value at index 6 of `g`. If `f[6]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, and `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`.***
