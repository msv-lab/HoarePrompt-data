Postcondition: ***`a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are modified during each iteration. `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[10]` is True, `l` appends the element at index 10 of list `g`. If `f[10]` is False, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, and `g[10]` is assigned the new value of `j`.***
