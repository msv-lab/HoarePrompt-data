Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0. If `a[i]` is divisible by 13, `l` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `f` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `g` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `f[6]`, `l` appends the value at index 6 of `g`. If not `f[6]`, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 13, the program evaluates the conditions for divisibility by 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31, updating `l`, `f`, and `g` accordingly, and incrementing `i` as necessary.***
