Example Answer:
The value of `g[10]` is appended to the list `l`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state is: `n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, and `g[10]` has been appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, `g[10]` has been appended to the list `l`**
