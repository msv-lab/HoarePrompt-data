Example Answer:
`g[11]` is assigned the value of `j` which is increased by 1 and added to the list `l`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but `l` now contains the incremented value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1 and added to list `l`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1 and added to list `l`**
