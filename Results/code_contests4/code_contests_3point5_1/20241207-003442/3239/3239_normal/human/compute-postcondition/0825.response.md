Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and then the value of `j` is appended to list `l`. Since the initial value of `j` is unknown, we can only say that `j` has been incremented by 1 and added to list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, elements in list `l` will depend on the initial value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, elements in list `l` will depend on the initial value of `j`**
