Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on divisibility. If f[5] is true, `l` appends the value of `g[5]`. If f[5] is false, `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are adjusted for the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the appended values of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
