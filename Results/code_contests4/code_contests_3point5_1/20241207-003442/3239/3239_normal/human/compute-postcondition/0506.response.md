Example Answer:
`l` is appended with the value at index 3 of the list `g`. The previous values of `l` and `g` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `f`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration; `l` has a new value appended from index 3 of list `g`.
Output State: **`n`, `f`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration; `l` has a new value appended from index 3 of list `g`**
