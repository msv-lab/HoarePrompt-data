Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, `l` appends 0, otherwise `n`, `f`, `g` remain in their initial state. `j` is incremented by 1, `l` has `j` appended to it, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, divisible by 13, `g[6]` is equal to the new value of `j`.**
