Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If f[1] is True, the value at index 1 of list `g` is added to list `l`. If f[1] is False, `j` is increased by 1, the value of `j` is appended to list `l`, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
