Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` is increased by 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i`, `a` are unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i`, `a` are unchanged**
