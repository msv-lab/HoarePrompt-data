Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `l` is a list. If the condition `f[2]` is true, then `l` contains an additional element which is the 3rd element of list `g`. The lists `a`, `f`, `g` contain 12 elements each. `j` is updated. The 7th element of list `f` is updated. The 10th element of list `g` is updated. The 6th element of list `f` is updated. `g[6]` is updated. `f[6]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If the condition `f[2]` is false, then `l` contains elements including `j`. The lists `a`, `f`, `g` contain 12 elements each. `j` is updated. The 7th element of list `f` is updated. The 10th element of list `g` is updated. The 6th element of list `f` is updated. `g[6]` is updated. `f[6]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. Additionally, `j` is updated and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[2]` has been incremented by 1.**
