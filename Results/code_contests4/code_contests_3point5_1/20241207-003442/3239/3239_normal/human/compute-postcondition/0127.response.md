Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list with either one element 0 or 12 zeros with the 6th element being the 6th element of list `g` if a[i] % 11 == 0 and the 6th element of list `f` is true. `f` is a list with either 12 zeros with the 8th element incremented by 1 if a[i] % 17 == 0 or 13 zeros with the value at index 9 incremented by 1 if a[i] % 23 == 0. `g` is a list with either 1 element 0 or the incremented value of `j`, where `j` is either 0 or 1. `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `a[i]` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. If a[i] % 7 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 7 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 13 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 13 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 17 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 17 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 23 == 0, the state is updated as described in the if part. If a[i] % 23 != 0, the state is updated as described in the else part. If a[i] % 3 == 0, `l` is 0, `f` has the 3rd element set to 1, and `g` remains as a list of 12 zeros. Otherwise, `l` is updated based on the conditions specified in the else part.***
