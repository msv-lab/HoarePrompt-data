Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros with index 2 assigned the value 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even and divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 2 of list `g`. If `f[2]` is false, `l` contains [1].***
