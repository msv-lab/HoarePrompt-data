Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration. If the 5th element of list `f` is true, then the 5th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `g[5]` holds the updated value of `j`, and list `l` contains the value `j+1`.***
