Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `f[6]`, `l` appends the value at index 6 of `g`. If not `f[6]`, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`.***
