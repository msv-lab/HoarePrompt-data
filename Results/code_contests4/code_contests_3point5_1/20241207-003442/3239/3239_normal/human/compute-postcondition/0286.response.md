Output State: The final state of variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will vary based on the divisibility conditions specified in the loop execution of `func_8(max(l))`. The number of times each condition is met and the corresponding updates made to the lists `l`, `f`, and `g` will determine the final state of these variables. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain in their initial state.
