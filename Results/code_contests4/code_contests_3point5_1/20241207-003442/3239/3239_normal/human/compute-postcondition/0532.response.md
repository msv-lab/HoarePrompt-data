Example Answer: 
`j` is appended to the list `l`, so after execution, the list `l` will contain the updated values of `j`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, list `l` now contains the updated values of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, list `l` now contains the updated values of `j`**
