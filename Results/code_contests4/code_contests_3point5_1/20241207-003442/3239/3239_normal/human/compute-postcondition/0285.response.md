Output State: **The values of `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` will vary based on the divisibility conditions specified in the loop execution of `func_8(max(l))`. The final state of these variables will be determined by the number of times each condition is met and the corresponding updates made to the lists `l`, `f`, and `g`. If the loop does not execute, the variables will remain in their initial state as described.**
