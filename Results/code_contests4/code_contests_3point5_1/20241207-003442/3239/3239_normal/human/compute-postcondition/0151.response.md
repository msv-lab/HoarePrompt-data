Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `f[4]` is true, `g[4]` is appended to list `l`. If `f[4]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new incremented value of `j`, and the value of `g[4]` is unknown.***
