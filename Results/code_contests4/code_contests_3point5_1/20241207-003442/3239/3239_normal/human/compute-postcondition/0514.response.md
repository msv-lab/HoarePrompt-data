Example Answer:
A value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, where `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`**
