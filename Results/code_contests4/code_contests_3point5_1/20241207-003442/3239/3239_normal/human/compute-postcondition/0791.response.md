Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `l` is updated based on the conditions met. The values of `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are modified during each iteration. If `f[2]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 2 of list `g`. If `f[2]` is false, `l` is updated with the appended value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `g[2]` is equal to the new value of `j`.***
