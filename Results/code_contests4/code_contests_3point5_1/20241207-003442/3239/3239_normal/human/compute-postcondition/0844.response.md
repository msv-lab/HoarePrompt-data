Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is assigned to index 11 of the list `g`. Since `j` was increased by 1 in the initial state, the value stored at index 11 of list `g` will be the updated value of `j`. The list `l` contains the updated values of `j`, so after executing the code, both `j` and the value at index 11 of list `g` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, value at index 11 of list `g` is also increased by 1.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j`, value at index 11 of list `g` is also increased by 1**
