Example Answer:
`g[4]` is appended to the list `l`. The specific value of `g[4]` is unknown as the initial state of `g` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, `g[4]` is appended to list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, updated `l`, `f`, `g` based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified, `g[4]` is appended to list `l`**
