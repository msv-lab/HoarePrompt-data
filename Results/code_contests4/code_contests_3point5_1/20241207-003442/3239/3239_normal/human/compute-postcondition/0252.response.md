Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `8` to the 8th index of array `g`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, and `g` are adjusted based on divisibility, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g` has the value `8` at index 8.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, and `g` are adjusted based on divisibility, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`, `g` has the value `8` at index 8**
