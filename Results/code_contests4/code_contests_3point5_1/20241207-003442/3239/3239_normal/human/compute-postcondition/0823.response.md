Example Answer:
`l` is appended with the value at index 8 of the list `g`. The other variables `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` may have been modified during each iteration, but their values are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is appended with the value at index 8 of list `g`.
Output State: **`l` is appended with the value at index 8 of list `g`**
