Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing one element which is the value at index 10 of list `g`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `g` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. `a[i]` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 13. `a[i]` is not divisible by 17. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19. Additionally, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23. Also, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 29. If the if condition is true, the element at index 10 in list `f` is true. If the else condition is true, the element at index 10 in list `f` is not true and `g[10]` is assigned the value 1.***
