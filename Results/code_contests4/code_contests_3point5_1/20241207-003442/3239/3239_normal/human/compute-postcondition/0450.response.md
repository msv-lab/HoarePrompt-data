Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If the loop executes another time, `i` will be increased by 1. In the if part, `l` will have the 7th element of list `g` appended to it. `a`, `f`, `g`, and `j` remain unchanged. In the else part, `j` is appended to the list `l` and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
