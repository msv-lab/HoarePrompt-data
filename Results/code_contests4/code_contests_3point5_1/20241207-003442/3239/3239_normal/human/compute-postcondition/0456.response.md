Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If the loop executes another time, `i` will be increased by 1. If `f[7]` is True, `l` will have the value at index 7 of list `g` appended to it. If `f[7]` is False, `j` is increased by 1 and `l` will have the value of `j` appended to it. `g[7]` will be assigned the value of `j` in both cases.***
