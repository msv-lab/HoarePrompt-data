Example Answer:
The value at index 7 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The values of `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are not affected, and the loop continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is updated with the value at index 7 of list `g`.
Output State: **`l` is updated with the value at index 7 of list `g`**
