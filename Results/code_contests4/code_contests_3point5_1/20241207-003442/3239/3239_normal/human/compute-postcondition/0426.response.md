Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If the loop executes another time, `i` will be increased by 1. If `f[2]` is True, `l` will have the value of the third element in list `g` appended to it. If `f[2]` is False, `n`, `l`, `f`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i`, `a` are in their initial state, `l` contains [2], `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
