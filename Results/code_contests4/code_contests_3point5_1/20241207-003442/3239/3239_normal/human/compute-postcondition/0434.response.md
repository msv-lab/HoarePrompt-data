Example Answer: 
The code appends the element at index 4 of list `g` to list `l`. The states of `n`, `f`, `j`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state, with the element at index 4 of list `g` appended to list `l`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state, with the element at index 4 of list `g` appended to list `l`**
