Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` remain in their initial state. For the if part, if the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 23, `f[9]` is true, `l` contains a single element which is 0. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 23, `f[9]` is false, `g[9]` is 1, and `f[9]` is increased by 1. For the else part, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` are in their initial state except `j` is incremented by 1, list `f` contains 12 zeros except the last element which is incremented by 1, list `g` contains all zeros except the last element which is the value of `j`, `l` contains the element at index 11 of list `g`, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, but is divisible by 31. If `f[10]` is true, `l` appends the value of `g[10]`. If `f[10]` is false, `l` is 1, and `f[10]` is incremented by 1.***
