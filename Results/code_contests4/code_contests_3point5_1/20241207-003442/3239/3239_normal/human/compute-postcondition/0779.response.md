Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `l` is a list containing various elements based on the conditions met. If `a[i] % 2 == 0`, `l` will contain the 2nd element of list `g` and `g[1]` will be assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 3 == 0` and `f[2]` is true, `l` will have an additional element which is the 3rd element of list `g`. If `a[i] % 3 == 0` and `f[2]` is false, `l` will contain elements including `j`. If `a[i] % 3 != 0` and `f[3]` is true, `l` will append the 4th element of list `g`, otherwise `l` will append `j`. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `g[3]` will be updated with the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `f[7]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `j` is incremented by 1, `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, and 8th element of list `f` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is true, the 10th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is false, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j` and `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 29 != 0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `a[i] % 19 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
