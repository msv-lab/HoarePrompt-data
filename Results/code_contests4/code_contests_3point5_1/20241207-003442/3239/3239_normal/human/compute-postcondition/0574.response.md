According to the code, the loop execution depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, the final states of variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are determined based on the divisibility conditions. So for the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0, resulting in adjusted states of `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` based on the divisibility conditions.
State: **The return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0, resulting in adjusted states of variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` based on the divisibility conditions**
