Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the loop body conditions for the next iteration. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `f[9]` is incremented by 1 and `l` may append the 10th element of list `g` based on the value of `f[9]`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, based on the value of `f[10]`, the list `l` may get updated. If `f[10]` is True, the value at index 10 of list `g` is appended to list `l`, otherwise `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are increased by 1. If `a[i] % 29 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
