Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, then `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 3 != 0`, based on the divisibility by 5, the value at index 3 of list `g` is appended to list `l`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `a[i] % 5 != 0`, the states of `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, and `a` will be updated according to the conditions specified by `f` and the divisibility by 7, 9, 11, 29, and 31.***
