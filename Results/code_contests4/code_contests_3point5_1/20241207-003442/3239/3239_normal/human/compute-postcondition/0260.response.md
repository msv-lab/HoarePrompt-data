Example Answer:
The value of f[9] is incremented by 1. The previous value of f[9] is unknown, so after execution, the value at index 9 in array f is increased by 1. The arrays a, f, and l remain unchanged. j is appended to the list l, and g[9] is assigned the value of j. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l remain unchanged, j is appended to list l, and g[9] is assigned the value of j.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays a, f, l remain unchanged, j is appended to list l, and g[9] is assigned the value of j**
