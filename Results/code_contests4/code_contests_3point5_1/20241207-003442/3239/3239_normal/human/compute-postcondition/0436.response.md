Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, and then it is appended to the list `l`. The other variables `n`, `f`, `g`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g` are in their initial state, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` will be increased by 1 if the loop executes again, `a` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g` are in their initial state, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` will be increased by 1 if the loop executes again, `a` remains unchanged**
