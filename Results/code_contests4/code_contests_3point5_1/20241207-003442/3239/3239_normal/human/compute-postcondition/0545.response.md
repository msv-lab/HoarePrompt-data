The value of `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` incremented by 1, `i` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are updated by incrementing the value by 1, `i` and `a` remain unchanged, `g[9]` is equal to `j`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are updated by incrementing the value by 1, `i` and `a` remain unchanged, `g[9]` is equal to `j`**
