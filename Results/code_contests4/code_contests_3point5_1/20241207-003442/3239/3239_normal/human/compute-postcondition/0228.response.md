Example Answer: 
`g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` has been previously incremented by 1. Therefore, `g[4]` now holds the incremented value of `j`. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0; `j` is incremented by 1; `l` contains the updated values of `j`; `g[4]` holds the incremented value of `j`**
