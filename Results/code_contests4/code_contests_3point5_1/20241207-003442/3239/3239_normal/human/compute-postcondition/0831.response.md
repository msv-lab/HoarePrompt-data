Example Answer:
`j` is appended to list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1, so the new value of `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`**
