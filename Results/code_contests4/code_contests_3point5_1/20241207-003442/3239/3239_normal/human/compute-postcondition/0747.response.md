Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` is updated, so the updated value of `j` is added to the list `l`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list containing the updated value of `j`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`l` is a list containing the updated value of `j`, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is incremented by 1**
