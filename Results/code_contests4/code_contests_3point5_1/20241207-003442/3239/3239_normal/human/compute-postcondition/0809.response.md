Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `l` is updated based on the conditions met. The values of `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are modified during each iteration. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[5]` is true, `l` appends the element at index 5 of list `g`. If `f[5]` is false, variable `j` is increased by 1, and list `l` contains the updated value of `j`.***
