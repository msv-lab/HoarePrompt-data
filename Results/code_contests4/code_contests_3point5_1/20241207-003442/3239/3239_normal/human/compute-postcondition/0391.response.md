Output State: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 1, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, but divisible by 29. The condition `(f[10])` is false. `l` now contains the value 1. `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, so after execution, `g` will have 11 zeros and a single 1.
