Example Answer:
The value at index 5 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The values of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration, the 5th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body for the next iteration, the 5th element of list `g` is appended to list `l`**
