Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`. As `j` is incremented by 1, the new list `l` will have the updated value of `j`. The other variables `n`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are incremented by 1, while `i` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i`, `a` are unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are incremented by 1, `i`, `a` are unchanged**
