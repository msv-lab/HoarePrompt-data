Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` and `g` are lists containing 12 zeros each. `j` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 5. The condition `f[3]` is true. `l` contains the element at index 3 of list `g`.**
