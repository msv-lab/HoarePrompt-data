Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing one element which is the value at index 3 in list `g`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_4()`, `f` is a list containing 12 elements all initialized to 0, `g` is a list where the element at index 3 is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 5. Depending on the condition, the program state will change accordingly after the if else block executes.***
