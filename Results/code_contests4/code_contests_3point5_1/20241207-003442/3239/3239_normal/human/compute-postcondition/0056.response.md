Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 12 zeros, `f` has its 6th element incremented by 1, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, a[i] is not divisible by 2, a[i] is not divisible by 3, a[i] is not divisible by 5, a[i] is not divisible by 7, a[i] is divisible by 11. If the 6th element of list `f` is true, `l` contains the 6th element of list `g`. Otherwise, `l` contains 1.**
