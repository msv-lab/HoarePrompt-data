Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `f[5]` is true, `g[5]` is appended to `l`. If `f[5]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g[5]` is updated to the value of `j`.***
