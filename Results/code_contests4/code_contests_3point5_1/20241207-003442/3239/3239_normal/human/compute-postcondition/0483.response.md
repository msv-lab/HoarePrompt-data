Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `f[10]` is increased by 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, based on the condition of `f[11]` being True or False, the following changes occur: if `f[11]` is True, `l` appends the element at index 11 of list `g`. If `f[11]` is False, `i` is increased by 1, `l` appends `j` to its existing list, and `g` now has the value `j` at index 11. Additionally, after the execution of the code, the value at index 11 of list `f` is increased by 1.***
