Postcondition: ***`n` is a value greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g` are updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` meets the divisibility conditions specified. If `a[i]` is divisible by 29, `f[10]` is true, `g[10]` is appended to the list `l`. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 29, `f[10]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and the new value of `j` is appended to `l`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 31 in the else part, `f[11]` is incremented by 1.***
