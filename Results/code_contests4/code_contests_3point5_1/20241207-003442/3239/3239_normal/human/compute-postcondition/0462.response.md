Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If `f[8]` is True, `l` has the value at index 8 of list `g` appended to it. If `f[8]` is False, `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are increased by 1, `i`, `a` are in their initial state. If the loop executes another time, `i` will be increased by 1 and the states of `a`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and `l` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If `f[8]` is False, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
