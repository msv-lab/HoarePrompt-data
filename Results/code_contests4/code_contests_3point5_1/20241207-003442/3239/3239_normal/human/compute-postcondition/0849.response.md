Postcondition: ***`l`, `a`, `g`, `f`, `j` are variables modified during each iteration. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, the value at index 9 of list `f` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, the value at index 10 of list `f` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, the value at index 11 of list `f` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute one more time if `n` is greater than the current value of `i`.***
