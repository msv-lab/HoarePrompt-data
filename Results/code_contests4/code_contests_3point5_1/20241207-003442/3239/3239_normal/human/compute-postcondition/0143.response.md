Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 before appending it to the list `l`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `l`, we can assume `l` is an empty list. After executing the code, `j` is appended to the list `l`, so the list `l` will now contain the value of `j` which is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the new value of `j`**
