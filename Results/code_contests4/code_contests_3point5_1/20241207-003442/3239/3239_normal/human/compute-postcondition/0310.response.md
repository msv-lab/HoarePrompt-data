Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`, so after execution, `l` will contain `[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 3. The element at index 2 in list `f` is False, and `l` contains `[1]`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `j` remain in their initial state, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0.
