Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous values of `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` are unknown. The code appends the value of `j` to list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` are in their initial state, `j` is incremented by 1 and added to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i` are in their initial state, `j` is incremented by 1 and added to the list `l`**
