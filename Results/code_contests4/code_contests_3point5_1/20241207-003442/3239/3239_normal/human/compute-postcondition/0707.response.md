Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[1]` is true, `l` now contains the 2nd element of list `g`. If `f[1]` is false, `l` contains the updated value of `j` and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
