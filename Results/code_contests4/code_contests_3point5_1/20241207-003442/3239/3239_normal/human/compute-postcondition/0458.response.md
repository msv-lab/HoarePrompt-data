Example Answer:
The code appends the value at index 8 of list `g` to list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state, and `l` has the value at index 8 of list `g` appended to it.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state, `l` has the value at index 8 of list `g` appended to it**
