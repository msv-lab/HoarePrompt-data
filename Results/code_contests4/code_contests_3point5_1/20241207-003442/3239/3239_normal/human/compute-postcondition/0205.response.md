Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If a[i] is divisible by 2, f[1] is increased by 1. Otherwise, if a[i] is not divisible by 2, the program checks for divisibility by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. Based on the divisibility of a[i] by these numbers, f, l, and g are updated accordingly for the next iteration. If a[i] is divisible by 3, l appends the value at index 2 of list g if f[2] is true. If a[i] is divisible by 5 and f[3] is True, l appends the value at index 3 of list g. If a[i] is divisible by 5 and f[3] is False, j is incremented by 1, l contains the new value of j, and g is updated accordingly. If a[i] is divisible by 7, f[4] is incremented by 1. If a[i] is divisible by 11, f[5] is incremented by 1. If f[6] is true, l appends the value at index 6 of g. If f[6] is false, j is incremented by 1, l contains the incremented value of j, and g[6] holds the incremented value of j.***
