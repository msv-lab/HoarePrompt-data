The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` is unknown as it is not given in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state and the value of `j` has been appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `i`, `a` are in their initial state and the value of `j` has been appended to the list `l`**
