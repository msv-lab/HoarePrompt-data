Postcondition: ***n is a value greater than 0. If f[10] is true, arrays a, f, l, and g remain unchanged. If f[10] is false, values in arrays a, f, l, and g are adjusted based on the divisibility of a[i] by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31 for the next iteration of the loop, and j is appended to l.***
