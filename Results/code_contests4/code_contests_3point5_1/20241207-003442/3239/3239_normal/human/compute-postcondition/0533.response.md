Example Answer:
`g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is increased by 1. The updated value of `j` is used to assign to `g[7]`. The initial state of `j` is not provided, so the output state is: `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j` which is used to assign to `g[7]`.
Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated values of `j` which is used to assign to `g[7]`**
