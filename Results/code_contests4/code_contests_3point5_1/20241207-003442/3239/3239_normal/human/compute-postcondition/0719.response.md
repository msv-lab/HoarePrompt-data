Postcondition: ***`l` is a list. If `f[3]` is true, the 4th element of list `g` is appended to `l`, `a`, `f`, `g` remain the same, `j` is updated, 7th element of list `f` is updated, 10th element of list `g` is updated, 6th element of list `f` is updated, `g[6]` is updated, `f[6]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`. If `f[3]` is false, `l` is a list with `j` appended, `a`, `f`, `g` contain 12 elements each with specific updates, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`, `j` is updated, `g[3]` is updated with the value of `j`.***
