Output State: **`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` remain in their initial state. `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, but divisible by 31. The condition `f[11]` is still false.**
