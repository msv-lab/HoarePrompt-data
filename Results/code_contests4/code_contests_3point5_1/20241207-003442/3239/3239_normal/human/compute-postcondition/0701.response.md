Postcondition: ***`l` is a list, `a`, `f`, `g` are lists containing 12 elements each, `j`, `n`, `i` are integers. If `a[i]` is even, `l` contains the element at index 1 of list `g` if the second element of list `f` is true, otherwise `l` contains the value of `j`. In this case, `f[1]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not even and not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 but divisible by 13, `l` contains either the value at index 3 or 5 of list `g` or 1. In this scenario, the 7th element of list `f` and the 10th element of list `g` are updated based on specific conditions. The 6th element of list `f` changes based on the execution of the else part. Finally, `j` is updated to either 0 or 1 and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`, while `f[6]` is incremented by 1.***
