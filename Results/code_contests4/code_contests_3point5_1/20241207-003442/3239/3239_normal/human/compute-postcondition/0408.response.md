Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j` are in their initial state. For the if part, if the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 17, `f[7]` is incremented by 1. For the else part, if the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 19 but not by 23, `f[8]` is True, `g[8]` remains 0, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is appended to the list `l`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19 but divisible by 23, `f[9]` is False, `g[9]` is 1, `f[9]` is increased by 1, and `l` contains the value of `g[9]`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 19, 23, and 31, `f[10]` is True, `l` appends the value of `g[10]`. If `f[10]` is False, `l` is 1, and `f[10]` is incremented by 1.***
