Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state, the value of `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are adjusted based on the divisibility for the next iteration of the loop, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the appended values of `j`.
Output State: **n is a value greater than 0, arrays `a`, `f`, `l`, and `g` are adjusted based on the divisibility for the next iteration of the loop, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the appended values of `j`**
