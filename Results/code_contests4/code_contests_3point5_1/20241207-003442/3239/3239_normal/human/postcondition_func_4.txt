The function `func_5` reassigns the standard input and output streams to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt' respectively. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function setup seems to be intended for handling input and output redirection for test cases, possibly for competitive programming or automated testing purposes.
