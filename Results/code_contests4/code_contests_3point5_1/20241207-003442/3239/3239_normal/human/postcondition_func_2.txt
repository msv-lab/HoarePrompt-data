The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n`, then reads `n` strings as input. If the string is 'pwd', it prints the current directory path based on the elements in `cur`. If the string is not 'pwd', it manipulates the current directory path stored in `cur` based on the input string. The function does not return any value.
