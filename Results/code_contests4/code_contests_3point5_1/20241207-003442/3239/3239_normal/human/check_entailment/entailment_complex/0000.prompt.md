You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.

Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,…,a_n.

She wants to choose an integer m ≤ 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:

  * for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color; 
  * each element is colored and colored exactly one color; 
  * the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. 



Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.

Alice showed already that if all a_i ≤ 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m ≤ 11.

Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the amount of numbers in a sequence a.

The second line of the test case contains n composite integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print 2 lines. The first line should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 11) — the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from 1 to m. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m), where c_i is the color of the i-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Remember that each color from 1 to m should be used at least once. Any two elements of the same color should not be coprime (i.e. their GCD should be greater than 1).

4 7 8 10 7 3 10 7 7 8 3 1 1 5 5 9 2 2 3 3 4 11 6

Note

In the first test case, \gcd(6,10)=2, \gcd(6,15)=3 and \gcd(10,15)=5. Therefore, it's valid to color all elements the same color. Note that there are other colorings which satisfy Alice's requirement in this test case.

In the second test case there is only one element of each color, so the coloring definitely satisfies Alice's requirement.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from the user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The program prompts the user to input an integer value and returns this value as the output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** The input consists of a sequence of n composite numbers where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each composite number in the sequence is an integer between 4 and 1000 inclusive.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the sequence of n composite numbers where each composite number is an integer between 4 and 1000 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns an input sequence of n composite numbers. However, the code only calls the input() function without validating or processing the input as described in the annotations. It lacks the actual logic to ensure the input meets the criteria of being a sequence of n composite numbers where each number is between 4 and 1000 inclusive. Therefore, the function does not fully adhere to the postconditions provided.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer. Each element in the sequence a_i is a composite integer between 4 and 1000.**
def func_3():
def func():
    return map(int, input().split())
    cur = []
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input sequence split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n`, then reads `n` strings as input. If the string is 'pwd', it prints the current directory path based on the elements in `cur`. If the string is not 'pwd', it manipulates the current directory path stored in `cur` based on the input string. The function does not return any value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the input includes a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the amount of numbers in a sequence a. This is followed by a line containing n composite integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4() accepts no parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling the function func_3(). The function does not handle any edge cases or validations related to the input parameters as it does not accept any parameters itself.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- Each a_i (1 <= i <= n) is a composite integer such that 4 <= a_i <= 1000.
- The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.
def func_5():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reassigns the standard input and output streams to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt' respectively. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function setup seems to be intended for handling input and output redirection for test cases, possibly for competitive programming or automated testing purposes.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x and y are updated based on the swap and modulo operation, for the loop to terminate y will be 0
    return x
    #The program returns the final value of x after the swap and modulo operations, where y eventually becomes 0 to terminate the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, performs swap and modulo operations on `x` and `y` in a loop until `y` becomes 0, and returns the final value of `x` after the operations. The function effectively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input numbers `x` and `y`.

The lists `l`, `f`, and `g` will be updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution. The value of `j` will be updated according to the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` iterates through a loop, updating lists and variables based on specific divisibility conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It performs operations to print the values from `args` to a stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default, separated by `sep`. It writes a new line character if specified in `kwargs['end']`. Additionally, it flushes the output buffer if `kwargs['flush']` is True after writing the values. The function does not return any value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
