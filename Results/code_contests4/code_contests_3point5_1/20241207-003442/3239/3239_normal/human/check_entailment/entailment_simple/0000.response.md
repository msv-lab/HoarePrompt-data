Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It takes input for the number of test cases, the amount of numbers in the sequence, and the composite integers in the sequence. Then, for each test case, it colors the elements based on certain conditions related to the divisibility of the integers. The program ensures that the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, as required by the problem description. It outputs the number of colors used and the coloring that satisfies the conditions.

The program follows the problem description and correctly solves the task for each test case.
