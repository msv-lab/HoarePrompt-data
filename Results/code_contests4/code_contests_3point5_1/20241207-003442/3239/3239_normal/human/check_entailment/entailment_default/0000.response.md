Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to accurately implement the problem description. It correctly handles the input of composite numbers and assigns colors to elements based on divisibility properties. The output generated by the code also satisfies the conditions specified, ensuring that elements of the same color have a greatest common divisor greater than 1. Additionally, the code utilizes a loop to iterate through each test case and color the elements accordingly. Overall, the code seems to fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
