#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from the user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The program prompts the user to input an integer value and returns this value as the output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** The input consists of a sequence of n composite numbers where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each composite number in the sequence is an integer between 4 and 1000 inclusive.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the sequence of n composite numbers where each composite number is an integer between 4 and 1000 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns an input sequence of n composite numbers. However, the code only calls the input() function without validating or processing the input as described in the annotations. It lacks the actual logic to ensure the input meets the criteria of being a sequence of n composite numbers where each number is between 4 and 1000 inclusive. Therefore, the function does not fully adhere to the postconditions provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer. Each element in the sequence a_i is a composite integer between 4 and 1000.**
def func_3():
def func():
    return map(int, input().split())
    cur = []
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input sequence split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n`, then reads `n` strings as input. If the string is 'pwd', it prints the current directory path based on the elements in `cur`. If the string is not 'pwd', it manipulates the current directory path stored in `cur` based on the input string. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the input includes a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the amount of numbers in a sequence a. This is followed by a line containing n composite integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4() accepts no parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling the function func_3(). The function does not handle any edge cases or validations related to the input parameters as it does not accept any parameters itself.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- Each a_i (1 <= i <= n) is a composite integer such that 4 <= a_i <= 1000.
- The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.
def func_5():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reassigns the standard input and output streams to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt' respectively. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function setup seems to be intended for handling input and output redirection for test cases, possibly for competitive programming or automated testing purposes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x and y are updated based on the swap and modulo operation, for the loop to terminate y will be 0
    return x
    #The program returns the final value of x after the swap and modulo operations, where y eventually becomes 0 to terminate the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, performs swap and modulo operations on `x` and `y` in a loop until `y` becomes 0, and returns the final value of `x` after the operations. The function effectively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input numbers `x` and `y`.

The lists `l`, `f`, and `g` will be updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution. The value of `j` will be updated according to the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` iterates through a loop, updating lists and variables based on specific divisibility conditions.

The function does not take any parameters and returns a specific output based on the implemented logic within the function.

Additionally, it flushes the output buffer if `kwargs['flush']` is True after writing the values. The function does not return any value.
