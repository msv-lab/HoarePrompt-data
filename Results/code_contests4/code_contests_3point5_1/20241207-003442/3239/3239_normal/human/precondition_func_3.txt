** The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the input includes a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the amount of numbers in a sequence a. This is followed by a line containing n composite integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.
