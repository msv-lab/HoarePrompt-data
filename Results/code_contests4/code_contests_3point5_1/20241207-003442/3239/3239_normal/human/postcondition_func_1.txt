The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns an input sequence of n composite numbers. However, the code only calls the input() function without validating or processing the input as described in the annotations. It lacks the actual logic to ensure the input meets the criteria of being a sequence of n composite numbers where each number is between 4 and 1000 inclusive. Therefore, the function does not fully adhere to the postconditions provided.
