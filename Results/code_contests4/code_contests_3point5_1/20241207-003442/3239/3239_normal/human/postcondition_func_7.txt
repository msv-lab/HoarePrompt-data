Functionality: The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It performs operations to print the values from `args` to a stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default, separated by `sep`. It writes a new line character if specified in `kwargs['end']`. Additionally, it flushes the output buffer if `kwargs['flush']` is True after writing the values. The function does not return any value.
