Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program seems to be overly complicated and does not follow the requirements specified in the problem description. The program uses a complex mapping of prime numbers to colors which is not necessary to solve the problem. Additionally, the program does not handle all the cases where the greatest common divisor of elements that are colored the same color should be greater than 1. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description for every potential case.
