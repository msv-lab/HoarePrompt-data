Correctness: **True**

The program iterates 10 times, taking an integer input each time, and calculates the sum of these inputs. Finally, it prints the total sum. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which states that the program should output the total score of the 10 input integers. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
