Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `k + int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `k` was 0, so after execution, `k` will be the input integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: Each si (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) is an integer representing the score of a problem, `k` is the input integer value.
Output State: **Each si (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) is an integer representing the score of a problem, `k` is the input integer value**
