Example Answer:
The value of `k` is updated by adding the integer value of the user input. The previous value of `k` is unknown, so the new value depends on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: No adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is updated by adding the integer value of the user input.
Output State: **No adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is updated by adding the integer value of the user input**
