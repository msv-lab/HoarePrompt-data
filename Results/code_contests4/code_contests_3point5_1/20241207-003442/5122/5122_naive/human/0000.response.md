Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always provide the correct output as per the problem description. For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output 4 instead of the expected output of 6. This is because the program subtracts the minimum odd number from the total sum to make it even, which may not always result in the maximum even sum. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
