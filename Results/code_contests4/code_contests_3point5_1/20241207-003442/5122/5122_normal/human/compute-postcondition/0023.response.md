Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It calculates the sum of the integers in the list and finds the minimum value. If the sum of the integers is odd, it subtracts the minimum value from the sum and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters. However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the input list is empty or where the sum is even, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
