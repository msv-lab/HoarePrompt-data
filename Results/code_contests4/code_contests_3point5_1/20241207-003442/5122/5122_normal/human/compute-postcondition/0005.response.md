Example Answer:
`e` is added to `res`, where `e` is the first element in the map object `vs`. The value of `res` is incremented. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer determined by user input, `vs` is a map object with at least one element, `minO` is -1, `res` is the sum of the first element in `vs`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by user input, `vs` is a map object with at least one element, `minO` is -1, `res` is the sum of the first element in `vs`**
