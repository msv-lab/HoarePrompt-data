Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now determined by the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer determined by user input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by user input**
