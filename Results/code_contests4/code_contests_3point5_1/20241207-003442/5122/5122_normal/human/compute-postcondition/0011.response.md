Example Answer:
`minO` is assigned the value of `e`, which means `minO` now holds the value of the current `e`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `vs` is a map object with at least one element, `minO` is the current value of `e`, `res` is the sum of the first element in `vs` plus `e`, for the loop to execute one more time, `e` needs to iterate to the next element in `vs`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `vs` is a map object with at least one element, `minO` is the current value of `e`, `res` is the sum of the first element in `vs` plus `e`, for the loop to execute one more time, `e` needs to iterate to the next element in `vs`**
