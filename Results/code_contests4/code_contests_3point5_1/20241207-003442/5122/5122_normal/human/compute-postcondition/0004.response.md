According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `vs` map object. If the map object has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `minO` is -1 and `res` is 0. So, for the loop to execute, the map object `vs` must have at least one element, and `e` is the first element in the map object.
State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by user input, `vs` is a map object with at least one element, `minO` is -1, `res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `e` is the first element in the map object**
