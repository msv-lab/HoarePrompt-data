Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer determined by user input, `vs` is a map object with at least one element, `minO` is either -1 or greater than `e`, `res` is the sum of the first element in `vs`. If `minO` is -1 or greater than `e`, `minO` is updated to `e` and `res` is updated to the sum of the first element in `vs`.***
