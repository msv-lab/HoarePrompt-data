Example Answer:
The variable `res` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer determined by user input, `vs` is a map object containing integers converted from user input split by spaces, `minO` is -1, `res` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by user input, `vs` is a map object containing integers converted from user input split by spaces, `minO` is -1, `res` is 0**
