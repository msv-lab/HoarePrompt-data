Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `vs` is a map object with at least one element, `minO` is either -1 or greater than or equal to `e`, `res` is the updated sum of the first element in `vs` plus the next element after `e` in `vs`. If `minO` is -1 or greater than `e`, the program updates `res` with the sum of the first element in `vs` and the next element after `e` in `vs`.***
