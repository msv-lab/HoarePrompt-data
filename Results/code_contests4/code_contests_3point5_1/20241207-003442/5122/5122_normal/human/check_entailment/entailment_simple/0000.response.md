Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained by Wet Shark using the given integers. It iterates through the integers, calculates the sum, and keeps track of the minimum odd integer encountered. If the sum is odd, it subtracts the minimum odd integer to make it even. Finally, it prints the resulting sum, which is the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained.

The program follows the problem description by ensuring that the maximum even sum is calculated by using the given integers appropriately. It covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
