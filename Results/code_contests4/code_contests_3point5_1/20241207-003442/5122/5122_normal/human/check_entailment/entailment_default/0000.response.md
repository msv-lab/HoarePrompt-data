Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. It fails to handle the case where the input list is empty, which should result in an output of 0. Additionally, it does not consider the situation where the sum of the integers is already even, in which case no subtraction should occur. Therefore, the code needs to be updated to handle these edge cases in order to fully meet the problem requirements.
