Correctness: False

The given program does not always provide the correct output according to the problem description. It fails to consider all possible combinations of integers to achieve the maximum even sum. For example, in the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The correct output should be 6 (by taking all three integers), but the program will output 5 (by taking 2 and 3). 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
