Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description by taking input for the number of students using two-block and three-block pieces, calculating the minimum possible height of the tallest tower, and outputting the result. The logic used in the program is accurate and follows the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the program uses the correct mathematical formula to determine the minimum height necessary for the tallest tower. All provided examples also produce the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
