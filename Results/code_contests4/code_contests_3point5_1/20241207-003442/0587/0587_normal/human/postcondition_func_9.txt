The function func_10 accepts a non-negative integer x and performs bitwise AND operations between x and not x, and then between the result and x - 1, returning the final result. However, the annotation mentions a bitwise AND operation between x and not x, which always results in 0 due to the properties of bitwise NOT. Therefore, the function always returns False regardless of the input x.
