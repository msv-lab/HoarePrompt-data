The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters but operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`. It iterates through a range of integers and calls `func_20(i)` if there exists an integer `i` satisfying specific conditions based on `n` and `m`. However, there is no explicit return value from the function.
