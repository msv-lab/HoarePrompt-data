The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters x, y, and a positive integer parameter p. It calculates the result `res` based on the iterative calculations within the loop. It updates the value of `x` and `res` according to the loop conditions, and finally returns the calculated result. The loop continues until `y` becomes 0. The function does not handle cases where `p` is 0, and it assumes `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
