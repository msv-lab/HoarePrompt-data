The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters. It sets the standard input and output to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. The function assumes the existence of non-negative integers `n` and `m` such that `n + m > 0`, but it does not specify any further logic or operations to be performed. The actual functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in the code provided.
