The function `func_16` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x + y > 0`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`, where `x` becomes the greatest common divisor and `y` becomes 0 after the loop execution. Therefore, the function effectively computes the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integers.
