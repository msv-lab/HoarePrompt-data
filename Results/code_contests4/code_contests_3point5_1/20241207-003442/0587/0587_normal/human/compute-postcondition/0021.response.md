Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty, and `file.write(str(x))` has been executed for each element in `args`. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs`, it has been removed and its corresponding value has been evaluated as `True`.***
