Functionality: ** The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args` and writes them to the specified `file` with the provided `sep` between elements. It then writes the `end` character at the end of the output. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the internal buffer of the `file`. This function does not have a return value. **
