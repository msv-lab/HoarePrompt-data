Example Answer: 
The `pop` method removes and returns the value of the specified key from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the key 'end' exists in `kwargs`, it will be removed and its value will be written to the file. If 'end' does not exist in `kwargs`, '\n' will be written to the file. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty, and `file.write(str(x))` has been executed for each element in `args`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty, and `file.write(str(x))` has been executed for each element in `args`**
