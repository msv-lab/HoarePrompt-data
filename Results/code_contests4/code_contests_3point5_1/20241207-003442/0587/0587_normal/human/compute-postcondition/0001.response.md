Example Answer: 
The code assigns the values of 'sep' and 'file' by popping the 'sep' and 'file' key-value pairs from the 'kwargs' dictionary. If 'sep' or 'file' keys are not present in 'kwargs', default values ' ' and 'sys.stdout' are used respectively. Since the initial state does not provide information about the contents of 'kwargs', we cannot determine the specific values of 'sep' and 'file'. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.
Output State: **n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0**
