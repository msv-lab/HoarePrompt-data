According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition is that `args` should still not be empty.
State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty for the loop to execute one more time**
