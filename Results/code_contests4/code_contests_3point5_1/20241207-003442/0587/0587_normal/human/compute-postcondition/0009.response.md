According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If there are still elements in `args`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args` for `x` to take as the next value.

State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty for the loop to execute one more time**
