According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If args is not empty, the loop can execute. Given that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, and `at_start` is `True`, we need to adjust the state such that `args` is not empty for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `at_start` is `True`, for the loop to execute `args` is not empty**
