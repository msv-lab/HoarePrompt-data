Example Answer: 
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `at_start`, `args`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty for the loop to execute one more time**
