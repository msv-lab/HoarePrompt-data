Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. Since `at_start` is a boolean variable, it can only have values `True` or `False`. In this case, it is assigned `True`. The other variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `at_start` is `True`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `at_start` is `True`**
