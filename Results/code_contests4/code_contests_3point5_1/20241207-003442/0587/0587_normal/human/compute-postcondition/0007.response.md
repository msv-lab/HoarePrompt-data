Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file using the `file.write` method. The previous values of the variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty. If `at_start` is not `True`, then `sep` is written to the file and the value of `x` is written.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty. If `at_start` is not `True`, then `sep` is written to the file and the value of `x` is written.**
