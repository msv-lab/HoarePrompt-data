Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of `x` to a file. The values of `n`, `m`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty for the loop to execute one more time.**
