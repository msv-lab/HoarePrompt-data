Example Answer:
The `sep` variable is written to the file using the `write` function. The value of `sep` is not provided, so the output state will be updated with the value of `sep` being written to the file.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is not empty, the loop has executed at least once, `sep` is written to the file**
