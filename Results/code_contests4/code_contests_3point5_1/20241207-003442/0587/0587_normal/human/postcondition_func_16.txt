The function `func_17` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as a parameter. It then goes through a series of conditions to determine whether `n` is a prime number. If `n` satisfies the conditions for being a prime number, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3, divisible by 2 or 3, and also performs a more elaborate check for prime numbers using a loop.
