Correctness: **True**

The annotated program contains functions that are designed to handle the input, perform necessary calculations, and output the result as required by the problem description. Each function is documented with its purpose and the expected state of the program before and after its execution.

The main functions, func_19 and func_20, are responsible for calculating the minimum possible height of the tallest tower based on the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces. The logic within these functions correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, ensuring that no two towers have the same number of blocks and finding the minimum height necessary for the tallest tower.

Overall, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description and the functions work together cohesively to produce the desired output.
