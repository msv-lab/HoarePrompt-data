Based on the problem description and the provided functions, let's assess the correctness of the program:

1. The program takes input of the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, and then calculates the minimum height necessary for the tallest tower.

2. The program seems to correctly calculate the tallest tower height by considering the combinations of two-block and three-block towers to ensure that no two students have the same number of blocks in their towers.

3. The functions provided do not have any explicit logic that would lead to incorrect calculations based on the problem description.

4. The output hints do not misrepresent any edge cases or scenarios that are not valid according to the problem description.

Therefore, based on the evaluation, the code appears to follow the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
