The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where x + y > 0. If x is divisible by y without any remainder, it returns the result of x divided by y. If x is not divisible by y, it returns the result of x divided by y plus 1. The function handles cases where x is divisible by y and where it is not, providing the corresponding division results.
