Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of the rectangular parallelepiped based on the areas of its three faces. It calculates the lengths of the edges incorrectly based on the given areas, which results in an incorrect output. 

For example, when the input is "4 6 6", the expected output should be 28, but the program does not produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this potential case.
