Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value of the square root of the division of `a` by `b` multiplied by `c`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are float values. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` as float values, `x` is the calculated result.
