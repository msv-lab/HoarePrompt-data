Example Answer:
The value of `z` is calculated as the square root of `(c / a * b)`. After that, the `print` function calculates the result by multiplying 4 with the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z`, but `y` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are float values, `x` remains the same, `z` is the square root of `(c / a * b)`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are float values, `x` remains the same, `z` is the square root of `(c / a * b)`**
