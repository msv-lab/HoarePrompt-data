Example Answer:
`y` is calculated as the square root of `(b / c * a)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are float values, and `x` is not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are float values, `x` remains the same.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are float values, `x` remains the same**
