Example Answer:
The value of `z` is calculated as the square root of `(c / a * b)`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are float values, the result of the expression `(c / a * b)` will also be a float value. Therefore, the square root of this float value will be assigned to `z`. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are float values, `x` remains the same; `z` is the square root of `(c / a * b)`**
