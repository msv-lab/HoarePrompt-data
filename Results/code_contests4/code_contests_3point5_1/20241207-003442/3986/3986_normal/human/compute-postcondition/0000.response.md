Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the float values obtained by splitting the input. The areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped are represented by these variables. The values are positive integers not exceeding 10^4. Therefore, the Output State is: The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` as float values.
Output State: **The areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are represented by `a`, `b`, and `c` as float values**
