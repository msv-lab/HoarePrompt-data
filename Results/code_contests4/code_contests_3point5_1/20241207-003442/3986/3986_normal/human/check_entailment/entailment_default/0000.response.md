Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes three space-separated integers as input representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. It then calculates the square roots of specific area ratios and prints the result of a mathematical operation involving these square roots. The code correctly calculates the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped as per the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness. The code handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
