Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program calculates the square roots of specific area ratios and prints the result of a mathematical operation involving these square roots. However, the program does not actually calculate the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped, which is the required task according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
