Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped based on the input areas of the three faces. The formula used in the program is not consistent with the problem description. The program calculates the surface areas of the parallelepiped's faces and then finds the sum of the lengths of the edges, which is not the correct approach.

To correct the program, a new approach needs to be implemented to calculate the sum of all edges based on the given areas of the three faces.
