Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes in the areas of the three faces of the parallelepiped, calculates the lengths of the edges using the given formulas, and then calculates the sum of all the edges. The logic in the code seems correct as it follows the formula to calculate the edge lengths based on the areas of the faces. For all the given examples in the problem description, the program produces the correct output. Additionally, since the input values are guaranteed to be positive integers, the calculations are valid and the output is the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.
