Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of balls `n` and the values on the balls `a`.
2. It then calls `func_2` with the frequency of the most common element in the list `a`.
3. The `func_2` function prints the values to the output as required.
4. The program correctly determines the minimum number of colors Nezzar can use based on the problem description.
5. The code annotations are consistent with the code logic and there are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that are not handled by the code.
