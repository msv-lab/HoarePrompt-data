Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue is that `func_2` is missing the necessary arguments to correctly calculate and output the minimum number of colors Nezzar can use. The function definition lacks `*args` and `**kwargs` to capture the arguments and keyword arguments passed to it. Additionally, the logic within `func_2` is incomplete and does not calculate the minimum number of colors as required by the problem description.

Furthermore, the program does not handle the case where Nezzar has to discard all balls of the same number, which would require a new color. This scenario is not considered in the program.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
