Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. There are no other affected variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the popped value or ' ', `file` is either the popped value or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is either the popped value or ' ', `file` is either the popped value or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True**
