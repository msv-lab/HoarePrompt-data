According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `sep` is either the popped value or ' ', `file` is either the popped value or `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is True. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `args` must have at least 1 element, `sep` needs to be either the popped value or ' ', `file` needs to be either the popped value or `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` must be True.
State: **`sep` is either the popped value or ' ', `file` is either the popped value or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element**
