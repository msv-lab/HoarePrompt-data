Functionality: **The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes the elements in args by writing them to a file specified in kwargs or sys.stdout with a separator specified in kwargs. It then writes the value specified by the 'end' key in kwargs to the file with a newline character. If the 'flush' key in kwargs is True, the file is flushed.**
