Example Answer: 
The `pop` method removes and returns an item from a dictionary based on the specified key. If the key is found, the value is assigned to the respective variable (`sep` or `file`), otherwise, the default values `' '` and `sys.stdout` are assigned. Since there are no previous values given for `kwargs`, we can't determine the exact values of `sep` and `file`. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the initial state, `sep` is either the popped value or ' ', `file` is either the popped value or `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **No change in the initial state, `sep` is either the popped value or ' ', `file` is either the popped value or `sys.stdout`**
