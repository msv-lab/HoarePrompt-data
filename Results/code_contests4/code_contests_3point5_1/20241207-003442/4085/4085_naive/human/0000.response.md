Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes an input of N integers and then finds the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after replacing one of them with an integer of your choice between 1 and 10^9. The program uses the gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor and then iterates through the sorted array of integers to find the maximum possible gcd. The logic seems sound and is in line with the problem description. Additionally, the program handles input/output using FastIO for efficiency. Since the program follows the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work as expected, the correctness is deemed true.
