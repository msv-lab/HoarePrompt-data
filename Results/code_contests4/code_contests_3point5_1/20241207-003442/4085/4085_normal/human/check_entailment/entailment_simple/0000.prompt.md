You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N integers, A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, written on the blackboard.

You will choose one of them and replace it with an integer of your choice between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), possibly the same as the integer originally written.

Find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after your move.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Output

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output

Print the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after your move.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, and A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N.**
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(readlist())
    gcd_arr = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        gcd_arr[i + 1] = gcd(gcd_arr[i], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N, a is a sorted list of integers from readlist(), gcd_arr is a list where gcd_arr[i + 1] is the greatest common divisor of gcd_arr[i] and a[i] for 0 <= i < N
    gcd_arr_rev = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        gcd_arr_rev[i] = gcd(gcd_arr_rev[i + 1], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N, a is a sorted list of integers from readlist(), gcd_arr is a list where gcd_arr[i + 1] is the greatest common divisor of gcd_arr[i] and a[i] for 0 <= i < N, gcd_arr_rev is a list of updated greatest common divisors in reverse order
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res = max(res, gcd(gcd_arr[i], gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N, a is a sorted list of integers from readlist(), gcd_arr is a list where gcd_arr[i + 1] is the greatest common divisor of gcd_arr[i] and a[i] for 0 <= i < N, gcd_arr_rev is a list of updated greatest common divisors in reverse order, res is the maximum value between all combinations of gcd_arr and gcd_arr_rev
    func_2(res)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is the popped value, `file` is the popped value with all elements from `args` written to it separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is an empty list
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep`, `file`, `args` are popped values and `at_start` is False. If 'flush' is True in kwargs, then the file is flushed after writing all elements from `args` separated by `sep` and 'end' value to it. Otherwise, no operation is performed.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
