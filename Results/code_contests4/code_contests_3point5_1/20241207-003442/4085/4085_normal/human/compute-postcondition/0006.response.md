Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string using `str(x)` and then written to the `file`. If `not at_start`, then the `sep` value is written to the `file`. Since `at_start` is False, the `sep` value is written to the `file`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is the popped value, `file` is the popped value, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least one element, and the `sep` value is written to the `file`.
Output State: **`sep` is the popped value, `file` is the popped value, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one element, and the `sep` value is written to the `file`**
