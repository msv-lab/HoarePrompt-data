According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `args`. If there are more elements left in `args`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` and `file` were popped, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least one element. So for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have elements left.
State: **`sep` is the popped value, `file` is the popped value, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one element, and the `sep` value is written to the `file` for the loop to execute one more time `args` must have more elements left**
