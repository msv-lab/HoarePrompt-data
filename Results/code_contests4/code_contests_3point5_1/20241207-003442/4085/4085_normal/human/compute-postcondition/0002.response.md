According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args`. If `args` has at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. The values should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`sep` is the popped value, `file` is the popped value, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least one element**
