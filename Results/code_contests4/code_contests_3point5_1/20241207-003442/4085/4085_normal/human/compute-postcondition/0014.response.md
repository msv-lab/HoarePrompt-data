Example Answer:
The value of `sep` is written to the `file`. The `file` now contains the `sep` value written to it. The value of `at_start` remains False and there are still more elements left in `args`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is written to `file`, `at_start` is False, `args` has more elements left.
Output State: **`sep` is written to `file`, `at_start` is False, `args` has more elements left**
