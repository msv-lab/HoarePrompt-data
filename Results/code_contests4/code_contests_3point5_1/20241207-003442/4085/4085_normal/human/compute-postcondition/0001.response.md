Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either `b' '` or the popped value, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or the popped value, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is either `b' '` or the popped value, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or the popped value, `at_start` is True**
