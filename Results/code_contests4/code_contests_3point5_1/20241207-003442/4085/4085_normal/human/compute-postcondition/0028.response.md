Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, sorts `a`, calculates the greatest common divisors of elements in `a` in both forward and reverse directions, then finds the maximum value among combinations of these greatest common divisors. It then calls `func_2` with the maximum value as an argument. The function does not accept any parameters and operates within predefined constraints for `n` and `a`.**
