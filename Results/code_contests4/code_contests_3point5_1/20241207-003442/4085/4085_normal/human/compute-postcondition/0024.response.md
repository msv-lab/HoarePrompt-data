Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It initializes `sep` and `file` values by popping from `kwargs`. It then iterates through the elements in `args`, writing them to the `file` separated by `sep`. The function sets `at_start` to False after the first element is written. Finally, it appends the value of 'end' to the file and flushes the file if 'flush' is True in `kwargs`. This function performs operations on the file based on the provided `kwargs` but does not have a return value. **
