Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned the values popped from the `kwargs` dictionary with default values of `b' '` and `sys.stdout` respectively. If `sep` and `file` were not present in `kwargs`, they would retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either `b' '` or the popped value, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or the popped value.
Output State: **`sep` is either `b' '` or the popped value, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or the popped value**
