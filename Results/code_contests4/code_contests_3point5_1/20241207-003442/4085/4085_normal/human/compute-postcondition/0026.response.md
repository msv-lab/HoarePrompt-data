Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, `A_i` is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N, `a` is a sorted list of integers from readlist(), `gcd_arr` is a list where `gcd_arr[i + 1]` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_arr[i]` and `a[i]` for 0 <= i < N, `gcd_arr_rev` is a list of updated greatest common divisors in reverse order, `res` is the maximum value between all combinations of `gcd_arr` and `gcd_arr_rev**`.
