The value of `sep` is written to the `file`. Since the loop executes one more time, there must be more elements left in `args`. The value of `at_start` remains False. 
Output State: **`sep` is the popped value, `file` is the popped value with `sep` written to it, `at_start` is False, `args` has more elements left**
