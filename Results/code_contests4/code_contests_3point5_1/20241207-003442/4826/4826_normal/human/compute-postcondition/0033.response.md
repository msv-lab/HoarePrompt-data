Output State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element. The loop will iterate through all elements of the coordinates list, updating `dist` to the smallest difference between consecutive elements, and `count` to the number of occurrences of that smallest difference. `index`, `x`, and `temp_dist` will have final values based on the last iteration of the loop.**
