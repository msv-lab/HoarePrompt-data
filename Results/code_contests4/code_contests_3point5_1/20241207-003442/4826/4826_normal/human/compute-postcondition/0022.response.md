Postcondition: ***`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, `count` is 2, `x` is the first element in the coordinates list, and `temp_dist` is the result of subtracting `x` from the element at `index + 1` in the coordinates list.***
