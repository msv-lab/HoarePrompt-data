Example Answer:
`dist` is updated to the smallest difference between consecutive elements in the `coordinates` list. `count` is updated to the number of occurrences of that smallest difference. `index`, `x`, and `temp_dist` will have final values based on the last iteration of the loop. The `print` statement outputs the values of `dist` and `count` concatenated as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `dist` is the smallest difference between consecutive elements, `count` is the number of occurrences of that smallest difference, `index`, `x`, and `temp_dist` have final values based on the last iteration of the loop, and the `print` statement outputs the values of `dist` and `count`.
Output State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `dist` is the smallest difference between consecutive elements, `count` is the number of occurrences of that smallest difference, `index`, `x`, and `temp_dist` have final values based on the last iteration of the loop, and the `print` statement outputs the values of `dist` and `count`**
