Postcondition: ***`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `dist` is equal to `temp_dist`, `count` is 1, x is the first element in the coordinates list, and `temp_dist` is the result of subtracting x from the element at index + 1 in the coordinates list. If `temp_dist` < `dist`, then the function updates `dist` to `temp_dist`. Otherwise, `dist` remains as 2 * 10, `temp_dist` is greater than or equal to `dist`, and `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`.***
