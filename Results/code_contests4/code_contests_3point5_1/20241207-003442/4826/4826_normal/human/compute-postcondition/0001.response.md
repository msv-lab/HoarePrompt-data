Example Answer:
`coordinates` is assigned the result of mapping integer conversion to each element of the input split by spaces. The value of `cities` is not affected, but `coordinates` now holds the converted integer values from the input. 
Output State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers based on the input split by spaces**
