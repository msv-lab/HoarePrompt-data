According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the coordinates list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, the count is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and index is 0, x is the first element in the coordinates list.
State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `dist` is assigned the value 2 * 10, `count` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time index is 0 and x is the first element in the coordinates list**
