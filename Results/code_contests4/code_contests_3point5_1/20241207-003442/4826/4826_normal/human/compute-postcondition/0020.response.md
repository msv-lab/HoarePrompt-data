Example Answer:
The value of `count` is reassigned to 1. Since there are no calculations or changes to other variables, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `index` must be less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, `dist` is equal to `temp_dist`, `count` is 1, `x` is the first element in the coordinates list, `temp_dist` is the result of subtracting `x` from the element at `index + 1` in the coordinates list.**
