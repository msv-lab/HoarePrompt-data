Output State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `dist` is now equal to `temp_dist`, `count` is 1, x is the first element in the coordinates list, and `temp_dist` is the result of subtracting x from the element at index + 1 in the coordinates list. The temp_dist is less than dist.**
