Output State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, if the loop is to execute again `index` must be less than `len(coordinates) - 1`, `dist` is equal to `temp_dist`, `count` is 2, `x` is the first element in the coordinates list, and `temp_dist` is the result of subtracting `x` from the element at `index + 1` in the coordinates list.**
