Example Answer:
The list `coordinates` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list `coordinates` are rearranged accordingly. The variable `cities` is not affected by this sorting operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`cities` is an integer value based on user input, `coordinates` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
