Postcondition: ***`cities`, `coordinates`, `index`, `temp_dist`, `count`, `x` are integers. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is updated to be equal to `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, then `count` remains either 1 or 2. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and relationships as described in the precondition.***
