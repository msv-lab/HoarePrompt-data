Postcondition: ***`cities`, `coordinates`, `index`, `temp_dist`, `count`, `x` are integers. If `index` is less than the length of `coordinates` - 1, the function checks if `temp_dist` is less than `dist`. If true, `dist` is updated to `temp_dist` and `count` is set to 1. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, `count` remains unchanged at either 1 or 2. All other variables maintain their initial values and relationships described in the precondition.***
