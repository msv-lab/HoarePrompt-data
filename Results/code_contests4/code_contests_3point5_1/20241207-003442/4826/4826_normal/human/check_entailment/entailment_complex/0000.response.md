Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, sorts the coordinates, calculates the smallest difference between consecutive elements, and counts the occurrences of that smallest difference. Finally, it prints the smallest difference and the count of occurrences as required by the problem description. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
