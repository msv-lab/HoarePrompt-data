Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `cities` from the standard input, followed by a list of integer coordinates. 
- It then sorts the coordinates in ascending order.
- It calculates the smallest difference between consecutive elements by iterating through the sorted coordinates list and keeping track of the minimum difference (`dist`).
- It counts the occurrences of that smallest difference by checking if the current difference is smaller than the minimum difference found so far (`dist`), and updates the count accordingly.
- Finally, it prints the smallest difference and the count of occurrences.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output based on the given examples.
