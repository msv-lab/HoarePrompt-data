Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal possible distance between two pairs of cities and the quantity of pairs with this distance. It iterates through the sorted list of coordinates, calculating the distance between consecutive elements and updating the minimum distance and count accordingly. It handles cases where there are multiple pairs with the same minimal distance by updating the count appropriately. The output format also matches the expected format in the problem description.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly identifies the minimum possible distance between two cities and the quantity of pairs with this distance.
