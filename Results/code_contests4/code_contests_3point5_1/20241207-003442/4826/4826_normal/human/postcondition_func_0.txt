The function `func` reads an integer `cities` from the standard input, followed by a list of integer coordinates. It then sorts the coordinates, calculates the smallest difference between consecutive elements, and counts the occurrences of that smallest difference. Finally, it prints the smallest difference and the count of occurrences. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the provided preconditions.
