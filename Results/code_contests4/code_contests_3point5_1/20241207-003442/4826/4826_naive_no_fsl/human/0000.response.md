Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in the `coordinates` list after sorting them.
2. It then iterates through the sorted list to find the minimum distance between adjacent cities.
3. The program correctly keeps track of the minimum distance and the count of pairs with that distance.
4. The output is also correctly formatted and printed as required.
5. The program handles the case where there are multiple pairs of cities with minimal possible distance by incrementing the count accordingly.
6. For all possible cases provided in the problem description, the program works as expected and provides the correct output.
