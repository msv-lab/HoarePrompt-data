Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads an integer n and a list of n coordinates. It then sorts the list of coordinates and iterates through them to find the minimum distance between two cities. The program correctly calculates the minimal possible distance between two pairs of cities and the quantity of pairs which have this distance. It handles multiple pairs with the same minimum distance by keeping track of the count. The implementation is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
