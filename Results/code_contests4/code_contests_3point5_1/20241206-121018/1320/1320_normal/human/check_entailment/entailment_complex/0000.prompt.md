You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.

Example

Input

Output

Note

In the first test case of the example beautiful years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The annotations state this functionality accurately, and there are no missing edge cases or functionalities.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s` and prints the value of `s` to the standard output followed by a new line character. There are no specific constraints mentioned for the parameter `s`, and the function does not have any specific return value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer after reading input from the user. The integer read is within the range of 1 to 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from the user and returns it as an integer. The input integer is expected to be within the range of 1 to 10^9. The function does not explicitly specify any constraints or error handling for cases where the input integer is outside the defined range or if the input is not a valid integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the int function to each element of the input obtained from the readln() function after splitting it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input, splits it, and converts each element to an integer using the `int` function. It returns a map object containing these integer elements. The annotation suggests that the function reads input using `readln()`, but the actual code does not include a definition for `readln()`, so there is a missing functionality in the code.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the value read from the input, which is a positive integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from the input, where 1 <= n <= 10^9, and then returns this value.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads an input string from the console and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the program is in debug mode, then the function executes in debug mode. Otherwise, there is no specific action taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 does not accept any parameters. If the debug mode is enabled, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it does nothing.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns the result of the expression max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list X, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, calculates the result of the expression max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2), and returns this result. If the list X is empty, the function will return 0.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
