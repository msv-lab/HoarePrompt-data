Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program should count the number of beautiful numbers from 1 to n inclusive, where a beautiful number is defined as a positive integer consisting of only one digit repeated one or more times. 

However, the code does not implement the logic to count the beautiful numbers correctly. The code only reads input and performs some basic operations with integers but does not include the necessary logic to determine the count of beautiful numbers. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
