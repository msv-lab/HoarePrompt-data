First, let's analyze the code and see if it follows the problem description for every potential case.

The code provided includes multiple functions that handle input/output operations and some calculations. The main function `func_8` accepts a list of integers X, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, calculates the result of the expression `max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)`, and returns this result.

Now, let's see if the output hints agree with the code and if they provide any additional insights.

The output hints for function 8 do not directly align with the problem description given. The code seems to be related to finding the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum values in a list, which is not directly related to the problem statement about beautiful numbers.

Based on the analysis, it is evident that the code provided does not align with the problem description for every potential case. The code is not checking for beautiful numbers as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the Correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly identify the number of beautiful years between 1 and n inclusive as required by the problem description.
