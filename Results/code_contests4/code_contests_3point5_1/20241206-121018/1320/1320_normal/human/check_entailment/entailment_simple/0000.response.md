Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of functions that read input, process it, and output the result. The program correctly follows the problem description by reading the number of test cases, iterating through each test case, calculating the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, and then printing the result. The program handles the constraints specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for each test case.
