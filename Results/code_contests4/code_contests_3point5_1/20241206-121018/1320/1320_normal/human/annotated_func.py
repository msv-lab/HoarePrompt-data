#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The annotations state this functionality accurately, and there are no missing edge cases or functionalities.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s` and prints the value of `s` to the standard output followed by a new line character. There are no specific constraints mentioned for the parameter `s`, and the function does not have any specific return value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer after reading input from the user. The integer read is within the range of 1 to 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from the user and returns it as an integer. The input integer is expected to be within the range of 1 to 10^9. The function does not explicitly specify any constraints or error handling for cases where the input integer is outside the defined range or if the input is not a valid integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the int function to each element of the input obtained from the readln() function after splitting it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input, splits it, and converts each element to an integer using the `int` function. It returns a map object containing these integer elements. The annotation suggests that the function reads input using `readln()`, but the actual code does not include a definition for `readln()`, so there is a missing functionality in the code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the value read from the input, which is a positive integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from the input, where 1 <= n <= 10^9, and then returns this value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from the console
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads an input string from the console and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If the program is in debug mode, then the function executes in debug mode. Otherwise, there is no specific action taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 does not accept any parameters. If the debug mode is enabled, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it does nothing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns the result of the expression max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list X, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, calculates the result of the expression max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2), and returns this result. If the list X is empty, the function will return 0.
