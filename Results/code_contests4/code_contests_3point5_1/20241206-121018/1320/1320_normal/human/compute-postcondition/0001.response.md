Example Answer:
`maxX` is assigned the maximum value of the list `X`. The value of `minX` is the minimum value of the list `X`, but the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `minX` is the minimum value of the list `X`, `maxX` is the maximum value of the list `X`.
Output State: **`minX` is the minimum value of the list `X`, `maxX` is the maximum value of the list `X`**
