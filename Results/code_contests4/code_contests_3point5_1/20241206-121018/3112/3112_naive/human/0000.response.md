Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the choices c_1 c_2 ... c_n to maximize the average number of wins in the "Rock paper scissors" game. It converts the input string into a list of integers representing the choices of the bot, counts the occurrences of each choice, determines the choice that occurs most frequently, and prints the corresponding choice to maximize the average number of wins. The program iterates over each test case and produces the correct output based on the described problem. Since the program handles all possible test cases and provides the expected outputs, it can be considered correct.
