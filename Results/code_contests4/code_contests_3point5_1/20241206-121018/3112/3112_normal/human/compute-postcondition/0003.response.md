Example Answer:
The variable `t` is assigned the integer value of the input. Since `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `t` will be the integer value of the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an integer value.
Output State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an integer value**
