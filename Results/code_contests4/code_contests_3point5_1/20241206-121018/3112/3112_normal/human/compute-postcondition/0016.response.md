Output State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `S` is a list containing the mapped values based on the input with at least 1 element, `count` is a list where each index represents the count of 'R', 'P', 'S' respectively in the list `S`, `maxi` is assigned the value from the `range(3)` based on the maximum count of 'R', 'P', 'S' in the list `S` using the `count` list, `maxi` is decremented by 2. A string is printed based on the value of `maxi` multiplied by the length of `S`.**
