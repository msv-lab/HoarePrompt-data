Example Answer: 
The value of `count[s]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count[s]` is unknown, so after execution, `count[s]` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is updated based on the value of `s`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in `S`.
Output State: **`count` is updated based on the value of `s`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in `S`**
