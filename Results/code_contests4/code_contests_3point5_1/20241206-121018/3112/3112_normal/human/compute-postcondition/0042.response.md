Example Answer:
The character at index 1 in 'RPS' is printed based on the value of `maxi`, which can be -2, -1, or 0. Then, the result is multiplied by the length of `S`. The list `S` is created based on the input string and the `mapper` dictionary. Finally, the list `count` contains the final count of occurrences of each character in `S`. 
Output State: **Character at index 1 in 'RPS' is printed and multiplied by the length of `S`, `S` is a new list, `count` contains the final count of occurrences of each character in `S`**
