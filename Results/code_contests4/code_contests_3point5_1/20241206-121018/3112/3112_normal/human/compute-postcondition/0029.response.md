Example Answer: 
The character at the index `maxi` in the string 'RPS' is printed and then multiplied by the length of string `S`. Since the value of `maxi` is decremented by 2 initially, the character at index 1 ('P') will be printed and multiplied by the length of `S`. The value of `maxi` before the decrement is unknown, and the value of `S` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxi` is decremented by 2, and the character at index 1 in 'RPS' is printed and multiplied by the length of `S`.
Output State: **`maxi` is decremented by 2, and the character at index 1 in 'RPS' is printed and multiplied by the length of `S`**
