Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `S` is a list containing the mapped values based on the input with at least 1 element, `count` is a list where each index represents the final count of 'R', 'P', 'S' respectively in the updated list `S`, `maxi` is decremented by 2 based on the final `count` list, and a string is printed based on the value of `maxi` multiplied by the length of the final `S`.**
