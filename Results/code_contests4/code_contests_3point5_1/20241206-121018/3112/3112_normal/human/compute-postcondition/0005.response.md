Example Answer:
The list comprehension `S = [mapper[c] for c in input()]` creates a new list `S` by mapping each character `c` from the input to its corresponding value in the `mapper` dictionary. Since `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, the input will be taken as a string. As a result, if the input string contains characters 'R', 'P', or 'S', they will be mapped to 0, 1, or 2 respectively. The loop will execute based on the length of the input string. 
Output State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `S` is a list containing the mapped values based on the input**
