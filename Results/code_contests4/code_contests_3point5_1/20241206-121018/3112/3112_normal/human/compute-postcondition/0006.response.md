Example Answer:
`count` is assigned a list containing 0 repeated 3 times. Since `count` is a list, the values are [0, 0, 0]. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `S` is a list containing the mapped values based on the input, `count` is a list containing [0, 0, 0]**
