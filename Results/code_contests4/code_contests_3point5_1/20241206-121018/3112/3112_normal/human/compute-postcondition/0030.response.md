According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `maxi` is decremented by 2 and the character at index 1 in 'RPS' is printed and multiplied by the length of `S`. To execute the loop one more time, `maxi` needs to be decremented by 2 again and the same character at index 1 in 'RPS' should be printed and multiplied by the length of `S` again.
State: **`maxi` is decremented by 4, the character at index 1 in 'RPS' is printed and multiplied by the length of `S`**
