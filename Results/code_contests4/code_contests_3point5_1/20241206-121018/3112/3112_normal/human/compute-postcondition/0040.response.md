Example Answer:
The `maxi` variable is assigned the index of the maximum value in the range(3) based on the counts of each character in the `count` list. The character at index 1 in 'RPS' is 'P'. The length of `S` is the number of elements in the list created based on the input string and the `mapper` dictionary. The `count` list contains the final count of occurrences of each character in `S`. 
Output State: **`maxi` is assigned the index of the maximum value in range(3), character at index 1 in 'RPS' is printed and multiplied by the length of `S`, `S` is a new list created based on the input string and the `mapper` dictionary, `count` is a list containing the final count of occurrences of each character in `S`.**
