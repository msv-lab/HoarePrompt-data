Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It maps the input string to numerical values representing 'R', 'P', and 'S', counts the occurrences of each choice, selects the choice that occurs most frequently, adjusts it to make sure it wins against the most frequent choice of the bot, and then prints this choice for each round. This strategy ensures that the player maximizes the average number of wins over the rounds, as stated in the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases and follows the logic outlined in the problem description, making it correct.
