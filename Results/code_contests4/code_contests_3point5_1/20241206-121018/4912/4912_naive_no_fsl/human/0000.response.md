Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect as it does not solve the problem described. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem involving dynamic programming rather than identifying the festival name as required by the problem description. Additionally, the input format does not match the problem description, and the logic of the program does not align with the festival name extraction task. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the given problem.
