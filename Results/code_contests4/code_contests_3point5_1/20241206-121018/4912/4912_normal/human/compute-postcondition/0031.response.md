Example Answer:
`one` is appended to the list `temp`, where `one` is either 1 or 0. The previous values of the variables are `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a list containing the value of one, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 0, `temp` is a list containing 0, `tar` is 1, `i` is 2. After execution, the value of `temp` becomes [0, one]. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a list containing the value of one, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 0, `temp` is a list containing 0 and the value of `one`, `tar` is 1, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a list containing the value of one, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 0, `temp` is a list containing 0 and the value of `one`, `tar` is 1, `i` is 2**
