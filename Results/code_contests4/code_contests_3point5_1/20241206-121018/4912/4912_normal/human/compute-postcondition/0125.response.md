Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum ASCII value among `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`. The length of string `x` is still `m`, and list `f` remains empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` holds the maximum ASCII value among `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`; `m` is the length of string `x`; `f` is empty.
Output State: **`temp` holds the maximum ASCII value among `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`; `m` is the length of string `x`; `f` is empty**
