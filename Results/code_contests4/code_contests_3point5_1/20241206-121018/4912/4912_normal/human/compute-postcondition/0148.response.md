Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters, then processes the string based on certain conditions. It calculates the maximum values from subsets of the processed data and sums these maximum values overall. The final result is printed as the total sum. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input data provided during execution.**
