Example Answer:
The value of `f` appends the result of x[i + 1] + max(f[i - 2][0], f[i - 3][0]). Since `i` starts at 3, x[i + 1] refers to x[4]. The value of `m` is at least 4, so x[4] exists. The max function compares the values of f[i - 2][0] and f[i - 3][0]. Since `i` starts at 3, f[1][0] and f[0][0] are compared. The output state will depend on the specific values of x[4], f[1][0], and f[0][0].
Output State: **The specific output state will depend on the values of x[4], f[1][0], and f[0][0].**
