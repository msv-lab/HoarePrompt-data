Output State: **`temp` is an integer, `m` is the length of string `x`, `f` contains a list with elements `x[0]` and `x[1]`. If `m` is equal to 3, `temp` holds the maximum ASCII value among `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`. If `m == 4`, `temp` holds the maximum value between the sum of `x[0]` and `x[2]` and the sum of `x[3]` and the maximum value between `x[0]` and `x[1]`.**
