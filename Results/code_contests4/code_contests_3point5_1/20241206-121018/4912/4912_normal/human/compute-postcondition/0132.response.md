According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 4. 

Before the loop starts, `temp` is an integer, `m` is the length of string `x`, `f` contains a list with elements `x[0]` and `x[1]`, and `f` now also contains a new list with `x[1]` and the maximum value between `x[2]` and `x[0]`, and an error occurs while trying to append elements to `f`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `m` should be at least 4, `temp` should be initialized, and `f` should be able to handle additional elements being appended to it without causing an error.
State: **`temp` is an integer, `m` is at least 4, `f` is able to handle additional elements being appended, for the loop to execute `i` starts at 3**
