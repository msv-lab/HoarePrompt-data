Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is assigned 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state.
Output State: **`S` is a string ending with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` contains lists of values, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 0, `temp` is 0, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is n-1, for the loop to execute the first time `res` has at least 1 list, `x` is the first list in `res`**
