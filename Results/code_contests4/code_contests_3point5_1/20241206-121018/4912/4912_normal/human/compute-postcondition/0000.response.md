Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string S is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL'; `n` is an input integer**
