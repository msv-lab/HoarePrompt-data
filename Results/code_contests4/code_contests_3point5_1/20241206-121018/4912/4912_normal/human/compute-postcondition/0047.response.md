Example Answer:
The `temp` list is copied and appended to the `res` list. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` contains the value of one and updated `temp` list based on the condition, `count` is 0, updated `one` based on conditions, `temp` is updated accordingly, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `temp` list contains the value of `one`, `res` list contains the copied `temp` list.
Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` contains the value of one and updated `temp` list based on the condition, `count` is 0, updated `one` based on conditions, `temp` is updated accordingly, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `temp` list contains the value of `one`, `res` list contains the copied `temp` list**
