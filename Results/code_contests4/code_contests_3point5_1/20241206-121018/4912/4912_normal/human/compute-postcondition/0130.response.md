Example Answer:
`f` appends a new list containing `x[1]` and the maximum value between `x[2]` and `x[0]`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an integer, `m` is the length of string `x`, `f` contains a list with elements `x[0]` and `x[1]`, and `f` now also contains a new list with `x[1]` and the maximum value between `x[2]` and `x[0]`.
Output State: **`temp` is an integer, `m` is the length of string `x`, `f` contains a list with elements `x[0]` and `x[1]`, and `f` now also contains a new list with `x[1]` and the maximum value between `x[2]` and `x[0]`.**
