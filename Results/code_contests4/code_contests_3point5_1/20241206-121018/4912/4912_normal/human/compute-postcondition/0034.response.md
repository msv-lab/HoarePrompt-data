Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is copied and appended to the `res` list. Since `temp` contains 0 and one, the `res` list will now contain a copy of the `temp` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a list containing the value of one and a copy of the `temp` list, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 0, `temp` is a list containing 0 and one, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a list containing the value of one and a copy of the `temp` list, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 0, `temp` is a list containing 0 and one, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2**
