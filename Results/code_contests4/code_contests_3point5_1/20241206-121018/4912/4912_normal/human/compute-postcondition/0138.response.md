According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `i` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is unknown, but it is within the range of 3 to m - 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be between 4 and m - 1.
State: **Unknown, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be between 4 and m - 1**
