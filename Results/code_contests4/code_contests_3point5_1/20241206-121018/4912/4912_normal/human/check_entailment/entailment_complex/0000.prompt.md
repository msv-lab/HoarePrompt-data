You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Rng is going to a festival.

The name of the festival is given to you as a string S, which ends with `FESTIVAL`, from input. Answer the question: "Rng is going to a festival of what?" Output the answer.

Here, assume that the name of "a festival of s" is a string obtained by appending `FESTIVAL` to the end of s. For example, `CODEFESTIVAL` is a festival of `CODE`.

Constraints

* 9 \leq |S| \leq 50
* S consists of uppercase English letters.
* S ends with `FESTIVAL`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL'.**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    res = []
    count = 0
    if (s[0] == '1') :
        one = 1
    else :
        one = 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ends with 'FESTIVAL'; n is an input integer; res is an empty list; count is 0. If the first character of S is '1', one is 1. If the first character of S is not '1', one is 0.
    temp = []
    tar = 0
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if s[i - 1:i + 2] == '101':
            tar = 1
            temp.append(one)
            one = 0
        else:
            if s[i] == '0' and tar == 1:
                temp.append(one)
                res.append(temp.copy())
                temp = []

                one = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` contains lists of values based on the conditions, `count` is 0, `one` is either 1 or 0 based on the conditions, `temp` is an updated list based on conditions, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is n-1.

    if (tar == 1) :

    for x in res:
        temp = 0

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` is a string ending with 'FESTIVAL', `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` contains lists of values, `count` is the sum of the maximum values calculated in each iteration, `one` is either 1 or 0, `temp` holds the maximum value calculated in each iteration, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is n-1, `x` is the last list in `res`, `m` is the length of `x`, `f` contains the updated appended values based on the conditions mentioned in the loop
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters, then processes the string based on certain conditions. It calculates the maximum values from subsets of the processed data and sums these maximum values overall. The final result is printed as the total sum. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input data provided during execution.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
