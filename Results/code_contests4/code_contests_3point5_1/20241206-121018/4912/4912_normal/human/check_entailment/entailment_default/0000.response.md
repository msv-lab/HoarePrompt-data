Correctness: **False**

The given code does not seem to follow the problem description. The problem description asks for identifying the festival Rng is going to, which is the part of the string before the word "FESTIVAL". However, the code provided seems to be a different program altogether. There is no reference to the word "FESTIVAL" in the code, and it performs calculations based on certain conditions that are not related to identifying the festival.

Therefore, based on the discrepancy between the code and the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed False.
