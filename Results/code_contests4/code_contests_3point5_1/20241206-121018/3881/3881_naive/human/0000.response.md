Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads pairs of a word and a page number and stores them in a dictionary where the word is the key and the page numbers are stored in a list.
2. It then iterates over the dictionary keys (words) in sorted order and prints the word followed by the sorted list of page numbers.
3. The program handles the input format correctly by splitting each line into a word and a page number.
4. It correctly appends the page number to the list of page numbers corresponding to the word.
5. The program sorts the page numbers in ascending order before printing.
6. The program exits after processing all the input pairs.
7. The output format also matches the expected format of word followed by a list of page numbers.
