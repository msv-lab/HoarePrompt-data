Example Answer: 
The code appends the integer value of `page` to the list associated with the key `word` in the `index` defaultdict. The previous state of `index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing integer values. After execution, the list associated with the key `word` will have the additional integer value of `page`. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of this iteration, `index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer values of `page` as the value.
Output State: **At the end of this iteration, `index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer values of `page` as the value.**
