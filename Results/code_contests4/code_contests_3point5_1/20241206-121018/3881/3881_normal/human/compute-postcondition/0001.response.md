According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are input lines coming from the standard input (stdin). Since we cannot predict the exact number of lines coming from stdin, we need to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that there is at least one line available in the standard input.
State: **`index` is an empty defaultdict that will store lists, for the loop to execute there is at least one line available in the standard input**
