According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as there are more keys in the `index` defaultdict. At the end of the last iteration, `index` has at least 1 key, `word` is the first key in the sorted `index`, and the list associated with the `word` key contains all the integer values of `page` appended throughout all iterations of the loop. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next `word` key in the sorted `index` should be selected. This means that the state needs to be adjusted such that the current `word` key is removed from consideration and the next key in the sorted `index` becomes the new `word`.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with at least 1 key (excluding the current `word` key), the next key in the sorted `index` becomes the new `word`, the list associated with the new `word` key contains all the integer values of `page` appended throughout all iterations of the loop**
