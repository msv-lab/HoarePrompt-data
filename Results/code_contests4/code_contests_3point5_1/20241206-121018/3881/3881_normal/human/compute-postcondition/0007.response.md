According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines to read from the standard input. The state at the end of the previous iteration includes `index` as a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer values of `page` as the value. To execute the loop one more time, the next line from the standard input needs to be read.
State: **At the end of this iteration, the next line from the standard input needs to be read**
