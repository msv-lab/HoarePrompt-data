According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in the `index` defaultdict. If there are more keys to iterate through, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the list associated with the `word` key in the `index` defaultdict is printed in sorted order. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next key in sorted order after the last key iterated must be selected. 

State: **Output State: The list associated with the next key in sorted order in the `index` defaultdict is printed in sorted order**
