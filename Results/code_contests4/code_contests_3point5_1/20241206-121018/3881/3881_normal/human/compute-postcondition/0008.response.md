Example Answer:
`word` and `page` are assigned values by splitting the `line` variable. The `line` variable is not given in the initial state, so it cannot be determined what values `word` and `page` will hold. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of this iteration, the next line from the standard input needs to be read.
Output State: **At the end of this iteration, the next line from the standard input needs to be read**
