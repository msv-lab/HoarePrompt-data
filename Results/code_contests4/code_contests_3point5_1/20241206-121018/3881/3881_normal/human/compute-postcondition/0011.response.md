According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `index` defaultdict has at least 1 key. So, before the loop starts, the `index` defaultdict needs to have at least 1 key. At the start of the loop, the loop variable `word` will be the first key in the sorted `index`. Additionally, the list associated with the `word` key should contain all the integer values of `page` that have been appended throughout all iterations of the loop so far.

State: **`index` is a defaultdict with at least 1 key, `word` is the first key in the sorted `index`, the list associated with the `word` key contains all the integer values of `page` appended throughout all iterations of the loop**
