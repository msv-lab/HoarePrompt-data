Example Answer:
`word` and `page` are assigned values by splitting the `line` variable. The `line` is read from the standard input. After this assignment, the `index` defaultdict will be updated with the new `word` as key and the `page` converted to an integer as the value in a list. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of this iteration, `index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer value of `page` as the value.
Output State: **At the end of this iteration, `index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer value of `page` as the value.**
