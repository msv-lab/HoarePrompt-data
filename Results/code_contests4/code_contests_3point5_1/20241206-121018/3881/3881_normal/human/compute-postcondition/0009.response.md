Example Answer:
The code appends the integer value of `page` to the list stored at the key `word` in the dictionary `index`. If `index[word]` does not exist, a new key-value pair is created with `word` as the key and a list containing `page` as the value. Therefore, the Output State is: index[word] contains the appended integer value of page.
Output State: **index[word] contains the appended integer value of page**
