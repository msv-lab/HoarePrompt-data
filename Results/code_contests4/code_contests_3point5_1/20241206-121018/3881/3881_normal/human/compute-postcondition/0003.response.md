Example Answer: 
The code appends the integer value of `page` to the list stored in `index[word]`. The values of `word` and `page` are determined by input, so the output state will depend on those inputs.
Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer value of `page` as the value**
