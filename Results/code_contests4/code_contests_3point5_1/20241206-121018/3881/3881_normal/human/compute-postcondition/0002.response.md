Example Answer:
The variables `word` and `page` are assigned values by splitting the input `line` based on whitespace. The values of `word` and `page` depend on the input provided, so their specific values cannot be determined without knowing the input. The `index` defaultdict remains empty until values are added to it during the loop execution.
Output State: **`index` is an empty defaultdict, `word` and `page` values are determined by input from `line.split()`**
