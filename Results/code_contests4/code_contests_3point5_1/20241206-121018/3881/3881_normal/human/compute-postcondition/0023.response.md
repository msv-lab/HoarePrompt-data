Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads word-page pairs from the standard input, creates a dictionary where each word is a key mapped to a list of corresponding page numbers. It then prints each word followed by its associated page numbers in sorted order. The function does not accept any parameters and terminates after processing the input.**
