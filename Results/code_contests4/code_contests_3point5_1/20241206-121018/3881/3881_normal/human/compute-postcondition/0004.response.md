According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more lines to be read from the standard input. At the end of the last iteration, the `index` defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer value of `page` as the value. To execute the loop one more time, you need to adjust the state so that there is at least one more line to be read from the standard input.
State: **At the end of the previous iteration, `index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing the integer value of `page` as the value, there is at least one more line to be read from the standard input for the loop to execute one more time**
