Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly reads a list of pairs of a word and a page number, creates a dictionary where each word is a key mapped to a list of corresponding page numbers, and then prints each word followed by its associated page numbers in alphabetical order for words and ascending order for page numbers. The program ensures that each word appears only once on a page and handles the input constraints specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
