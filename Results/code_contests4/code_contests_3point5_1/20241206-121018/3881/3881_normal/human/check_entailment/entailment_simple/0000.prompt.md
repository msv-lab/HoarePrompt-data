You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Books are indexed. Write a program which reads a list of pairs of a word and a page number, and prints the word and a list of the corresponding page numbers.

You can assume that a word consists of at most 30 characters, and the page number is less than or equal to 1000. The number of pairs of a word and a page number is less than or equal to 100. A word never appear in a page more than once.

The words should be printed in alphabetical order and the page numbers should be printed in ascending order.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each pair consists of a word (string) and a page number (integer), where the word has at most 30 characters and the page number is less than or equal to 1000. The number of pairs is less than or equal to 100. Each word appears on a page number at most once.
def func_1():
    index = defaultdict(list)
    for line in stdin:
        word, page = line.split()
        
        index[word].append(int(page))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `index` is a defaultdict with `word` as key and a list containing all the integer values of `page` appended throughout all iterations of the loop.
    for word in sorted(index):
        print(word)
        
        print(*sorted(index[word]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `index` is a defaultdict with all keys sorted, each key's associated list is printed in sorted order containing all the integer values of `page` appended throughout all iterations of the loop.
    exit()

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
