Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads word-page pairs from the standard input and correctly creates a dictionary where each word is a key mapped to a list of corresponding page numbers.
- It then prints each word followed by its associated page numbers in sorted order, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles the input constraints where a word consists of at most 30 characters and the page number is less than or equal to 1000.
- The code ensures that a word never appears on a page more than once.
- The output is formatted as expected, with words printed in alphabetical order and page numbers in ascending order.
- The code uses the defaultdict data structure to efficiently store the word-page pairs.

Overall, the code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.
