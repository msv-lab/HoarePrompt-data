The function `func_2` accepts a list `s` with at least one element. It iterates through the characters of the joined string of `s`, processing mathematical operations and updating a list `f`. If a non-empty string `n` is encountered, it calls a function `func_1` with the corresponding value from dictionary `v` and updates `f[0]`. Finally, it evaluates the expression stored in `f[0]` and returns its level. However, there are potential issues with the clarity of the code and the handling of certain edge cases that need further clarification and verification.
