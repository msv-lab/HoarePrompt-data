According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `c`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `f` is a list containing the result of appending the output of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` to the last element with the value updated by `m` if `c == ')'`, or with the character `c` if `c == '('`. `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, `c` is one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')', and `m` is assigned the value of `func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])` if `c == ')'`, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `c` is not in the characters '+-*/()', `f` is a list containing one element `''`, `n` is `c`, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in the joined string must be considered. 

State: **`f` is a list containing the result of appending the output of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` to the last element with the value updated by `m` if `c == ')'`, or with the character `c` if `c == '('`, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, the next character `c` in the joined string should be considered**
