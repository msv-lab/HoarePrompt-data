Example Answer:
The value at the last index of list `f` is updated by adding the result of `func_1` with the value obtained from dictionary `v` by using `n` as the key. If `n` is not found in the dictionary `v`, then '1' is used as the default value. The next character `c` from the joined string is appended to `n`. Given the initial state, the output state can be determined.
Output State: **`f` is a list with the last element updated, `n` has been appended with the next character `c`, `s` is a list with at least one element and the joined string is not empty**
