Postcondition: ***`f` is a list with the last element updated. If `c` is equal to '(', the last element of `f` is updated to an empty string. If `c` is equal to ')', the last element of `f` is popped and added with the result of the evaluated expression `m`. `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, and the next character `c` in the joined string should be considered. `m` is assigned the result of the evaluated expression. If `c` is not equal to ')', the last element of `f` is updated with the next character `c`.***
