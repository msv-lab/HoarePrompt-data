According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string resulting from joining the elements of list `s`. The loop will execute if the joined string is not empty. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- The list `s` should have at least one element.
- The joined string should not be empty.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to:
State: **`f` is a list containing one element `''`, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty**
