Postcondition: ***`f` is a list as described in the previous iteration, `n` has been appended with the character `c`, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, and the next character `c` in the joined string should be considered. If `c` is in '+-*/()', the last element of `f` is updated accordingly based on the value of `c` as described in the if part. `m` is assigned the result of the evaluated expression. If `c` is not in '+-*/()', `f` remains unchanged and `n` is incremented by `c`.***
