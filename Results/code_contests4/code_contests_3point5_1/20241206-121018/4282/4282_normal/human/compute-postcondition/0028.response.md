Postcondition: ***`f` is a list after modification, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, and the next character `c` in the joined string should be considered. If `c == ')'`, the last element of list `f` is incremented by `m`. If `c != ')'`, `f` is a list containing the result of appending the output of `func_1('1')` to the last element with the value updated by `m` if `c == ')'`, or with the character `c` if `c == '('`.***
