Example Answer:
The last element of list `f` is updated by appending the result of `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`. The value of `n` is an empty string, so the result of `v.get(n, '1')` is `'1'`. Therefore, the last element of `f` will be updated by appending the result of `func_1('1')`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`f` is a list containing the result of appending the output of `func_1('1')` to the last element, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, the next character `c` in the joined string should be considered**
