Example Answer:
`func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])` is assigned to `m`. The value of `f` is modified by popping the last element, evaluating it, and checking if the level is '0'. The result of `func_1` is then used along with the above condition to determine the value assigned to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list after modification, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, `c` is the next character in the joined string to be considered.
Output State: **`f` is a list after modification, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, `c` is the next character in the joined string to be considered**
