Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing the final result of the operations performed within the loop, `n` is a string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, and all characters in the joined string have been considered. If `n` is not an empty string, `f[0]` is updated with the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.***
