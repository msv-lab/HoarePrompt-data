The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list with at least one element. The program updates the first element of list `f` with the result of calling another function `func_1` with the value obtained by accessing the dictionary `v` with key `n`, where `n` is a string value. The program then returns the level of the evaluated expression stored in the updated first element of list `f`.
