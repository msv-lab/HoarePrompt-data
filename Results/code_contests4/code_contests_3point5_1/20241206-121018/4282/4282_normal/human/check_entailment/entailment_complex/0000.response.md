Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description. There are potential issues with the clarity of the code and the handling of certain edge cases that need further clarification and verification. The function `func_2` processes the input expression by iterating through the characters, performing mathematical operations, and evaluating the final result. However, there are complexities in the code logic that may lead to incorrect evaluation of expressions, especially in cases involving nested brackets and multiple operations.

To validate the correctness of the code, we need to thoroughly test it with various input expressions that involve nested brackets, multiple operations, and different macro substitutions. Since the code may have issues handling these scenarios according to the problem description, we cannot confidently say that the code is correct without further verification.
