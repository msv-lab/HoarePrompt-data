Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle the case where the expression contains nested parentheses. The function func_2 does not properly handle nested parentheses when evaluating the expression. This is an edge case that the code does not handle correctly, making the program incorrect. The output hints do not mention this specific case, so it is important to verify the code based on the description of the problem.
