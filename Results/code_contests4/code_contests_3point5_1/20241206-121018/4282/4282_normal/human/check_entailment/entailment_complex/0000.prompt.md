You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Most C/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.

In this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:

#define macro_name macro_value

After the macro has been declared, "macro_name" is replaced with "macro_value" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. "macro_name" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A "macro_value" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.

One of the main problems arising while using macros — the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.

Let's consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:

#define sum x + y

and further in the program the expression "2 * sum" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get "2 * x + y", instead of intuitively expected "2 * (x + y)".

Let's call the situation "suspicious", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.

Let's speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a "safe" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise — suspicious.

Note that we consider the "/" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C/C++. That's why, for example, in the expression "a*(b/c)" we can omit brackets to get the expression "a*b/c".

Input

The first line contains the only number n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the amount of #define constructions in the given program.

Then there follow n lines, each of them contains just one #define construction. Each construction has the following syntax:

#define name expression

where

  * name — the macro name, 
  * expression — the expression with which the given macro will be replaced. An expression is a non-empty string, containing digits,names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets and operational signs +-*/. It is guaranteed that the expression (before and after macros substitution) is a correct arithmetic expression, having no unary operations. The expression contains only non-negative integers, not exceeding 109. 



All the names (#define constructions' names and names of their arguments) are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters. It is guaranteed that the name of any variable is different from any #define construction.

Then, the last line contains an expression that you are to check. This expression is non-empty and satisfies the same limitations as the expressions in #define constructions.

The input lines may contain any number of spaces anywhere, providing these spaces do not break the word "define" or the names of constructions and variables. In particular, there can be any number of spaces before and after the "#" symbol.

The length of any line from the input file does not exceed 100 characters.

Output

Output "OK", if the expression is correct according to the above given criterion, otherwise output "Suspicious".

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a non-negative integer. Each #define construction has the syntax "#define name expression" where name is a string representing the macro name, and expression is a correct arithmetic expression. The input expression to check is also a correct arithmetic expression. All names are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters, and the expression contains digits, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/.

def func_1(c):
    return 'macro("' + c + '")'
    #The program returns a string that is a macro with the input variable 'c' included in the parentheses.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a string c and returns a string that represents a macro with c included in the parentheses. The code does not have any edge cases or missing functionality as the annotation accurately describes the behavior of the function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    f, n = [''], ''

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a list containing the final result of the operations performed within the loop, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, and all characters in the joined string have been considered.
    if (n != '') :
        f[0] += func_1(v.get(n, '1'))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is a list containing the final result of the operations performed within the loop, `n` is a string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, and all characters in the joined string have been considered. If `n` is not an empty string, `f[0]` is updated with the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.
    return eval(f[0]).level
    #The program returns the level of the evaluated expression stored in the first element of list `f` after updating `f[0]` with the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` where `n` is a string and `s` is a list with at least one element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `s` with at least one element. It iterates through the characters of the joined string of `s`, processing mathematical operations and updating a list `f`. If a non-empty string `n` is encountered, it calls a function `func_1` with the corresponding value from dictionary `v` and updates `f[0]`. Finally, it evaluates the expression stored in `f[0]` and returns its level. However, there are potential issues with the clarity of the code and the handling of certain edge cases that need further clarification and verification.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
