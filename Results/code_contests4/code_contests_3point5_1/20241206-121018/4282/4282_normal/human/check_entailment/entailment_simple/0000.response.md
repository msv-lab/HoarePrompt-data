Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not fully implement the problem description. The program seems to be attempting to evaluate arithmetic expressions involving macros by replacing them with their corresponding values. However, there are some issues with the implementation:

1. The program does not handle the situation where the order of calculation changes due to different priorities of operations after macro substitution. This is a critical aspect of the problem description that is not addressed in the program.

2. The program uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the expressions, which is not a safe practice as it can lead to security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use a safer method to evaluate arithmetic expressions.

3. The program lacks clear logic to properly handle the replacement of macros in the expression and ensure that the order of operations is maintained correctly.

Due to these issues, the program does not fully align with the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
