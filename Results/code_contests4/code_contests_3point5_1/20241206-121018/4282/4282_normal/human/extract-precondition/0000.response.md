**Precondition:**

**n is a non-negative integer representing the number of #define constructions in the program.**

**Each #define construction has a name and an expression in the form "#define name expression".**

**The expression in each #define construction is a correct arithmetic expression with digits, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/.**

**The names of variables, #define constructions, and their arguments are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters.**

**The expression to check at the end is a non-empty string that satisfies the same limitations as the expressions in #define constructions.**
