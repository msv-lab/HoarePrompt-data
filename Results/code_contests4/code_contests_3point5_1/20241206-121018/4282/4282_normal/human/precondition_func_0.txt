**Precondition**: **n is a non-negative integer. Each #define construction has the syntax "#define name expression" where name is a string representing the macro name, and expression is a correct arithmetic expression. The input expression to check is also a correct arithmetic expression. All names are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters, and the expression contains digits, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/. The expression (before and after macro substitution) is guaranteed to be a correct arithmetic expression without unary operations, containing only non-negative integers not exceeding 10^9.**
