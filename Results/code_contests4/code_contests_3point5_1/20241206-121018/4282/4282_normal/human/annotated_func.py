#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a non-negative integer. Each #define construction has the syntax "#define name expression" where name is a string representing the macro name, and expression is a correct arithmetic expression. The input expression to check is also a correct arithmetic expression. All names are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters, and the expression contains digits, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/. The expression (before and after macro substitution) is guaranteed to be a correct arithmetic expression without unary operations, containing only non-negative integers not exceeding 10^9.**
def func_1(c):
    return 'macro("' + c + '")'
    #The program returns a string that is a macro with the input variable 'c' included in the parentheses.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a string c and returns a string that represents a macro with c included in the parentheses. The code does not have any edge cases or missing functionality as the annotation accurately describes the behavior of the function.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is a list containing the final result of the operations performed within the loop, `n` is a string, `s` is a list with at least one element, the joined string is not empty, and all characters in the joined string have been considered. If `n` is not an empty string, `f[0]` is updated with the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.
    return eval(f[0]).level
    #The program returns the level of the evaluated expression stored in the first element of list `f` after updating `f[0]` with the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` where `n` is a string and `s` is a list with at least one element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `s` with at least one element. It iterates through the characters of the joined string of `s`, processing mathematical operations and updating a list `f`. If a non-empty string `n` is encountered, it calls a function `func_1` with the corresponding value from dictionary `v` and updates `f[0]`. Finally, it evaluates the expression stored in `f[0]` and returns its level. However, there are potential issues with the clarity of the code and the handling of certain edge cases that need further clarification and verification.
