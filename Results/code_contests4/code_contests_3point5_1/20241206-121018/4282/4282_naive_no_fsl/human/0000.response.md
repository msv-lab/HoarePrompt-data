Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes the #define constructions, and then checks if the given expression is correct or suspicious based on the rules provided.

The program uses a class `macro` to handle the arithmetic operations and levels of precedence. It then defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to process the input strings and perform the necessary substitutions. Finally, it iterates through the input, processes the expressions, and outputs "OK" if the expression is correct, and "Suspicious" otherwise.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately, and there are no evident cases where it does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
