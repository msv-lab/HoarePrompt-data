Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integers `n` and `m`, processes banned cell coordinates `ban`, and calculates a value `ans` based on the problem description.
- It iterates over the rows and columns, updating their values based on the banned cells, ensuring that chips are not placed on banned cells.
- The code then calculates the sum of specific values for pairs of rows and columns, taking into account the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
- If `n` is odd and the middle row or column is not banned, it increments the sum by 1, handling this edge case as stated in the problem.
- Finally, it prints the calculated `ans` correctly as the maximum points Gerald can earn in the game. 

Based on the code implementation and the problem description, the code covers all potential cases and works correctly.
