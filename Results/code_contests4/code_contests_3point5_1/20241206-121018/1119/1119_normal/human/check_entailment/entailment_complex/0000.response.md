Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input integers `n` and `m`, processes the banned cell coordinates, and calculates the maximum points Gerald can earn in the game by following the specified rules. The program updates the values of rows and columns based on the banned cells and then calculates the sum of specific values for pairs of rows and columns. It also handles the case where `n` is odd and the middle row or column is not banned.

The program covers all the conditions described in the problem, ensuring that Gerald earns the maximum points possible while adhering to the game rules. Thus, the program is correct in its implementation.
