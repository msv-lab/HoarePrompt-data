Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the maximum points Gerald can earn in the game by considering the banned cells and placing chips strategically on the border cells. The program ensures that Gerald does not lose by falling into a banned cell, having two chips on the same cell, or having two chips swap positions in a minute.

The program handles both even and odd values of `n` and correctly calculates the maximum points that Gerald can earn. It traverses through the border cells and checks for banned cells to determine the number of chips that can be safely placed.

Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the expected output for the given inputs.
