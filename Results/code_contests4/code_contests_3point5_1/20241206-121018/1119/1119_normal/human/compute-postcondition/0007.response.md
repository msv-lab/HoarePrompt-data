According to the code, the loop iterates over the `ban` list with tuples containing `(x, y)`. If there are more tuples in `ban`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in `ban`.
State: **`r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0, the loop continues iterating over `ban` with one more tuple**
