Postcondition: ***`r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0 for all x, y in `ban`, `i` is `n//2`, `ans` is the sum of specified values for all `i` from 2 to `n//2` with an additional 1 added. If `n` is odd and either `r[(n + 1) // 2]` or `c[(n + 1) // 2]` is non-zero, then the program enters the if condition and the state remains the same.***
