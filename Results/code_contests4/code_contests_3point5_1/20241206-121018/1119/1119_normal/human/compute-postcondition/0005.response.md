According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, and `ban`. If there are more elements in `ban` to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, there must be more elements in `ban` to iterate over, so the next elements in `ban` will determine the next values of `x` and `y`.
State: **`r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0, for the loop to execute another time, there must be more elements in `ban` to iterate over**
