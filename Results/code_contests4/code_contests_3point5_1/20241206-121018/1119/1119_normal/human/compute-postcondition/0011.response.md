Example Answer:
The `ans` variable is incremented by the sum of four values: `r[i]`, `r[n - i + 1]`, `c[i]`, and `c[n - i + 1]`. Since `i` is 2, the values of `r[2]`, `r[n - 2 + 1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[n - 2 + 1]` are used in the sum. Given that `r[2]` and `c[2]` are both 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to run, the output state is:
`r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0 for all x, y in `ban`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is the sum of `r[2]`, `r[n - 2 + 1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[n - 2 + 1]`.
Output State: **`r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0 for all x, y in `ban`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is the sum of `r[2]`, `r[n - 2 + 1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[n - 2 + 1]`.**
