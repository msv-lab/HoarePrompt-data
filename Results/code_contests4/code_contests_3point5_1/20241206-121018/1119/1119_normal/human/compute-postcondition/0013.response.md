Example Answer:
The sum of `r[2]`, `r[n - 2 + 1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[n - 2 + 1]` is added to `ans`. Since `i` is 3, the values being added are `r[3]`, `r[n - 3 + 1]`, `c[3]`, and `c[n - 3 + 1]`. The values of `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0 for all x, y in `ban`. The loop executes when `n` is greater than or equal to 5, so the sum of these values is added to `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0 for all x, y in `ban`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and `ans` is updated with the sum of the specified values.
Output State: **`r[x]` and `c[y]` are both 0 for all x, y in `ban`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `ans` is updated with the sum of specified values**
