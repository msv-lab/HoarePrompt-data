Example Answer: 
The variables `r[x]` and `c[y]` are both assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0, the loop continues iterating over `ban` with one more tuple.
Output State: **`r[x]` is 0, `c[y]` is 0, the loop continues iterating over `ban` with one more tuple**
