Functionality: **The function `func` reads input integers `n` and `m`, then processes banned cell coordinates `ban` and calculates a value `ans`. It iterates over the rows and columns, updating their values based on the banned cells. It then calculates the sum of specific values for pairs of rows and columns. If `n` is odd and the middle row or column is not banned, it increments the sum by 1. Finally, it prints the calculated `ans`. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
