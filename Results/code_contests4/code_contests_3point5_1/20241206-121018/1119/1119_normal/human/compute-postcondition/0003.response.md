According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ban`. If `ban` has at least 1 pair of values, the loop can execute. No changes need to be made to the initial state as `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` are assigned specific values based on the list comprehensions provided. Therefore, the state remains the same.
State: **No change in the initial state, for the loop to execute the first time `ban` has at least 1 pair of values**
