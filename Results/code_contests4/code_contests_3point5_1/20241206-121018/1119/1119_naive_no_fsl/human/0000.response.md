Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of chips Gerald can place on the board without losing the game based on the banned cells and the size of the field. It considers the conditions where Gerald would lose the game and adjusts the maximum points accordingly. The program iterates through the banned cells, sets the corresponding row and column flags to 0, and then calculates the maximum number of chips that can be placed based on the remaining available cells. Finally, it outputs the maximum points that can be earned.

Overall, the program covers all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
