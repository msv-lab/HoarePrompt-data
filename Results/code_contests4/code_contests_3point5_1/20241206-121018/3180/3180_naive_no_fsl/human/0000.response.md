Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the sequence length and the sequence itself.
2. It separates the even-indexed elements and odd-indexed elements into two separate lists.
3. It then uses Counter from the collections module to count the occurrences of each number in both lists.
4. It finds the most common element in each list and calculates the number of elements to be replaced based on the difference between the total number of elements in the list and the count of the most common element.
5. It stores the minimum number of replacements needed for all possible combinations of the two different numbers in the sequence and outputs the minimum value.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic correctly and provides the minimum number of replacements needed to make the sequence /\/\/\/.
