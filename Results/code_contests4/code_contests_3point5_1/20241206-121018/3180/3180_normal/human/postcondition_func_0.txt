The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `v` from the user input. It then separates the even and odd elements from the list, counts the frequencies of each, and identifies the most common elements. After this, it calculates the sum of the differences between the lengths of the even and odd lists and the frequencies of the most common elements. Finally, it prints the minimum sum calculated. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the user-provided inputs.
