Output State: **evenc_most_common, oddc_most_common, i, j are arrays. The element at index i of evenc_most_common is not equal to the element at index j of oddc_most_common. `a` is assigned the value of the length of `even` minus the second element of the tuple at index i of `evenc_most_common`. The values of `even`, `odd`, `m`, `a`, `b` are updated after the third iteration.**
