Example Answer:
The map function is used to apply the int function to each element of the input obtained by splitting the raw input based on spaces. The values entered are assigned to the variable v as a list of integers. Since the values of v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5, the list v contains these integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5.
Output State: **n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5**
