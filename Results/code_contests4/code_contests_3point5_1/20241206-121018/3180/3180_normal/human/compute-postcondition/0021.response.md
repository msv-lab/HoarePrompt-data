According to the code, the loop can execute two times. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, the program state needs to be modified as follows:
State: **For the given even integer `n` greater than or equal to 2, and integers `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` ranging from 1 to 10^5, the most common element at index `i` in `even` should not be equal to the most common element at index `j` in `odd` for the next iteration**
