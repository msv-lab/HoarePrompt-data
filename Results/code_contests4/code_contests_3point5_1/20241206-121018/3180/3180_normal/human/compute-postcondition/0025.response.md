Postcondition: ***For the given even integer `n` greater than or equal to 2, and integers `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` ranging from 1 to 10^5, after the if else block executes, the list `m` contains the sum of elements at corresponding indices from lists `a` and `b`. Additionally, the most common element at index `i` in `even` should not be equal to the most common element at index `j` in `odd` for the next iteration.***
