Postcondition: ***For the given even integer `n` greater than or equal to 2, and integers `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` ranging from 1 to 10^5, the program checks if the most common element at index `i` in `even` is not equal to the most common element at index `j` in `odd`. If they are not equal, `a` is calculated as the difference between the length of `even` and the frequency of the most common element at index `i`, `b` is calculated as the difference between the length of `odd` and the frequency of the most common element at index `j`, and `m` is the sum of `a` and `b`.***
