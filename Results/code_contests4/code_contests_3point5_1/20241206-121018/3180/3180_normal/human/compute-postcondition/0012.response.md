Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `v_1`, `v_2`, ..., `v_n` are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5, `even` contains elements at even indices of list `v`, `odd` contains elements at odd indices of list `v`, `evenc` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements at even indices of list `v`, `oddc` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements at odd indices of list `v`, `evenc_most_common` is a list of tuples containing the most common elements and their frequencies in `evenc` with the length equal to the number of unique elements in even, padded with a tuple containing (None, 0), `oddc_most_common` is assigned the most common elements and their frequencies in `oddc` with the length equal to the number of unique elements in odd, padded with a tuple containing (None, 0), for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, and the condition (`evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]`) is true, `a` is assigned the value of `len(even) - evenc_most_common[i][1]`**
