Example Answer:
The code appends the result of adding `a` and `b` to the list `m`. However, the initial state of variables `m`, `a`, and `b` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: The list `m` contains the result of adding `a` and `b`.
Output State: **The list `m` contains the result of adding `a` and `b`**
