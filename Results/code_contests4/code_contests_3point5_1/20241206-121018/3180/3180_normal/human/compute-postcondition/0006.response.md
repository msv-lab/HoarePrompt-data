Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5, `even` contains elements at even indices of list `v`, `odd` contains elements at odd indices of list `v`, `evenc` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements at even indices of list `v`, `oddc` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements at odd indices of list `v`, `evenc_most_common` is a list of tuples containing the most common elements and their frequencies in `evenc` with the length equal to the number of unique elements in `even`, padded with a tuple containing `(None, 0)` if necessary.**
