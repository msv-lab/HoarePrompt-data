Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the integer input. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and the values of v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5**
