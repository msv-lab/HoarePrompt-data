Example Answer: 
A new list `even` is created by iterating over the elements of list `v` and selecting only the elements at even indices. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5, we know that the list `v` contains `n` elements. Therefore, the `even` list will contain elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., n-2. The elements in the `even` list are extracted from the original list `v` based on their even indices. 
Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` are integers ranging from 1 to 10^5, `even` contains elements at even indices of list `v`**
