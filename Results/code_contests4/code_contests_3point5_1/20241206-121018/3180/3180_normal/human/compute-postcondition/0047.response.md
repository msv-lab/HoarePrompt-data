Postcondition: ***evenc_most_common, oddc_most_common, i, j are arrays. The element at index i of evenc_most_common is not equal to the element at index j of oddc_most_common. The states of even, odd, m, a, b after the third iteration are needed to determine the adjustments required for the loop to continue.***
