Postcondition: ***evenc_most_common, oddc_most_common, i, j remain unchanged. `a` is assigned the value of the length of `even` minus the second element of the tuple at index i of `evenc_most_common`. The arrays `even` and `odd`, and the variables `m`, `a`, `b` are updated after the third iteration with the appended value of a + b to array m, if the first element of the tuple at index i of `evenc_most_common` is not equal to the first element of the tuple at index j of `oddc_most_common`.***
