The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to perform a specific operation based on the constraints provided. Since the function does not accept any parameters, it is expected to operate on the predefined inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the function `func` is designed to work with the predefined even integer `n` greater than or equal to 2, and the integers `v_1, v_2, ..., v_n` ranging from 1 to 10^5. The function is expected to perform a certain operation or computation based on these inputs.
