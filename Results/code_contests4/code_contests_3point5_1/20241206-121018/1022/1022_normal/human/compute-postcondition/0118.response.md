Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the integer value of the binary string '1' repeated `la - i - 1` times. `axor` is then XORed with `tmp`. The previous values of `axor` and `tmp` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of the variables do not change but we convert the binary string '1' repeated `la - i - 1` times to an integer and assign it to `tmp`.
Output State: **The values of the variables do not change but we convert the binary string '1' repeated `la - i - 1` times to an integer and assign it to `tmp`**
