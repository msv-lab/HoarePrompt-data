Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables will be in the following state: `i` is equal to `n+2`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` has updated values at specific indices, `bit` is the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `axor` is the result of XOR operation with all elements of list `a`, `axor` is equal to 0, `axor` is the binary representation of `axor` without the '0b' prefix, `la` is the length of the binary representation of `axor`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n+2`, `axor[i]` equals '1', `cnt[i]` is either 0 or not equal to 0. If `cnt[i] == 0`, then `axor` remains unchanged. If `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, then `axor` is updated with `tmp` assigned the integer value of a string of '1's of length (la - i - 1). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `la`.***
