Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers representing the count of '1's in the corresponding positions of binary representations of integers in list `a` with updated values at specific indices, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation stored in `bit`, for the loop to execute again `lb` is at least 1 and the range specified in the `xrange` function covers valid indices of the binary representation in `bit`, and at index `j` in `bit`, the value is '1', `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1.***
