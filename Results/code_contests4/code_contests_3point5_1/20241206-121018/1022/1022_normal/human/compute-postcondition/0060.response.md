Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers representing the count of '1's in the corresponding positions of binary representations of integers in list `a` with updated values at specific indices. The loop is exited after the conditional statement.***
