Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` has updated values at specific indices, `bit` is the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `axor` is the result of XOR operation with all elements of list `a`, and `axor` is equal to 0. The program exits.***
