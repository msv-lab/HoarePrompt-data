According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the other states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to `n+1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` has updated values at specific indices, `bit` is the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `axor` is the result of XOR operation with all elements of list `a` up to index `i` where `axor` is XORed with `a[i]`.**
