Example Answer: 
A new list `cnt` is created with a length of `mxlba + 5` filled with zeros. The previous values of variables `n`, `a`, and `mxlba` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`**
