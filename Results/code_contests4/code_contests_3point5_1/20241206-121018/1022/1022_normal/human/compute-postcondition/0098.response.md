Output State: `i` is equal to `n+2`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` has updated values at specific indices, `bit` is the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `axor` is the result of XOR operation with all elements of list `a`, `axor` is equal to 0, `axor` is the binary representation of `axor` without the '0b' prefix, `la` is the length of the binary representation of `axor`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n+2`, `axor[i]` equals '1', `cnt[i]` is either 0 or not equal to 0, and `axor` is updated based on the conditions of the if-else block. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `la`. The code snippet `print(-1)` has no impact on the variables mentioned, so the Output State remains the same.
