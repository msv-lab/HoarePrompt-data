According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `mxlba` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `a` is a list of integers inputted. Additionally, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers inputted, `mxlba` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
