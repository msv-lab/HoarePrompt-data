Example Answer:
The binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a` is calculated and stored in the variable `bit`. The previous values of the affected variables are: At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of '1's in the corresponding position of binary representations of integers in list `a`, `bit` is the last binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`. 
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of '1's in the corresponding position of binary representations of integers in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`.**
