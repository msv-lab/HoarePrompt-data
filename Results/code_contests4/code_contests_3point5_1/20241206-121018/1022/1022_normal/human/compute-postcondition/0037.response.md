Output State: **At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers representing the count of '1's in the corresponding positions of binary representations of integers in list `a` with updated value at index `lb - 1 - j`, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a`, for the loop to execute `lb` is greater than or equal to 1. If the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in list `a` has a '1' at position `j`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Next iteration should have `j` as `lb - 2, `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented by 1.**
