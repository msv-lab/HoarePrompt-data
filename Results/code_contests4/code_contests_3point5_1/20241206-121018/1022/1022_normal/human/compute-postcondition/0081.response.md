Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to `n+1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` has updated values at specific indices, `bit` is the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `axor` is the result of XOR operation with all elements of list `a`, `axor` is equal to 0, `axor` is the binary representation of `axor` without the '0b' prefix, `la` is the length of the binary representation of `axor`, `ans` is 0, `i` is equal to `n+1` and `axor[i]` is equal to '1'***
