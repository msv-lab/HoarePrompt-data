Example Answer:
`axor` is updated by performing XOR operation with `a[i]`. The previous value of `axor` is XORed with `a[i]`, so `axor` is updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to `n+1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` has updated values at specific indices, `bit` is the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, and `axor` is the result of XOR operation with all elements of list `a` up to index `i` where `axor` is XORed with `a[i]`.
