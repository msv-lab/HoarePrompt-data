Example Answer:
The code `cnt[lb - 1 - j] += 1` increments the value at index `lb - 1 - j` of list `cnt` by 1. Initially, `j` is `lb - 2`, so the value at index `1` of list `cnt` is incremented by 1. After execution, the value at index `1` of list `cnt` is increased. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with some incremented values, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, for the loop to execute the second time `lb` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `lb - 2`, if `bit[j]` is '1', the loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with some incremented values (value at index 1 is increased), `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, for the loop to execute the second time `lb` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `lb - 2`**.
