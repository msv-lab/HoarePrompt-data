According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers inputted, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in the list `a`, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers inputted, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in the list `a`, `i` is 1** for the loop to execute a second time.
