Postcondition: ***`i`, `ans`, `cnt[i]` are integers. If `la - i - 1` equals 0, `i` is further increased by 1, `ans` is increased by 1, and `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1. This results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no changes to the values of `i`, `ans`, `cnt[i]`.***
