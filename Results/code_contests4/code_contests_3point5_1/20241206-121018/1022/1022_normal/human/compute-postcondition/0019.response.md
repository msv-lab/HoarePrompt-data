According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range specified by `xrange(lb - 1, -1, -1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `lb - 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with some incremented values, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, for the loop to execute the second time `lb` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `lb - 2`, if `bit[j]` is '1', the loop or if statement is broken out of.
