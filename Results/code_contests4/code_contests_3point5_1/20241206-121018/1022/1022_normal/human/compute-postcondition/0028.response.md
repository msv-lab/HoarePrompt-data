According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers where each element represents the count of '1's in the corresponding position of binary representations of integers in list `a`, `bit` is the last binary representation of the last integer in list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the last integer in list `a`.**
