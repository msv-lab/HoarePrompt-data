Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of binary representations in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of integers with some incremented values, `bit` is the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, `lb` is the length of the binary representation of the integer at index 0 of list `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `lb` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `lb - 1`, if `bit[j]` is '1', the loop or if statement is broken out of.***
