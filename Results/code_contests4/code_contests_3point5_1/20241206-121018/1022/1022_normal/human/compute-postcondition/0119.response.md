Example Answer:
The binary representation of `axor` is obtained using the `bin` function and then slicing off the first two characters to remove the '0b' prefix. The value of `axor` is not changed, but the binary representation is stored in `axor`. Therefore, the Output State is: the values of the variables do not change but the binary representation of `axor` is stored in `axor`.
Output State: **the values of the variables do not change but the binary representation of `axor` is stored in `axor`**
