Correctness: **True**

The program correctly computes the number of stones the cheater will eat in order to ensure a win in the game of Nim. It follows the problem description by manipulating the binary representations of the integers in the input list to determine the optimal strategy for the cheater. It handles the cases where the cheater cannot win the game even with cheating by returning -1. The program uses XOR operations and bitwise manipulations to determine the number of stones the cheater should eat.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and provides the correct output based on the given input.
