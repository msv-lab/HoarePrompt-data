Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values, iterates through all possible subsequences of 'hard' in the given statement, calculates the sum of corresponding values in the list `a`, and finds the minimum ambiguity by taking the minimum of these sums. It follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected output for all potential cases.
