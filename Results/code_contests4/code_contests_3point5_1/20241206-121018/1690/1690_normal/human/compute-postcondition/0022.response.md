Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either equal to `i` or incremented by 1 based on the conditions, `j` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
