According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1. Since `j` is the loop variable, it is increased by 1 for the next iteration. So, to execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, which means `j` should be less than `n - 1`.
State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n - 1`**
