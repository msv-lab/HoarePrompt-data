Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j`, `n` are all integers. `be` and `en` are greater than 0, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is different from `i`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `j` is an integer. If the element at index `j` in list `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`, the program continues with the updated values. Otherwise, the program proceeds to the next part without any changes.***
