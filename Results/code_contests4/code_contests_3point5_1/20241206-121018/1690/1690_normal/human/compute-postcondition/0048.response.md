Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` equals to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to either 2 or 1 based on the current value of `cur`.***
