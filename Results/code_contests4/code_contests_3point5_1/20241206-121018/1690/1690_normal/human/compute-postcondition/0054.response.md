Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is increased by the value of `a[j]`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is either -1 or 0. If `s[j]` matches `word[i]`, then the program variables will be in a state where `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`.***
