According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of `n-1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, so `j` will be `n-2`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is `n-2`.**
