Output State: **`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j`, `n` are integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by 1, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is set to 3, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by 1, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 2, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur`**.
