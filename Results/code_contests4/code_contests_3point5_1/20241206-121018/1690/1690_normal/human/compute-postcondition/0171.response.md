According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `en` is greater than `be`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the initial values of `be` and `en` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `be` should be decreased by 1 and `en` should be increased by 1.
State: **`be` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n - 1`, `cur` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same**
