According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since the loop is iterating over the range(4), it will execute 4 times in total. At the end of the last iteration, `tem` will be the sum of values in `a` corresponding to the characters in `s` that match 'hard' within the range of `be` to `en`, and `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. All other variables remain the same as their initial values.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **At the end of the loop, `tem` will be the sum of values in `a` corresponding to the characters in `s` that match 'hard' within the range of `be` to `en`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. All other variables remain the same as their initial values.**
