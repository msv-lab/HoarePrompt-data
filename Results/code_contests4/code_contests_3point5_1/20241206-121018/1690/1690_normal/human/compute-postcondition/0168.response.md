Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are adjusted to be 2 less than their current values, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same. If `cur == i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur != i`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are decreased by 2, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same. Additionally, `cur` is decreased by 1.***
