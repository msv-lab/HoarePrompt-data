According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is 3, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop is executing for the second time, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 1.
State: **`be` is incremented by the total number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by the total number of iterations of the loop, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j] == word[cur]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `cur` is 3, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `n` is greater than 1**
