Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, `j` is incremented by 2. The loop will execute another time if `j` is less than `n+1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `cur` is either incremented by 2 or set to `i`, `j` is incremented by 2, and the loop will execute another time if `j` is less than `n+1` and if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.***
