According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is set to 3, and `j` is now equal to `n-1`.
State: **`be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is set to 3, `j` is equal to `n-1`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
