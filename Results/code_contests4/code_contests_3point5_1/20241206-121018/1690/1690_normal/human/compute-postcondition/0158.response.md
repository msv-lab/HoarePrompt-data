According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be`, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j`, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be 1 less than its current value.
State: **`be`, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` is adjusted to be 1 less than its current value, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same**
