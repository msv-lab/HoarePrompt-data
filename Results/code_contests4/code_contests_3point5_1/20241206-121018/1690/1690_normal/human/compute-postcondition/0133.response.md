Postcondition: ***`be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is `not equal to `i` + 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur`]***
