Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either equal to `i` or incremented by 1 based on the conditions, `j` is incremented by 1. If the condition `cur == i` is satisfied, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to either `i+1` or `cur+1` based on the conditions. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `i+1` or `cur+1` depending on the conditions.***
