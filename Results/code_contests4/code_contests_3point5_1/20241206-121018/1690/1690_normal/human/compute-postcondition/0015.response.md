According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either equal to `i` or 1, `j` is 1**
