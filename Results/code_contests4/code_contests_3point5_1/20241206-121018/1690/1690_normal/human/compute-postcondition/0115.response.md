According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be`, `en`, `j`, `n`, `s`, and `word`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by the total number of iterations of the loop, `tem` is increased by the value of `a[j]`, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 3, `j` is `be`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **After the execution of the if statement, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by the total number of iterations of the loop, `tem` is increased by the value of `a[j]`, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 3, `j` is `be + 1`, for the loop to execute `be + 1` is less than `en`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[i`]**.
