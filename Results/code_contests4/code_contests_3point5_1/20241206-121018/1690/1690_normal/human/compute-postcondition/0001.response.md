Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints` is defined to take input from stdin, split it, convert each element to an integer, and return a list of those integers. The function does not directly affect the initial state variables `n`, `s`, or `a_i`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 998244353 for each i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 998244353 for each i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n**
