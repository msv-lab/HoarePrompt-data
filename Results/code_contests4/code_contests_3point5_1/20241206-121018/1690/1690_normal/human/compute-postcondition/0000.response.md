Example Answer:
The lambda function `rstr` is defined to read a line from input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 998244353 for each i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
