Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is incremented by the total number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by the total number of iterations of the loop, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j] == word[cur]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `cur` is 3, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`be` is incremented by the total number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by the total number of iterations of the loop, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` where `s[j] == word[cur]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `cur` is 3, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `n` is greater than 0**
