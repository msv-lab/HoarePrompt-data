According to the code, the loop will always execute 4 times as the range is fixed at 4. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0 at the start of each iteration for the loop to execute**
