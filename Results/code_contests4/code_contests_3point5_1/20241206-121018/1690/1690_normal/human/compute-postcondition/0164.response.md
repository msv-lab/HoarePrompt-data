According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is within the range from `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is decreased by 1, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are adjusted to be 1 less than their current values in the if part. If `cur` == `i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, otherwise, in the else part, `be`, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are adjusted to be 2 less than their current values. `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same after the execution of the if-else block. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next state should be:
State: **`be` is decreased by 1, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are adjusted to be 2 less than their current values, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same**
