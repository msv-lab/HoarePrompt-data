According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `be` and `en`. If the range `be` to `en` is valid (i.e., `be` is less than `en`), the loop can execute. Since `j` is the iterator variable, it should start at `be` and end at `en-1`. Before the loop starts, `cur` is 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `be` is less than `en`, `j` is equal to `be`, `cur` is 3, and `en` is decremented by 1. 
State: **Output State: `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by the total number of iterations of the loop, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 3, `j` is `be`, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`, `n` is greater than 0**
