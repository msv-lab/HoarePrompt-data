Postcondition: ***`be`, `j`, and `n` are integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `be` is incremented by 2, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, `be` is incremented by 2, `j` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the variables.***
