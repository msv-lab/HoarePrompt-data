According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute another time `j` must be less than `n+1`**
