According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is `n-2`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 1**
