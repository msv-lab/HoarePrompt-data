Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `j`, `n`, `cur` are integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is updated to `n`, `tem` is set to 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `j` is set to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is updated to `n`, `tem` is set to 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `j` is set to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `cur` is increased by 1.***
