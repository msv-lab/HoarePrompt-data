Output State: **`be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is set to 3, `j` is equal to `n-1`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `cur` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
