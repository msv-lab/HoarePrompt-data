Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `tem` will be the sum of values in `a` corresponding to the characters in `s` that match 'hard' within the range of `be` to `en`. All other variables remain the same as their initial values. `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.
