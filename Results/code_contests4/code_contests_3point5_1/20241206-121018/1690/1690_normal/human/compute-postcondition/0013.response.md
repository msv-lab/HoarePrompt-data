Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either equal to `i` or 1, `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the values of the variables remain unchanged and the loop breaks. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`.***
