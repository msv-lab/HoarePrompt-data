Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either equal to `i` or 1, `j` is 1. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.***
