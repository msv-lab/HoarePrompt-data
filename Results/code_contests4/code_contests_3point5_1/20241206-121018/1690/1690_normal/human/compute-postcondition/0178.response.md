According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. If `j` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j`, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same. If s[j] equals word[i], then tem is updated to n + a[j]. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` is incremented by 1, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same**
