Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j`, `n` are integers. If `cur == i`, the loop or if statement is broken. If `s[j] == word[cur]`, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by 1, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 1, `j` is -1, `n` is greater than 0. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values.***
