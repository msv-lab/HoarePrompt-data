At the end of the last iteration, all variables retain their initial values. Since the loop is going in reverse order, the next iteration will decrement `j` by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by 1, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 1, `j` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
