Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is incremented by 2, `j` is incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`be` is incremented by 2, `j` is incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`**
