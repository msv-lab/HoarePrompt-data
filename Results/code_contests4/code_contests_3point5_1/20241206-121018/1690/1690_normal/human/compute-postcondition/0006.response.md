According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `j` which will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications are needed:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
