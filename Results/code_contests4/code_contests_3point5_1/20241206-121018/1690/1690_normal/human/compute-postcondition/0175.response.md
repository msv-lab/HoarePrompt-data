According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. If `j` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is `n - 1 + a[j]`, `ans` is `n - 1`, `cur` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same. Since `j` is increased by 1 in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`. 
State: **`be` is `n - 2`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is `n - 1 + a[j]`, `ans` is `n - 1`, `cur` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same**
