Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is `n-2`, `cur` is either 3 or 2. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then the state remains unchanged.***
