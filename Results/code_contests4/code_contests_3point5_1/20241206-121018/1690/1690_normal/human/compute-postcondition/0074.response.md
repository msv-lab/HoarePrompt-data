Output State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is greater than 0, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`**
