According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `cur`, and `i`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is greater than 0, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and if `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s[j]` should be equal to `word[cur]`.

State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` is greater than 0, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, for the loop to execute `j` should be incremented by 1**
