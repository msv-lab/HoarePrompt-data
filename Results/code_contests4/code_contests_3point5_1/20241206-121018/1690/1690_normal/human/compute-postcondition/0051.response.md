According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `en` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `en` is greater than or equal to 1 and `be` is now equal to the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard'. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is either -1 or 0, for the loop to execute the first time `be` is the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard' and `en` is greater than or equal to 1**
