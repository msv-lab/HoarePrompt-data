Output State: **`be` is incremented by 1, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute another time `j` must be less than `n+1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
