According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. If `j` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `en`, which means the loop has already executed for the last time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `en`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard' plus 1, `en` is greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is increased by the value of `a[j]`, `cur` is either 3 or 2, `j` is adjusted to be less than `en` for the loop to execute one more time.
