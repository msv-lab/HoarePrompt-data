Example Answer: 
`en` is decreased by 1, but the previous value of `en` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `be` is decreased by 1, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are adjusted to be 1 less than their current values in the if part. If `cur` == `i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. In the else part, `be`, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are adjusted to be 2 less than their current values. `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same after the execution of the if-else block.
