According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `be` is 0 and `en` is `n` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 0. Additionally, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains the same, and `cur` is 0.
State: **`be` is 0, `en` is greater than 0, `tem` is 0, `ans` remains the same, `cur` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
