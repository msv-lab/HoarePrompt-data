According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states to ensure that the loop can execute. In this case, `n` should be at least 1 to execute the loop. Since the loop is iterating in reverse order from `n-1` to 0, we need to adjust `j` to be initialized as `n-1` before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that match 'hard', `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `j` is `n-1` for the loop to execute the first time**
