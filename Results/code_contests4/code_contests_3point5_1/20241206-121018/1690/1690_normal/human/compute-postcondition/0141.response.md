According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `be` needs to be incremented by another 1.
State: **`be` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute another time `j` is incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`**
