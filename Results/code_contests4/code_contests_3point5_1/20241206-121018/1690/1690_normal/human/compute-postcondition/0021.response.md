According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `s`, `a`, `ans`, `word`, `i`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, and `j`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `s`, `a`, `ans`, `word`, `i`, `be`, `en`, `tem`, `cur`, and `j` have specific values. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1
- If `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` should be incremented by 1

State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is initialized to positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `i` is 0, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either equal to `i` or incremented by 1 based on the conditions, `j` is incremented by 1**.
