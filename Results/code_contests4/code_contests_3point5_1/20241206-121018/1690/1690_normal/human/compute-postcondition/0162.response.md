Postcondition: ***`be`, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` is adjusted to be 1 less than its current value in the if part. If cur == i, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. In the else part, `be`, `en` is decreased by 1, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` is adjusted to be 2 less than its current value. `n`, `s`, `word` remain the same after the execution of the if-else block.***
