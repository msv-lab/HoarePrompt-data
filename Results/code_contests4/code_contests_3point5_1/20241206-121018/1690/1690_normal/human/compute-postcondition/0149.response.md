According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than 1, the loop can execute. The loop is iterating in reverse from `n - 1` down to 0. Before the loop starts, `be` is incremented by `n` indicates that `be` is greater than 0, `en` is `n` implies that `en` is greater than 0, and `tem` is 0 does not affect the loop execution. `ans` being updated to the minimum value also does not affect the loop execution. `cur` being equal to 3 does not affect the loop execution. `j` being `n - 1` indicates that `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `n` must be greater than 1, `be` is greater than 0, `en` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and `cur` is 3.
State: **`be` is greater than 0, `en` is greater than 0, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `cur` is 3, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
