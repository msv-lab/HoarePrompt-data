Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, the program state will be as follows: `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by the total number of iterations of the loop, `tem` is increased by the value of `a[j]`, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 3, `j` is `be`, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[i`]`.***
