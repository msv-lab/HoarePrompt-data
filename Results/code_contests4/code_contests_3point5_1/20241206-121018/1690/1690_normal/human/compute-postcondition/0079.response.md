Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur`, `j` are all integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then `be` is incremented by 1, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is either incremented by 1 or set to `i`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `be` is incremented by 1, `en` remains greater than 0, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is either incremented by 2 or set to `i`, and for the loop to execute `j` should be incremented by 1.***
