According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the initial value of `j` is `en - 1`, where `en` is `n`, so `j` is equal to `n - 1`. To ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted to `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `cur` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `cur` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
