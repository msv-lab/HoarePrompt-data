According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop is moving in reverse order and decrementing `j` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be -1.
State: **`be`, `en`, `tem`, `ans`, `cur` are integers, `be` is incremented by the number of times the condition `s[j] == word[cur]` is met, `en` is decremented by 1, `tem` remains 0, `ans` stays the same, `cur` is 2, `j` is -1, `n` is greater than 0**
