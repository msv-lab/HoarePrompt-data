Functionality: The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `s`, and `a`, initializes `ans` to infinity, and `word` to 'hard'. It then iterates through different configurations of the word 'hard' within the string `s` to calculate the minimum sum of values in `a` corresponding to the characters that match 'hard'. Finally, it prints the minimum sum found. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it misses handling the case where the characters of 'hard' are not found in the string `s`.
