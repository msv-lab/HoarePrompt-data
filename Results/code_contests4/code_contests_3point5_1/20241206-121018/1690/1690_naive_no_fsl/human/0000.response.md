Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible ambiguity of the statement after Vasya deletes some characters so that the resulting statement is easy. The program iterates through the string to find the positions where the word "hard" can be formed as a subsequence. It then calculates the ambiguity at those positions based on the given values and keeps track of the minimum ambiguity found so far. Finally, it outputs the minimum ambiguity.

The program handles all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description for all inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
