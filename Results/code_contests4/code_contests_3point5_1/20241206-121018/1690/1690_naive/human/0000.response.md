Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through different ways of removing characters to make the statement easy, calculates the ambiguity at each step, and keeps track of the minimum ambiguity. It follows the problem description by considering all possible cases of removing characters to make the statement easy. The logic seems sound and there are no apparent cases where the program would not work as expected.
