Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. Here are the issues:
1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. The correct function to use for input in Python 3 is `input()`.
2. The program tries to convert the input strings directly to integers without splitting them first. This will result in a ValueError.
3. The program uses the `range()` function incorrectly in the for loop. It should be `range(len(testSNs))`.
4. The program checks if the last digit of the input numbers is not 0, which is not the requirement of the problem description. The program should check if the sum of A and B is 10 or greater, not individual digits.
5. The program does not handle the case where the sum of A and B is 10 or greater and should output "error" as per the problem description.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
