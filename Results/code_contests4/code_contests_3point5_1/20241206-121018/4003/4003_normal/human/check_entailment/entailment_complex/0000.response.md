Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly solve the given problem description. 

1. The program does not take two integers A and B as input. Instead, it reads a list of strings from the user.
2. The program then tries to iterate over the range of strings in the list, which will result in a TypeError as you cannot iterate over strings in a range.
3. The comparison in the if statement uses `is` instead of `==`, which is incorrect for comparing values.
4. The program calculates the `SCORE` based on the sum of elements where the last digit is not 0, which is not the intended behavior as per the problem description.

Overall, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description requirements.
