Example Answer:
The keyword `continue` in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and jump to the next iteration. Since there is no loop mentioned in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list of strings, SCORE is an integer, for the loop to execute one more time x is incremented by 1**
