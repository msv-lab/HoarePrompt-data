Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but it skips the rest of the code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list of strings, SCORE is an integer, x is less than testSNs[0] and we continue with the next iteration.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list of strings, SCORE is an integer, x is less than testSNs[0] and we continue with the next iteration**
