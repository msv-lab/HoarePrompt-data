Example Answer:
`testSNs` is assigned the split input values. Since the input is not specified, the exact values of A and B cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings**
