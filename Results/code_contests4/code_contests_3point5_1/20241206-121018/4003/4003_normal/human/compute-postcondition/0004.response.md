Example Answer:
`SCORE` is incremented by the value of `testSNs[x]`. The value of `testSNs[x]` is added to `SCORE`. The element at index x in `testSNs` is not divisible by 10. The output state is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer with an incremented value based on `testSNs[x]`, for the loop to execute `testSNs[0]` is greater than or equal to 1. The element at index x in `testSNs` is not divisible by 10.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list of strings, `SCORE` is an integer with an incremented value based on `testSNs[x]`, for the loop to execute `testSNs[0]` is greater than or equal to 1. The element at index x in `testSNs` is not divisible by 10.**
