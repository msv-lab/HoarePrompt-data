Postcondition: ***A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list of strings, SCORE is an integer. If the last digit of testSNs[x] is not 0, SCORE is incremented by the value of testSNs[x] and x is incremented by 1. Otherwise, x is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.***
