Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because:
1. The program is using `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. The correct function to use for input in Python 3 is `input()`.
2. The program is trying to split the input and convert it to integers by using `int(0)` which is not correct. It should be `int(testSNs[0])`.
3. The program is trying to iterate over the range of `testSNs[0]` which is not the correct way to iterate over the input integers.
4. The condition `if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0` is incorrect. It should be checking if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to 10.

Overall, the program does not follow the problem description and has logical errors in the implementation.
