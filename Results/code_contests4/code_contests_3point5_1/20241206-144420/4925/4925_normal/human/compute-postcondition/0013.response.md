Example Answer:
`p[vc]` is assigned the value of `v`, and `vc` is assigned the value of `p[vc]`. Since `vc` is not equal to the new root node that `v` is pointing to, the values of `p` and `v` are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `vc` is now equal to the new root node that `v` is pointing to, and `p` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`vc` is now equal to the new root node that `v` is pointing to, `p` is updated accordingly**
