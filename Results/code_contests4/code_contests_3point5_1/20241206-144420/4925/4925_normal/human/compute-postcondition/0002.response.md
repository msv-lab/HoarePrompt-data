The function `func_11` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, both of which are integers. The constraints for these parameters are such that 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5). After executing the function body, the function returns the value of (x + r - 1) divided by r. If the result of this division is not an integer, the function returns the ceiling value of x divided by r. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_11` is to accept two integers `x` and `r` within the specified constraints, and return the result of the division of (x + r - 1) by r. If the result is not an integer, it returns the ceiling value of x divided by r. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers x and r within specified constraints and returns the result of (x + r - 1) divided by r, handling non-integer results by returning the ceiling value of x divided by r.**
