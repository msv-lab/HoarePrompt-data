Example Answer:
`roots` is updated by adding the result of calling `find(i)`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The previous values of `v`, `roots`, `p`, `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, `roots` contains the result of calling find(i) added to it, `p` is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`v` is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, `roots` contains the result of calling find(i) added to it, `p` is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is increased by 1**
