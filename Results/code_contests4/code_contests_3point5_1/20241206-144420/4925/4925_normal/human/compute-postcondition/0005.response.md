Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped, and `x` is assigned the value of `x % y`. The new values of `x` and `y` depend on the initial values of `x` and `y`. After the execution, the Output State will be the new values of `x` and `y` based on the initial conditions.
Output State: **new values of `x` and `y` based on the initial conditions**
