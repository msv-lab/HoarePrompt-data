Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ n, `a_i` ≠ `b_i`. The values of `u` and `v` are not equal. If `r[u]` < `r[v]`, then the values of `u` and `v` are swapped. `p[u]` is assigned the value `v`. After the execution of the if else block, if `r[u]` is equal to `r[v]`, then `r[u]` is incremented by 1.***
