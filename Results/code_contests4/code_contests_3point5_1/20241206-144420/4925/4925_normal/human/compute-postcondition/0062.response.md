Output State: **n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i; v is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the sets in sg will be merged and updated according to the union(i, j) function. All elements will be present in sg as per the function's logic. All other variables will remain unchanged.**
