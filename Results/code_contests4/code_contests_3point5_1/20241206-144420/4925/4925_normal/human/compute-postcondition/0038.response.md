Example Answer:
The union function merges the sets at indices i and j in sg. As j is not in sg[i], the set at index i in sg will be updated to include both previous elements and the element j. The variable v will be updated to the index with the minimum length of the sets in sg. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i, and v is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, for the loop to execute the next time i is 1, j is 1. Additionally, j is not in sg[i], and the union of sets at indices i and j has been performed.
