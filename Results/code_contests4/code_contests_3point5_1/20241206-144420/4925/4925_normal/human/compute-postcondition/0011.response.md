The function `union` accepts two parameters `u` and `v`, both of which are integers. The constraints for the integers are as follows: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). Additionally, for each pair of integers (a_i, b_i) such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i. The function returns `u`, which is equal to `v`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `union` is to accept two integers `u` and `v` and return `u` as the output.
