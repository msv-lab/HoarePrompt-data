Postcondition: ***n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i, and v is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, for the loop to execute the next time i is 1 and i is in sg[v], j is 0. Additionally, j is not in sg[i]***
