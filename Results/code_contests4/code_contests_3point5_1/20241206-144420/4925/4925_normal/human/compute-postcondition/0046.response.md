Output State: **n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i; v is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg. The loop iterates through all values of j from 0 to n-1 and if j is not in sg[i], the union of sets at indices i and j has been performed.**
