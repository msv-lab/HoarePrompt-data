Example Answer:
The code calculates the ceiling value of x divided by r and assigns it to an empty string. The values of x and r are integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state is: x and r are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5); empty string is assigned the ceiling value of x divided by r.
Output State: **x and r are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5); empty string is assigned the ceiling value of x divided by r**
