The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. The constraints are that `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^5 and `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= min((x(x-1))/2, 10^5). After executing the function body, the program returns the final value of `x` after the loop finishes. Additionally, `y` becomes 0 after the loop. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `x` and `y` within the specified constraints and return the final value of `x` after the loop finishes, with `y` becoming 0. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers x and y, where x is between 1 and 10^5 and y is between 0 and min((x(x-1))/2, 10^5). It returns the final value of x after the loop finishes, with y becoming 0.**
