Postcondition: ***n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i, and v is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0. If i is not in sg[v], the program executes the loop logic. After all iterations have finished, the sets in sg will be merged according to the union(i, j) function, ensuring all elements are present as per the function's logic. All variables, other than the sets in sg, will remain unchanged.***
