According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `y` remains truthy. At the end of the last iteration, `x` and `y` have new values based on the initial conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to remain truthy. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` and `y` have new values based on the initial conditions, for the loop to execute again `y` needs to remain truthy**
