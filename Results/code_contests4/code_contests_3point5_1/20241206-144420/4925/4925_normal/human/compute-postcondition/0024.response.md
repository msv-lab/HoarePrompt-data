Example Answer: 
The `union(i, j)` function will merge the sets at indices `i` and `j` in `sg`. This will update the sets in `sg` accordingly. The values of `n`, `m`, `p`, `v`, and the conditions for `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: *n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i, and `v` is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0. Additionally, i is in sg[v]. Moreover, j is not in sg[i].
