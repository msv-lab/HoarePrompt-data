Functionality: **The function func_11 accepts two integers x and r within the specified constraints of 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5). It calculates the ceiling value of the division of (x + r - 1) by r and returns the result. The function accurately handles cases where the division does not result in an integer by returning the ceiling value.**
