According to the code, the loop will execute n times based on the range(n) statement. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i, and `v` is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0**
