Example Answer:
The function `union(i, j)` merges the sets at indices `i` and `j` in `sg`. The sets at indices `i` and `j` are modified accordingly. The value of `v` might change based on the new set lengths in `sg`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5); p is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1; sg is a list of sets where sg[i] contains all elements that have been added to sg at index i; v is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg; j is in the range from 0 to n-1.
