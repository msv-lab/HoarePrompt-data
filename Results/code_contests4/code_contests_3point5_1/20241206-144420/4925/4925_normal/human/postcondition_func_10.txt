The function func_9 accepts a list of tuples 'l' representing edges in a graph, along with start and end vertices. It returns a range starting from the 'start' vertex to the length of list 'l' plus the 'end' vertex. This range represents the vertices of the graph. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotation and the code. The code actually returns a range starting from 'start' to the length of list 'l' plus 'end', which may not accurately represent the vertices of the graph as described in the annotation. It is also unclear how the list of tuples 'l' is utilized in determining the range of vertices.
