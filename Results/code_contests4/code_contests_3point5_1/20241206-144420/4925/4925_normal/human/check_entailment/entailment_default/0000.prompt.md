You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Examples

Input

Input


3 0


Output


0

Note

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    (n, m) = func_4()
    p = list(range(n))
    r = func_7(int, n)


    sg = func_7(set, n)

    roots = set()
    for i in range(n):
        roots.add(find(i))
    print(len(roots) - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function `func_1` initializes variables based on the output of other functions and processes them to find the set with the minimum length, then merges sets based on certain conditions. It calculates the number of unique roots found and outputs the count minus one. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find(v):
    vc = v
    while v != p[v]:
        v = p[v]
    while vc != v:
        (p[vc], vc) = (v, p[vc])
    return v
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function `find` accepts a parameter `v` that represents a node in a graph. It iteratively finds and updates `v` to point to the root node it belongs to, and returns the root node. The variable `p` is also updated during the process. However, there is a missing edge case where the function does not handle the scenario when `v` is not a valid node index.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def union(u, v):
    (u, v) = (find(u), find(v))
    if u == v:
        return
    if r[u] < r[v]:
        (u, v) = (v, u)
    p[u] = v
    if r[u] == r[v]:
        r[u] += 1
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function `union` accepts two integer parameters `u` and `v`. It checks if `u` is equal to `v` and returns `u`. If `u` is not equal to `v`, it swaps the values of `u` and `v` based on the conditions specified. The functionality of the function is to perform the union operation on the input integers `u` and `v`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x):
    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts a parameter x and calculates the result of raising 'x' to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD, returning the result.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function func_3 accepts two integers x and y, where x is between 1 and 10^5, and y is between 0 and min((x(x-1))/2, 10^5). It then performs a loop to update the values of x and y until y becomes 0. Finally, it returns the final value of x after the loop finishes.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer. The program assumes the input consists of space-separated integers. It does not consider any error handling or validation of the input data.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(o):
    return list(map(lambda x: int(x) + o, input().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a parameter `o`, converts each element in the input string to an integer, adds `o` to each integer, and returns a list of these modified integers. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to input validation or unexpected input types.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n, m):
    return [func_4() for _ in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function func_6 accepts two non-negative integers n and m, and then returns a list of length 'n' where each element is the result of calling the function func_4(). The values of 'n' and 'm' are constrained to be non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(f, *dim):
    return [func_7(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function func_7 accepts a parameter `f` and returns a list of values generated by calling func_7 with arguments `f` and the remaining dimensions of `dim` for each element in the range of `dim[0]`. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f`. The function is intended to handle recursion with the given parameters, but there is a missing implementation for the variable `dim` which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function func_8 accepts three parameters: start, step, and count, where start is the starting point of the range, step is the step size between elements, and count is the total number of elements in the range. The function then returns a range starting from start with the specified step size and containing the specified count of elements.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(l, start=0, end=0):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function func_9 accepts a list of tuples 'l' representing edges in a graph, along with start and end vertices. It returns a range starting from the 'start' vertex to the length of list 'l' plus the 'end' vertex. This range represents the vertices of the graph. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotation and the code. The code actually returns a range starting from 'start' to the length of list 'l' plus 'end', which may not accurately represent the vertices of the graph as described in the annotation. It is also unclear how the list of tuples 'l' is utilized in determining the range of vertices.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(n):
    """ [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ...] """
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function func_10 accepts a parameter n and returns the value of 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is the length of the list [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ...] minus 1.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(x, r):

''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function func_11 accepts two integers x and r within the specified constraints of 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5). It calculates the ceiling value of the division of (x + r - 1) by r and returns the result. The function accurately handles cases where the division does not result in an integer by returning the ceiling value.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
