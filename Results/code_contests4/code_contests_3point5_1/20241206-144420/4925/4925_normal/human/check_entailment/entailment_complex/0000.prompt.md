You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.

It is an undirected weighted graph on n vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either 0 or 1; exactly m edges have weight 1, and all others have weight 0.

Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5)), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight 1 in the graph. 

The i-th of the next m lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), the endpoints of the i-th edge of weight 1.

It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.

Output

Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight 0, other edges have weight 1. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight 2.

In the second sample, all edges have weight 0 so any spanning tree has total weight 0.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the sets in sg will be merged and updated according to the union(i, j) function. All elements will be present in sg as per the function's logic. All other variables will remain unchanged.
    roots = set()
    for i in range(n):
        roots.add(find(i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v` is the index with the minimum length of the set in sg, `roots` contains the result of calling find(i) for all i in the range of n, `p` is a list containing integers from 0 to n-1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1
    print(len(roots) - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` initializes variables based on the output of other functions and processes them to find the set with the minimum length, then merges sets based on certain conditions. It calculates the number of unique roots found and outputs the count minus one. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and no edge appears twice in the input.**
def find(v):
    vc = v
    while v != p[v]:
        v = p[v]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `vc` is assigned the value of the root node that `v` belongs to after all iterations have executed, `v` is updated to the root node of the current node it is pointing to
    while vc != v:
        p[vc], vc = v, p[vc]
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `vc` is now equal to the root node that `v` is pointing to after all iterations have executed, `v` is updated to the root node of the current node it is pointing to, `p` is updated accordingly
    return v
    #The program returns the root node that variable `v` is pointing to after all iterations have executed. Variable `v` is updated to the root node of the current node it is pointing to, and variable `p` is updated accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find` accepts a parameter `v` that represents a node in a graph. It iteratively finds and updates `v` to point to the root node it belongs to, and returns the root node. The variable `p` is also updated during the process. However, there is a missing edge case where the function does not handle the scenario when `v` is not a valid node index.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i.**
def union(u, v):
    u, v = find(u), find(v)
    if (u == v) :
        return
        #The program returns u which is equal to v
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i. The values of u and v are not equal.
    if (r[u] < r[v]) :
        u, v = v, u
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i. The values of u and v are not equal. If r[u] < r[v], then the values of u and v are swapped.
    p[u] = v
    if (r[u] == r[v]) :
        r[u] += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ n, `a_i` ≠ `b_i`. The values of `u` and `v` are not equal. If `r[u]` < `r[v]`, then the values of `u` and `v` are swapped. `p[u]` is assigned the value `v`. After the execution of the if else block, if `r[u]` is equal to `r[v]`, then `r[u]` is incremented by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `union` accepts two integer parameters `u` and `v`. It checks if `u` is equal to `v` and returns `u`. If `u` is not equal to `v`, it swaps the values of `u` and `v` based on the conditions specified. The functionality of the function is to perform the union operation on the input integers `u` and `v`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(x):
    return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)
    #The program returns the result of raising 'x' to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter x and calculates the result of raising 'x' to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD, returning the result.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= y <= min((x(x-1))/2, 10^5).**
def func_3(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y

    return x
    #The program returns the final value of 'x' after the loop finishes. 'y' becomes 0 after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts two integers x and y, where x is between 1 and 10^5, and y is between 0 and min((x(x-1))/2, 10^5). It then performs a loop to update the values of x and y until y becomes 0. Finally, it returns the final value of x after the loop finishes.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).**
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer. The program assumes the input consists of space-separated integers. It does not consider any error handling or validation of the input data.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(o):
    return list(map(lambda x: int(x) + o, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by adding 0 to each element after converting it to an integer from the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `o`, converts each element in the input string to an integer, adds `o` to each integer, and returns a list of these modified integers. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to input validation or unexpected input types.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).**
def func_6(n, m):
    return [func_4() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of length 'n', where each element is the result of calling the function func_4(). The values of 'n' and 'm' are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_6 accepts two non-negative integers n and m, and then returns a list of length 'n' where each element is the result of calling the function func_4(). The values of 'n' and 'm' are constrained to be non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5).

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). The input edges are distinct pairs of integers a_i and b_i where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n and a_i ≠ b_i.**
def func_7(f):
    return [func_7(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values generated by calling func_7 with arguments f and the remaining dimensions of dim for each element in the range of dim[0], or the result of calling f if dim is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts a parameter `f` and returns a list of values generated by calling func_7 with arguments `f` and the remaining dimensions of `dim` for each element in the range of `dim[0]`. If `dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f`. The function is intended to handle recursion with the given parameters, but there is a missing implementation for the variable `dim` which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and a_i ≠ b_i.**
def func_8(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' with a step size of 'step' and containing 'count' elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts three parameters: start, step, and count, where start is the starting point of the range, step is the step size between elements, and count is the total number of elements in the range. The function then returns a range starting from start with the specified step size and containing the specified count of elements.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the endpoints of an edge in the graph. start and end are integers representing the start and end vertices of the graph. 1 <= start, end <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.**
def func_9(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'. The range represents the vertices of the graph.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_9 accepts a list of tuples 'l' representing edges in a graph, along with start and end vertices. It returns a range starting from the 'start' vertex to the length of list 'l' plus the 'end' vertex. This range represents the vertices of the graph. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotation and the code. The code actually returns a range starting from 'start' to the length of list 'l' plus 'end', which may not accurately represent the vertices of the graph as described in the annotation. It is also unclear how the list of tuples 'l' is utilized in determining the range of vertices.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_10(n):
    """ [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ...] """
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the value of 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is the length of the list [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ...] minus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_10 accepts a parameter n and returns the value of 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is the length of the list [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ...] minus 1.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and r are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5).**
def func_11(x, r):
    """ = ceil(x / r) """
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the value of (x + r - 1) divided by r, where x and r are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5). If the empty string is assigned, it is the ceiling value of x divided by r.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_11 accepts two integers x and r within the specified constraints of 1 <= x <= 10^5 and 0 <= r <= min((x(x-1))/2,10^5). It calculates the ceiling value of the division of (x + r - 1) by r and returns the result. The function accurately handles cases where the division does not result in an integer by returning the ceiling value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
