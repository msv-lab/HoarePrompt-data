Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph as described in the problem statement. It constructs the graph based on the input edges and then finds the minimum spanning tree weight by performing union-find operations. The algorithm follows the logic of finding the root nodes of the vertices and merging them accordingly to form a minimum spanning tree.

The functions `find` and `union` are correctly implemented to find the root nodes and merge the disjoint sets. The program efficiently handles the input data and produces the correct output for all possible cases, ensuring that the minimum spanning tree weight is calculated accurately.
