Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the corresponding annotations, it appears that the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The functions defined in the program seem to correctly implement the required logic for finding the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. The annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function and their relevance to the problem description. Additionally, the program structure and variable usage seem appropriate for solving the given graph theory problem. Since no discrepancies or missing logic were found after carefully examining the code, annotations, and problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
