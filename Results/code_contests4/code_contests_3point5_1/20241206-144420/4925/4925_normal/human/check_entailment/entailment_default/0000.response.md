Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph, but the implementation of the functions `find` and `union` are incomplete and do not handle all possible scenarios. The `find` function does not consider the case when the input node index `v` is invalid, and the `union` function does not account for all possible conditions in the merge operation.

Additionally, the output hints for function 2 mention that there is a missing edge case in the `find` function where it does not handle invalid node indices, which indicates a potential issue with the code.

Therefore, based on the incomplete implementation of the functions and the potential edge cases identified in the output hints, the correctness of the code is deemed to be false.
