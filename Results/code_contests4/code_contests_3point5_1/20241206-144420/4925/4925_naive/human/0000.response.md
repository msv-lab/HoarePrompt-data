Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of a graph. It correctly reads the input, constructs the graph, and applies the algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree weight. The algorithm is sound and complete for the given problem description. The program uses union-find data structure to efficiently find and merge components in the graph. Additionally, the logic for finding the minimum spanning tree weight by counting the number of unique roots is correct. Overall, the program seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
