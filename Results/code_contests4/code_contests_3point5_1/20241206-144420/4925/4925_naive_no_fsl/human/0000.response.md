Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the given graph. It implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree by considering the edges with weight 1 first and then adding the remaining edges with weight 0. The program correctly handles the input format as described in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples.

The program constructs the graph using a disjoint set data structure and union-find operations to find the minimum spanning tree efficiently. It iterates over the edges with weight 1 first and then connects the vertices using the union operation. Finally, it counts the number of unique roots in the disjoint set structure to determine the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
