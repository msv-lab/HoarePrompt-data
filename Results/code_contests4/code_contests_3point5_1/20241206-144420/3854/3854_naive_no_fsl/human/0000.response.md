Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly simulates the processor based on the given instructions for each core within the specified number of cycles. It handles the cases where multiple cores try to write information to the same memory cell, resulting in a deadlock situation. The program correctly identifies when a core will be locked and prints the cycle number accordingly. The code also initializes the required data structures and processes the input instructions in a loop. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for the provided examples.
