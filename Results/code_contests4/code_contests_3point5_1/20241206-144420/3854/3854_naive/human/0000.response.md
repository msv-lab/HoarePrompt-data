Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the input as described in the problem statement and simulates the processor for the given set of instructions for each core within m cycles. It correctly handles the cases where multiple cores try to write to the same memory cell and ensures that the cores are locked in case of conflicts. The output of the program also matches the expected output as described in the problem statement for all the given examples. The program logic seems to be correct and in line with the problem description.
