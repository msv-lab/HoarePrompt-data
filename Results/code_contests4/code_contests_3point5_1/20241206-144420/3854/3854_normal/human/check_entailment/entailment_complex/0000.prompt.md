You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The research center Q has developed a new multi-core processor. The processor consists of n cores and has k cells of cache memory. Consider the work of this processor.

At each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction: either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will write an information to the cell). After receiving the command, the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case there is a deadlock: all these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever. Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core in the future will be able to record an information into the locked cell. If any of the cores tries to write an information into some locked cell, it is immediately locked.

The development team wants to explore the deadlock situation. Therefore, they need a program that will simulate the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within m cycles . You're lucky, this interesting work is entrusted to you. According to the instructions, during the m cycles define for each core the number of the cycle, during which it will become locked. It is believed that initially all cores and all memory cells are not locked.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100). Then follow n lines describing instructions. The i-th line contains m integers: xi1, xi2, ..., xim (0 ≤ xij ≤ k), where xij is the instruction that must be executed by the i-th core at the j-th cycle. If xij equals 0, then the corresponding instruction is «do nothing». But if xij is a number from 1 to k, then the corresponding instruction is «write information to the memory cell number xij».

We assume that the cores are numbered from 1 to n, the work cycles are numbered from 1 to m and the memory cells are numbered from 1 to k.

Output

Print n lines. In the i-th line print integer ti. This number should be equal to 0 if the i-th core won't be locked, or it should be equal to the number of the cycle when this core will be locked.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    n, m, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ins = [([0] * m) for i in xrange(n + 1)]
    cell = [False] * (k + 1)
    nn = [0] * (k + 1)
    core = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in xrange(n):
        ins[i + 1] = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` are determined by the input values, and `ins` contains the mapped integers from the input split by spaces for each index from 1 to n
    for i in xrange(m):
        for j in xrange(1, k + 1):
            nn[j] = 0
        
        for j in xrange(1, n + 1):
            if core[j] == 0:
                d = ins[j][i]
                if d != 0:
                    if cell[d]:
                        core[j] = i + 1
                    elif nn[d] != 0:
                        cell[d] = True
                        core[j] = core[nn[d]] = i + 1
                        nn[d] = j
                    elif nn[d] == 0:
                        nn[d] = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j`, and `d` will have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. The final state will depend on the input values and the logic within the loop. The values of `nn[j]`, `core[j]`, `d`, `cell[d]`, `j`, `n`, and `k` will be determined by the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop.
    for i in xrange(1, n + 1):
        print(core[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All `core` values from `core[1]` to `core[n]` will be printed in sequence. The values of `i` will go from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the input value. The values of `nn[j]`, `d`, `cell[d]`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, then populates the lists `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` accordingly. It processes these lists through nested loops, updating the values based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the values of `core` from `core[1]` to `core[n]` sequentially. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
