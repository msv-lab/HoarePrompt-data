Correctness: **True**

The program correctly simulates the processor as described in the problem description. It iterates through each cycle and each core, determining whether a core will be locked based on the instructions given. It appropriately handles cases where multiple cores try to write to the same memory cell, resulting in deadlock.

The program follows the problem description by correctly identifying the cycle at which each core will become locked or remain unlocked based on the given instructions. It ensures that if a core tries to write to a locked memory cell, it becomes locked as well. Overall, the program accurately simulates the behavior of the multi-core processor as described in the problem.
