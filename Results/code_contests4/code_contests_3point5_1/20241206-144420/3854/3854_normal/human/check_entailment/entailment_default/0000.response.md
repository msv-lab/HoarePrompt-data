Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly simulate the processor as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the logic of handling conflicting memory cell writes. The code does not properly resolve conflicts when multiple cores try to write to the same memory cell in the same cycle. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2 2
1 2
1 2
2 2
```
The output should be:
```
1
1
0
```
But the code will produce incorrect output as it does not handle the conflict resolution properly.
