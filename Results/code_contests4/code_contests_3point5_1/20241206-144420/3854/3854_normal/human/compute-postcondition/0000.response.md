Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values by mapping them to integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided.
Output State: **values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided**
