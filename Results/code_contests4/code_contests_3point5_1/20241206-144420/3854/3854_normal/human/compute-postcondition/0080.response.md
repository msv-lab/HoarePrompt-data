Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is 1. `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute. `core[j]` is equal to 0. `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. `d` is not equal to 0. The condition (cell[d]) is true now. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the value of `d` is not equal to 0, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0.**
