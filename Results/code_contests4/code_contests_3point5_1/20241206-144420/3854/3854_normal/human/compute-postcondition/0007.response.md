According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the previous iteration. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` are determined by the input values, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the previous iteration**
