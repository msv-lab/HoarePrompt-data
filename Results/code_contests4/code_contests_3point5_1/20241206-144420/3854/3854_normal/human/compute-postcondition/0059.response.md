Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `d`, `j` are determined by the input values. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are assigned the value `i + 1`, `nn[d]` takes the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is 0, `nn[d]` is updated based on the current value of `j`.***
