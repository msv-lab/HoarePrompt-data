Postcondition: ***All `nn[j]`, `core[j]`, `d`, `cell[d]`, `j`, `n`, and `k` are updated based on the conditions. If `d` is not equal to 0, the program updates the variables according to the specified conditions. If `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`, otherwise `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are assigned the value of `i + 1`. In both cases, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is updated based on the conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is increased by 1, `n` is updated based on the conditions, and `k` remains the same. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, the program executes the specified updates on the variables as described in the if part. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, the program executes the specified updates on the variables as described in the else part.***
