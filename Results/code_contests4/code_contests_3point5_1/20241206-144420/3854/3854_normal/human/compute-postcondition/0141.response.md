Postcondition: ***All `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`], `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `d` is not equal to 0, then based on the evaluation of `cell[d]`, the following changes occur: if `cell[d]` is true, `core[j]` is set to `i + 1`, `d` is assigned `ins[j][i]`, and `d` is not equal to 0. If `cell[d]` is false, `nn[d]` is set to `j`, `core[j]` remains 0, `core[nn[d]]` is set to `i + 1`, `d` is assigned `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, and `nn[d]` is set to `j`. After the if condition, `nn[d]` is equal to `j` if the if condition is true.***
