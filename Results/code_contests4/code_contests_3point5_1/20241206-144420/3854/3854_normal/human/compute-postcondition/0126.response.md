Example Answer:
The value of `d` is assigned `ins[j][i]`. The values of `nn[j]`, `n`, `k`, and `core[j]` remain unchanged. The values of `j` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `d`. Therefore, the Output State is: All `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`], `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1. Additionally, `core[j]` is equal to 0, and `d` is assigned `ins[j][i]`.
