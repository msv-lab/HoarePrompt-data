Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, all variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1. The value of `d` is updated based on the incremented `i` and `j`. If `core[j]` is equal to 0 and `d` is not equal to 0, the following conditions apply: if `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is set to `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is set to True, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
