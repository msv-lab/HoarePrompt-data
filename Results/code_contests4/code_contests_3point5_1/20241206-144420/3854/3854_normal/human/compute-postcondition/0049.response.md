Postcondition: ***`d` is determined by the input values. `core[j]`, `core[nn[d]]`, `cell[i+2]`, and `cell[nn[d]+2]` are all integers. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are updated to `i + 2`, and the corresponding indices in the `cell` list are set to `True`. If `nn[d] != 0`, then `nn[d]` is updated with the value of `j`. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
