Example Answer:
`nn[j]` is assigned the value 0. All `nn[j]` are already 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`]. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i` (incremented by 1), `j` is 1, `d` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, all `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i` (incremented by 1), `j` is 1, `d` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, all `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute the first time**
