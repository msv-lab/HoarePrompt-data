Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j`, `d` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is 1. All `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`]. All `core[j]` are equal to 0. `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not equal to 0, then based on the condition `(cell[d])`, `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`. If `(cell[d])` is false and `nn[d] == 0` after the execution of the if else block, then `nn[d]` is updated to `j`. After entering the if condition, `d` is not equal to 0 and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0. `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1`.***
