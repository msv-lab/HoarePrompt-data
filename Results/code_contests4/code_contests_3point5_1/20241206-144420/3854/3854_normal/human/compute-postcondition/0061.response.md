Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `d`, `j` are determined by the input values. If `d != 0` and `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`. If `d != 0` and `cell[d]` is False, then depending on the value of `nn[d]`, `j` is either incremented by 1 and certain values are updated, or `nn[d]` is updated based on the current value of `j`. If `d == 0`, there is no change to the state of the program.***
