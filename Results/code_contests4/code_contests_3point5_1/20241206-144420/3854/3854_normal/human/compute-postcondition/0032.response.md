Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core` are determined by the input values. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is k, `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0 for all j in the range [1, k]. Additionally, when `core[j]` equals 0, the program variables are in this state. `d` is determined by the value of `ins[k][0]`. Moreover, when the value of `d` is not equal to 0 and cell[d] is false, the program variables maintain their initial values and relationships. Additionally, `nn[d]` is equal to 0. After entering the if condition, `nn[d]` is equal to 0***
