According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, all `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`]. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 and the value of `j` is 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i` (incremented by 1), `j` is 1, `d` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, all `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute the first time**
