Postcondition: ***All `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`], `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1. `core[j]` is equal to 0, `d` is assigned `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is false, and `nn[d]` is equal to `j` where `d` is the value assigned to `ins[j][i]`. Additionally, `nn[d]` is equal to `j` after the if condition is true.***
