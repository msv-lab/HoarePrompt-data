Postcondition: ***`d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, where `ins[j][i]` accesses the value at index `i` of the list at index `j`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is `i + 1`, `core[nn[d]]` is `i + 1`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[ins[j][i]]` is assigned the value `j`.***
