Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `d` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `i` is now incremented by 1. `j` is 1. All `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`]. All `core[j]` are equal to 0. `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. `d` is not equal to 0. The condition (cell[d]) is false. Additionally, `nn[d]` is equal to 0. The condition (nn[d] == 0) is true. `nn[d]` is now assigned the value of `j`.**
