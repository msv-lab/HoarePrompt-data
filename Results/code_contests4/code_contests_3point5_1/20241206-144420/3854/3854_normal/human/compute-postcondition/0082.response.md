Output State: `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `i`, `j`, `d` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is 1. `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute. `core[j]` is equal to 0. `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. `d` is not equal to 0. The condition (cell[d]) is true. After entering the if condition, the value of `d` is not equal to 0 and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0. `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1`. `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.
