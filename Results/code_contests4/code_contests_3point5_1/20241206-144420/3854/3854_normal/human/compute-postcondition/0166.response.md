Postcondition: ***All `nn[j]`, `core[j]`, `d`, `cell[d]`, `j`, `n`, and `k` are updated based on the conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is increased by 1, `n` is updated based on the conditions. If `core[j]` is equal to 0, then `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not equal to 0, the program state changes as follows: if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is `i + 1`, `core[nn[d]]` is `i + 1`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, `nn[ins[j][i]]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `d` is equal to 0, no changes occur in the program state.***
