Example Answer:
`core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The values of `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `core[j]` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: the value of `d` is determined by the input values, `core[j]` is dependent on the values of `i` and `j`.
Output State: **the value of `d` is determined by the input values, `core[j]` is dependent on the values of `i` and `j**.
