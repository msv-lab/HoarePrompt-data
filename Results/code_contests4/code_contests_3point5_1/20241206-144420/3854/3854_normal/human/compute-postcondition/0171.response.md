According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `core[i]` is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration within the range of 1 to `n+1`.
State: **The value of `core[i+1]` will be printed, where `i` is the next value within the range of 1 to `n+1`**
