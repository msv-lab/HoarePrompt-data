Example Answer:
`nn` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of k + 1. Since the initial state values of `k` are determined by the input provided, `nn` will be a list of zeros with a length determined by the input. The other variables and the 2D list `ins` and `cell` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided; a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s; `cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with length k + 1; `nn` is a list of zeros with a length determined by the input.
Output State: **values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided; a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s; `cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with length k + 1; `nn` is a list of zeros with a length determined by the input**.
