Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core` are determined by the input values. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `k`, `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0 for all `j` in the range [1, `k`]. Additionally, when `core[j]` equals 0, the program variables are in this state. `d` is determined by the value of `ins[k][0]`. When the value of `d` is not equal to 0, the program variables maintain their initial values and relationships. If `cell[d]` is true, `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `cell[d]` is false and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, after the execution `cell[d]` is set to True. `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1`. `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, `nn[d]` is assigned the current value of `j`.***
