Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `d` are determined by the input values, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is incremented by 1 and the conditions related to `nn[j]`, `core[j]`, `cell[d]`, and `d` are updated. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is updated based on the current value of `j`.***
