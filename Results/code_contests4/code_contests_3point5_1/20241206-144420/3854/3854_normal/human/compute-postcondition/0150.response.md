Postcondition: ***All `nn[j]` are updated based on the conditions, `core[j]` is updated based on the conditions, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is updated based on the conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is increased by 1, `n` is updated based on the conditions, `k` remains the same. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then the program executes the specified updates on the variables as described.***
