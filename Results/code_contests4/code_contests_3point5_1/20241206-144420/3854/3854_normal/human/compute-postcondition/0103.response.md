According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration. Since all variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, the next iteration will have `j` incremented by 1 as well. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the new value of `n` which is `n + 1`.
State: After the execution of the if else block, all variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1. `j` is still less than or equal to `n + 1`.
