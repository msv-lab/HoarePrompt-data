Example Answer:
The value of `core[i]` will be printed. No variables are being modified or updated in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `core[i+2]` will be printed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than `n`.
Output State: **The value of `core[i+2]` will be printed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than `n`**
