Postcondition: ***All `nn[j]` are updated based on the conditions, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are assigned the value of `i + 1`, `d` is assigned a specific value, `cell[d]` is set to True, `j` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `n` is updated based on the conditions, `k` remains the same. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then the program executes the specified updates on the variables as described in the if part. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then the program executes the specified updates on the variables as described in the else part.***
