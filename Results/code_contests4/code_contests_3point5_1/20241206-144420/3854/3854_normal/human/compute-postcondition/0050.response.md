Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `d` are determined by the input values. For the loop to execute the next time `j` is incremented by 1 and the conditions related to `nn[j]`, `core[j]`, `cell[d]`, and `d` are updated. If `core[j] == 0`, then the following occurs: `d` is determined by the input values. `core[j]`, `core[nn[d]]`, `cell[i+2]`, and `cell[nn[d]+2]` are all integers. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `cell[d]` is true, then `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are updated to `i + 2`, and the corresponding indices in the `cell` list are set to `True`. If `nn[d] != 0`, then `nn[d]` is updated with the value of `j`. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
