According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `core[i+1]` was printed. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should not exceed `n`.
State: **The value of `core[i+2]` will be printed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than `n`**
