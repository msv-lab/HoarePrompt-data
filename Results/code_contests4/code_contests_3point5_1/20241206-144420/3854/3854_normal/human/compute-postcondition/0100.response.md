Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, all variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1. `j` is still less than or equal to `n`. `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. `(cell[d])` remains true. `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are updated to `i + 1`. `cell[d]` is set to True. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is updated to the current `j`.***
