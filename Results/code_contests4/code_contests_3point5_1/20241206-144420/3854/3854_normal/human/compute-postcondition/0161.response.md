Example Answer:
`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `d` is already assigned as `ins[j][i]`. Therefore, `nn[ins[j][i]]` is assigned the value `j`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `nn[ins[j][i]]` is assigned the value `j`**
