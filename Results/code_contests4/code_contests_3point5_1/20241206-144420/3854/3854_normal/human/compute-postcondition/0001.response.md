Example Answer: 
A 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m, where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided, so the size of the 2D list `ins` is dependent on these values. Therefore, the Output State is: values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided, and a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s.
Output State: **values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided, and a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s**
