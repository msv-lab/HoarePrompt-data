According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core` are already determined. In order for the loop to execute a second time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0 for all `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute the second time**
