Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core` are determined by the input values, `ins` contains the mapped integers from the input split by spaces for each index from 1 to n, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0, `nn[j]` is 0**
