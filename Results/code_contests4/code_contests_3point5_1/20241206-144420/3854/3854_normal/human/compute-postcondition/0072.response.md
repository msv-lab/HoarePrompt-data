According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is already determined and `m` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be set to 1, and `nn[j]` should be set to 0 for all `j` in the range [1, `k`]. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` is 0 for all `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute**
