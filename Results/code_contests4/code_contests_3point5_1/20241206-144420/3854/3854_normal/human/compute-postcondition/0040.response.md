Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`. The value of `ins[j][i]` depends on the input values, and the previous values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i`, and `d` are not mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: the value of `d` is determined by the input values.
Output State: **the value of `d` is determined by the input values**
