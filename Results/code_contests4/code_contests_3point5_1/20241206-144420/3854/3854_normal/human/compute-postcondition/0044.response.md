Example Answer: 
`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and both `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are `i + 1`. This means that `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are incremented by 1. The corresponding indices in the `cell` list for `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are set to `True`. Therefore, the Output State is: `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are `i + 2`, corresponding indices in the `cell` list are set to `True`.
Output State: **`core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are `i + 2`, corresponding indices in the `cell` list are set to `True`**
