Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core` are determined by the input values. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is k, `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0 for all j in the range [1, k]. Additionally, when `core[j]` equals 0, the program variables are in this state.***
