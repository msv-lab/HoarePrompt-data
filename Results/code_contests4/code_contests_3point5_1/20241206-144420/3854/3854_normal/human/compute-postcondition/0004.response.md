Example Answer:
The list `core` is initialized with zeros of length `n + 1`. The previous values of `n` determine the length of the list. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input; a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s; `cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with length k + 1; `nn` is a list of zeros with a length determined by the input, `core` is a list of zeros with a length of (n + 1).
Output State: **values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input; a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s; `cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with length k + 1; `nn` is a list of zeros with a length determined by the input, `core` is a list of zeros with a length of (n + 1)**
