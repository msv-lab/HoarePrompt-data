According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is determined. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2 and `k` should be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i` (incremented by 1), `j` is 2, `d` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, all `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`] for the loop to execute a second time**
