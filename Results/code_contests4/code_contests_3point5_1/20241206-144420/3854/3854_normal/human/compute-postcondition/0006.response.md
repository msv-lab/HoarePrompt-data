Example Answer:
The value of `ins` at index `i + 1` is assigned the result of mapping the input values to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input values are split based on spaces and converted to integers. The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` are determined by the input values.**
