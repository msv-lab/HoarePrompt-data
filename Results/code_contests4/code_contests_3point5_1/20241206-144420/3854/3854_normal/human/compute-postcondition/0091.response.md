According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `nn[j]` are 0 for `j` in the range [1, `k`], `core[j]` are equal to 0, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]` where `d` is not equal to 0, `(cell[d])` is true, and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, `core`, `i` incremented by 1, `j` incremented by 1, `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `(cell[d])` is true, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are updated to `i + 1`**
