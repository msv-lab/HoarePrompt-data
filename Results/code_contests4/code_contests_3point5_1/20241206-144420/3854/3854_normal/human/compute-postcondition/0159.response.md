The value `i + 1` is assigned to both `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]`, where `d` is the value of `ins[j][i]`. Therefore, after execution, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` will both have the value of `i + 1`. The value of `cell[d]` is set to True, but its effect on the output state is not explicitly mentioned. 
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is `i + 1`, `core[nn[d]]` is `i + 1`**
