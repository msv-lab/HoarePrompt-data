Example Answer:
`cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with length k + 1. The values of n, m, and k are not affected, and the 2D list `ins` remains initialized with 0s. Therefore, the Output State is: values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided, and a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s; `cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with length k + 1.
Output State: **values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input provided, and a 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0s; `cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with length k + 1**
