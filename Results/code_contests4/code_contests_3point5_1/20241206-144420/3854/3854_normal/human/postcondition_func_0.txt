The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, then populates the lists `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` accordingly. It processes these lists through nested loops, updating the values based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the values of `core` from `core[1]` to `core[n]` sequentially. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
