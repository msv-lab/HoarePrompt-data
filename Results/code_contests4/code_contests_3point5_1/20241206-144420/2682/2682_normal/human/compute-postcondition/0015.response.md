Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input lines containing student IDs, weights, and heights. It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each student using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height) and prints the student ID if their BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0. The function categorizes students into Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese based on their BMI. However, the function does not categorize students into specific BMI categories as mentioned in the annotations. It solely prints the student ID if their BMI is 25.0 or higher.**
