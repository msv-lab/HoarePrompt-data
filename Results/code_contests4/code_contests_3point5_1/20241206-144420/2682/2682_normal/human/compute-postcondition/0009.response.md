According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `weight` and `height`. If the condition 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) is true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the split function on the line variable. To execute the loop one more time, the condition 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) must still be true.
State: **`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the split function on the line variable. If 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height), for the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still be true**
