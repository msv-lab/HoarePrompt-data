Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `number` to the console. The values of `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned from the split function on the line variable. The specific values of `number`, `weight`, and `height` are unknown as they depend on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `number`, `weight`, and `height` have been assigned values from the split function on the line variable.
Output State: **`number`, `weight`, and `height` have been assigned values from the split function on the line variable**
