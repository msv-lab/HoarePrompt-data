Postcondition: ***Each student ID (si) is an integer between 1 and 2000, weight (wi) is a real number between 1 and 200, height (hi) is a real number between 1.0 and 2.0. The number of students does not exceed 50. If 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) ** 2, the program prints the variable `number`.***
