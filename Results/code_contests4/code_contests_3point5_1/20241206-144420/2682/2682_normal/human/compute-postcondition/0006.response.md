Example Answer:
The variables `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the `split` function on the `line` variable. The `split` function splits the `line` into substrings based on the delimiter ',' and assigns them to the variables. The previous values of the variables are unknown, as they depend on the input from stdin. Therefore, the Output State is: No specific state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute another time, as it depends on input from stdin. `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the split function on the line variable.
Output State: **No specific state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute another time, as it depends on input from stdin. `number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the split function on the line variable.**
