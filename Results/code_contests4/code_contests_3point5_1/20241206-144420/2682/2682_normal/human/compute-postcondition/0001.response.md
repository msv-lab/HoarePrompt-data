`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from `line.split(',')`. The variables `number` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `weight` is a real number between 1 and 200, and `height` is a real number between 1.0 and 2.0. 
Output State: **Each student ID (si) is an integer between 1 and 2000, weight (wi) is a real number between 1 and 200, height (hi) is a real number between 1.0 and 2.0. The number of students does not exceed 50, the first line in stdin is available to read.**
