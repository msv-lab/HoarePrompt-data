Output State: **The loop will iterate over each line from the input and check if the weight divided by the square of the height is greater than or equal to 25. If true, it will print the student ID. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be the student IDs that meet the condition 25.0 <= weight / height^2.**
