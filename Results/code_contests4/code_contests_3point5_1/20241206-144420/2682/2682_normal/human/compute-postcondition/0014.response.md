The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to return the BMI (Body Mass Index) category for each student based on their weight and height. The function should calculate the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height) and categorize the students into the following categories:
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
- Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
- Obese: BMI >= 30

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the BMI category for each student based on their weight and height.
