According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines in the input stream (stdin) to read. Since the number of students does not exceed 50, we can assume that there will be 50 lines in the input stream corresponding to each student's information. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
State: **Each student ID (si) is an integer between 1 and 2000, weight (wi) is a real number between 1 and 200, height (hi) is a real number between 1.0 and 2.0. The number of students does not exceed 50, the first line in stdin is available to read.**
