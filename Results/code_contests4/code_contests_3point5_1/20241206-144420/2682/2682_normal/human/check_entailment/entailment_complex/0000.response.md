Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program reads input lines containing student IDs, weights, and heights. It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each student using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height) and prints the student ID if their BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0, as required by the problem description. The program iterates over each student entry and correctly identifies students suspected of being obese based on their BMI value, which aligns with the problem description. The program also limits the input values to the specified ranges and constraints mentioned in the problem description. Overall, the program functions as intended and follows the requirements outlined in the problem description.
