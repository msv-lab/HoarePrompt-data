Correctness: **True**

The program reads student data from the input, calculates the BMI using the provided formula, and then checks if the BMI is greater than or equal to 25. If it is, the program prints the student ID. This aligns with the problem description which asks for the student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher to be output.

The program correctly calculates the BMI and identifies students who are suspected of being obese based on the BMI value, thus meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
