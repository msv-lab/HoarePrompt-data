Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads input lines containing student IDs, weights, and heights.
- It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each student using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height).
- It prints the student ID if their BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0.
- The output matches the problem description as it correctly identifies students with a BMI of 25 or higher.
- The code logic aligns with the problem statement and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not behave as expected.
