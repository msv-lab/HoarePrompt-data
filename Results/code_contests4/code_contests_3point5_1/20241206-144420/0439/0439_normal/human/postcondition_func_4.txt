The function func_3 processes an input grid based on specified rules. It takes no parameters explicitly. The function iterates over the elements in args, writing them to a file separated by 'sep' if necessary. It then writes the 'end' character to the file. If 'flush' is True in the kwargs, it flushes the file. However, the function does not have a return value.
