The function `func_2` reads user input to create a grid represented as a list of strings. It then checks the grid for specific conditions: if the grid is filled with only '#' characters, if each row contains at least one '#' character with no '.' characters in between, and if the transposed grid meets the same row condition. If any of these conditions are not met, the function calls `func_3(-1)`. The function also calls `func_1` with parameters based on the grid. The return value varies: nothing is returned in Cases 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7, nothing is returned in Case 2, and either -1 or the index of the character '.' is returned in Case 5.
