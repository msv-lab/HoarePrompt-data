The function `get_adj` accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing positions. It then generates a list of adjacent positions to the input positions `i` and `j` based on certain conditions. The conditions are that the adjacent positions must be within the grid boundaries (0 <= ai < n and 0 <= aj < m) and the grid value at that position must be '#'. The function returns a list of all valid adjacent positions that meet these conditions.
