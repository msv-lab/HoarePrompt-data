Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `m` elements with '#' characters, `grid` is the transpose of the `grid` list. The number of rows in the grid is equal to the number of columns in the original grid. The loop ensures that each row in the transposed grid contains at least one '#' character and no '.' characters in between them. If any row fails this condition, the function func_3(-1) is called and the loop terminates.**
