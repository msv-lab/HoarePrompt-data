The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function does not return any specific value in Cases 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. In Case 2, the program returns nothing. In Case 5, the program returns either -1 or the index of the character '.' in the row list from index `start` to `stop`, inclusive. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to handle different cases based on the input grid and return specific values or nothing accordingly.
