Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters i and j representing the coordinates of a cell in a 2D grid. The input grid is a 2D grid of characters with dimensions n x m where each cell contains either "#" or ".". The function attempts to traverse the grid using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to visit all cells. However, there seems to be an issue in the DFS implementation where the component value is always set to 1 instead of accurately counting the connected component size. Therefore, the function does not correctly return the component value after all cells in the input grid have been visited and marked as visited.**
