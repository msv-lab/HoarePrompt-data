Example Answer:
The code snippet `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` unpacks values from the dictionary `kwargs`. If `sep` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space character ' '. If `file` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. Since the initial state does not mention the presence of `kwargs`, the values of `sep` and `file` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: There is no change in the values of `sep` and `file`.
Output State: **There is no change in the values of `sep` and `file`**
