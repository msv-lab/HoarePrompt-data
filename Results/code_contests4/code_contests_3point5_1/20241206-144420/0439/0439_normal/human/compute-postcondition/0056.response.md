Postcondition: ***n and m are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid is a 2D grid of characters with dimensions n x m where each cell contains either "#" or ".", component is 1, stack contains the tuple (i, j) and for the loop to execute again the stack is not empty. If visited[si][sj] is true, then the loop has already visited the cell at coordinates si, sj. Otherwise, component is 1, and the stack contains all pairs (ai, aj) where visited[ai][aj] is false after all iterations of the loop have finished. If visited[si][sj] is true, then the loop has already visited the cell at coordinates si, sj. If visited[si][sj] is false, then visited[ai][aj] is False for all ai, aj, component is 1, and the stack contains all tuples (ai, aj) where visited[ai][aj] is False.***
