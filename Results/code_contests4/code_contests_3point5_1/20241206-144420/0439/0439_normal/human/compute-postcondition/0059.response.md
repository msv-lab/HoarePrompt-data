The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `i` and `j`, which are integers representing the coordinates of a cell in a 2D grid. The input grid is a 2D grid of characters with dimensions n x m where each cell contains either "#" or ".". The function returns the component value after all cells in the input grid have been visited and marked as visited.
