Example Answer:
`start` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of '#' in the new row, and `stop` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of '#' in the new row by using the `find` and `rfind` methods respectively. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements with '#' characters, `grid` is the transpose of the `grid` list, the number of rows left in the grid is greater than the new current row index. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements with '#' characters, `grid` is the transpose of the `grid` list, the number of rows left in the grid is greater than the new current row index, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#' in the new row, `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in the new row.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements with '#' characters, `grid` is the transpose of the `grid` list, the number of rows left in the grid is greater than the new current row index, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#' in the new row, `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in the new row**
