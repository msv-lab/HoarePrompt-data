According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `args`. If `args` is a non-empty iterable, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` and `file` have no change, and `at_start` is True. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `args` needs to be a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element in `args`.
State: **`sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`**
