According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are remaining elements in the `args` iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is False, `args` still has remaining elements, the value of `x` has been written to the file. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `args` needs to be processed.
State: **`sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with remaining elements, the value of the next element in `args` needs to be processed**
