Example Answer:
The variables `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in each row of the grid. The values of `start` and `stop` will vary based on the input grid. Since the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, and `grit` are not affected by this code snippet, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements with '#' characters, `grit` is the transpose of the `grid` list.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements with '#' characters, `grit` is the transpose of the `grid` list**
