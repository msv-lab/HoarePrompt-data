According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of the get_adj(si, sj) function, which returns a list of tuples (ai, aj). If the list has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, visited[si][sj] is True and component is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to at least one tuple returned by the get_adj(si, sj) function, and ai and aj are the values of the first tuple in the list.
State: **visited[si][sj] is True, component is 1, for the loop to execute the first time at least one tuple is returned by get_adj(si, sj), ai and aj are the values of the first tuple in the list**
