Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000. `grid` is a list containing `n` elements with '#' characters. `grid` is the transpose of the `grid` list. The number of rows left in the grid is greater than the new current row index. `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#' in the new row. `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in the new row. If `start` is -1 or '.' in row[start:stop + 1], the program does not return any specific value. Otherwise, None.***
