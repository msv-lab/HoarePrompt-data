Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements with '#' characters, `grid` is the transpose of the `grid` list, and the number of rows left in the grid is greater than the current row index, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of '#' in a row, `stop` is the index of the last occurrence of '#' in a row. If `start` is equal to -1 or '.' is present in the row from `start` to `stop` (inclusive), there is an error in the input. Otherwise, the program has no effect on the state of the variables.***
