Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file. The values of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with remaining elements, the value of the next element in `args` needs to be processed.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with remaining elements, the value of the next element in `args` needs to be processed**
