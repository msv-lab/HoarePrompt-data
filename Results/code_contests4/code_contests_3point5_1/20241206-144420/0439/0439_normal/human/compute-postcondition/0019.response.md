Example Answer:
The `end` key is popped from `kwargs` with a default value of '\n', which is then written to the file. The states of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is False, `args` is an empty iterable.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is False, `args` is an empty iterable**
