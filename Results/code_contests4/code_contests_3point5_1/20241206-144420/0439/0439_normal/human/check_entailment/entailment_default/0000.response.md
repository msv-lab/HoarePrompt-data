Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where a north magnet can occupy a white cell after some sequence of operations. This violates the rule that if a cell is colored white, then it should be impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. The code does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect behavior.
