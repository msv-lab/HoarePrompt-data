You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care.

There is an n× m grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell.

An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable.

Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.

  1. There is at least one south magnet in every row and every column. 
  2. If a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 
  3. If a cell is colored white, then it is impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 



Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

The next n lines describe the coloring. The i-th of these lines contains a string of length m, where the j-th character denotes the color of the cell in row i and column j. The characters "#" and "." represent black and white, respectively. It is guaranteed, that the string will not contain any other characters.

Output

Output a single integer, the minimum possible number of north magnets required.

If there is no placement of magnets that satisfies all conditions, print a single integer -1.

Note

In the first test, here is an example placement of magnets:

<image>

In the second test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are three example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 3 since we can move the north magnet down onto a white square. The second example violates rule 2 since we cannot move the north magnet to the bottom-left black square by any sequence of operations. The third example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first column.

<image>

In the third test, here is an example placement of magnets. We can show that there is no required placement of magnets with fewer north magnets.

<image>

In the fourth test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are two example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first row. The second example violates rules 1 and 3 since there is no south magnet in the second row and we can move the north magnet up one unit onto a white square.

<image>

In the fifth test, we can put the south magnet in each cell and no north magnets. Because there are no black cells, it will be a correct placement.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. grid is a 2D list of characters representing the coloring of the cells in the grid. Each character in grid is either "#" (black) or "." (white).**

                components += dfs(i, j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `components` is the sum of the return values of `dfs(i, j)` for all valid `i` and `j` values where `not visited[i][j]` is False and `grid[i][j]` is '#'. `i` is equal to n-1, `j` is equal to m-1, `visited[i][j]` is False, `grid[i][j]` is equal to '#'
    return components
    #The program returns the sum of the return values of `dfs(n-1, m-1)` for all valid `i` and `j` where `not visited[i][j]` is False and `grid[i][j]` is '#'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `grid`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing the coloring of the cells in the grid, where each character in `grid` is either "#" (black) or "." (white). After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of the return values of `dfs(n-1, m-1)` for all valid `i` and `j` where `not visited[i][j]` is False and `grid[i][j]` is '#'. The functionality does not cover what happens if `grid[i][j]` is '.', any potential error handling within the `dfs` function, or how the `visited` list is updated during the execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def get_adj(i, j):
    adj = [(i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i - 1, j), (i, j - 1)]
    res = []
    for (ai, aj) in adj:
        if 0 <= ai < n and 0 <= aj < m and grid[ai][aj] == '#':
            res.append((ai, aj))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `adj` is defined with all adjacent positions that meet the conditions stated in the loop. If 0 <= ai < n and 0 <= aj < m and grid[ai][aj] == '#', then all valid positions are appended to the `res` list.
    return res
    #The program returns a list of all adjacent positions that meet the conditions stated in the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_adj` accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`, representing positions. It then generates a list of adjacent positions to the input positions `i` and `j` based on certain conditions. The conditions are that the adjacent positions must be within the grid boundaries (0 <= ai < n and 0 <= aj < m) and the grid value at that position must be '#'. The function returns a list of all valid adjacent positions that meet these conditions.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000. The input grid is a 2D grid of characters with dimensions n x m where each cell contains either "#" or ".".**
def dfs(i, j):
    component, stack = 1, [(i, j)]
    while stack:
        si, sj = stack[-1]
        
        if visited[si][sj]:
            stack.pop()
            continue
        else:
            visited[si][sj] = True
            component = 1
            for ai, aj in get_adj(si, sj):
                if not visited[ai][aj]:
                    stack.append((ai, aj))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000, input grid is a 2D grid of characters with dimensions n x m where each cell contains either "#" or ".", component is 1, stack is empty. All cells in the grid have been visited, and the loop has terminated with all cells marked as visited.
    return component
    #The program returns the component value after all cells in the input grid have been visited and marked as visited.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters i and j representing the coordinates of a cell in a 2D grid. The input grid is a 2D grid of characters with dimensions n x m where each cell contains either "#" or ".". The function attempts to traverse the grid using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to visit all cells. However, there seems to be an issue in the DFS implementation where the component value is always set to 1 instead of accurately counting the connected component size. Therefore, the function does not correctly return the component value after all cells in the input grid have been visited and marked as visited.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n,m <= 1000. The input grid is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains only '#' and '.' characters.**
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    if (grid == [('.' * m) for _ in range(n)]) :
        func_3(0)
        return
        #The program does not return any specific value
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements input by the user. The `grid` list is not equal to ['.' * m for _ in range(n)]
    for row in grid:
        start, stop = row.find('#'), row.rfind('#')
        
        if start == -1 or '.' in row[start:stop + 1]:
            func_3(-1)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements input by the user, where each row in the grid contains '#' characters with no '.' characters in between them.
    grit = transpose(grid)
    for row in grit:
        start, stop = row.find('#'), row.rfind('#')
        
        if start == -1 or '.' in row[start:stop + 1]:
            func_3(-1)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `grid` is a list containing `m` elements with '#' characters, `grid` is the transpose of the `grid` list. The number of rows in the grid is equal to the number of columns in the original grid. The loop ensures that each row in the transposed grid contains at least one '#' character and no '.' characters in between them. If any row fails this condition, the function func_3(-1) is called and the loop terminates.
    func_3(func_1(n, m, grid))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads user input to create a grid represented as a list of strings. It then checks the grid for specific conditions: if the grid is filled with only '#' characters, if each row contains at least one '#' character with no '.' characters in between, and if the transposed grid meets the same row condition. If any of these conditions are not met, the function calls `func_3(-1)`. The function also calls `func_1` with parameters based on the grid. The return value varies: nothing is returned in Cases 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7, nothing is returned in Case 2, and either -1 or the index of the character '.' is returned in Case 5.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The input grid consists of n lines, each containing a string of length m where each character is either "#" or ".".**
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` and `file` have no change, `at_start` is False, `args` is an empty iterable
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` and `file` remain unchanged, `at_start` is still False, `args` is an empty iterable. If 'flush' key is present in kwargs and its value is True, then the key is removed. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 processes an input grid based on specified rules. It takes no parameters explicitly. The function iterates over the elements in args, writing them to a file separated by 'sep' if necessary. It then writes the 'end' character to the file. If 'flush' is True in the kwargs, it flushes the file. However, the function does not have a return value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
