Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input grid and checks if there is a valid placement of magnets that satisfies all conditions as described in the problem statement.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the minimum number of north magnets required based on the grid provided.
3. The `func_2` function reads the input, checks for invalid placements, and then calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum number of north magnets required.
4. The program handles all edge cases and conditions specified in the problem description.
5. The logic of checking for valid placements and calculating the minimum number of north magnets is correctly implemented.
6. The program structure and implementation align with the problem requirements.
