Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input grid and checks if there is a valid placement of magnets that satisfies all conditions.
- It uses DFS to find the number of connected components in the grid, which represents the minimum number of north magnets required.
- It handles cases where the input grid has only white cells or invalid placements of magnets, returning -1 in those cases.
- The program correctly handles all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and provides the minimum number of north magnets required.
