Correctness: False

Explanation: The given program has multiple issues that make it incorrect:
1. The `fac` list is not being updated correctly within the `func_7()` function. The `fac` list is defined globally, but inside the `func_7()` function, a local list is created with the same name, and this local list is being updated instead of the global one.
2. The calculation of `ways` within the loop in `func_7()` is incorrect. The `func_6()` function should be called with the proper parameters, but it is not being done correctly.
3. The calculation of `ans` within the loop is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above, leading to incorrect results.

Overall, the program does not correctly calculate the sum of f(S) over all possible ways as described in the problem statement.
