The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b, calculates the sum of a and b in variable c, and returns the value of c. If the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the variable mod, it subtracts mod from c before returning it. If the sum of a and b is less than mod, c remains unchanged.
