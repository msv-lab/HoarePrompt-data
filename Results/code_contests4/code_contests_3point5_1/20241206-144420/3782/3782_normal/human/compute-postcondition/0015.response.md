Example Answer:
`ways` is assigned the value returned by `func_6` with parameters `n` and `k` and `fac`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `fac` are provided by the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`.
Output State: **`fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`**
