Output State: **`fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[n-1], a[n-2])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n, k, fac)), the value of `ans` is printed.**
