According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to n + 5. 
Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are positive integers with 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of integers, `fac` is a list of integers with a length of n + 5, and `fac[0]` is set to 1. 
To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 1.
State: **N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N, A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9, n and k are assigned values based on user input(), a is assigned a list of integers after splitting the input string, fac is a list of integers initialized with a length of n + 5, fac[0] is set to 1, i is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
