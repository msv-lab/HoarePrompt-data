Output State: **`fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`**
