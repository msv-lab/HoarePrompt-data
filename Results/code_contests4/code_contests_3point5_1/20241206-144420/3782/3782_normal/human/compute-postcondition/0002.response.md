Example Answer:
The list `fac` is initialized with a length of `n + 5` where `n` is the value input by the user. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N, A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9, n and k are assigned values based on user input(), `a` is assigned a list of integers after splitting the input string, and `fac` is a list of integers initialized with a length of n + 5.
