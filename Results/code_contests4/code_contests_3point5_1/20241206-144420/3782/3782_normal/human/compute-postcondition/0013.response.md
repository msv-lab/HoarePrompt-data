According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. The initial state indicates that `fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i`, starting from `fac[0] = 1` and updating up to `fac[n+4]`. The list `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that:
1. `n` is at least 2 for the loop to start.
2. The values in `fac` are calculated correctly up to index `n+4`.
3. The list `a` remains sorted in ascending order.
4. `ans` remains 0.

State: **`fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 2**
