Example Answer: 
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The order of elements in the list `a` is changed to be in sorted order. The values in the list `a` are not provided in the initial state, so the specific sorted values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: fac contains the values calculated by func_3 for each index i, with fac[0] = 1 and fac[1] to fac[n+4] updated accordingly, and list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **fac contains the values calculated by func_3 for each index i, with fac[0] = 1 and fac[1] to fac[n+4] updated accordingly, and list `a` is sorted in ascending order**
