According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is based on user input. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to 3.
State: **N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N, A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9, n and k are assigned values based on user input(), a is assigned a list of integers after splitting the input string, fac is a list of integers initialized with a length of n + 5, fac[0] is set to 1, i is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, fac[3] is updated based on the result of func_3(fac[2], 3), fac[i] is assigned the value returned by func_3(fac[i - 1], i)**
