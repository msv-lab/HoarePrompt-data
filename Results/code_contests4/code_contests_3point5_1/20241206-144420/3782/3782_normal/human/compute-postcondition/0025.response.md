According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ways` is updated by applying `func_2` on the current value of `ways` and the result of `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `diff` is updated with the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ways` is updated with the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))`, and `ans` is updated with the result of `func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways)).

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ways` is updated by applying `func_2` on the current value of `ways` and the result of `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 2` for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
