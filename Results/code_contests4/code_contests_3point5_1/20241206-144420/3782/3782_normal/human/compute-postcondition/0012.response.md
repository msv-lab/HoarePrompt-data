Example Answer:
`ans` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `fac` contains the values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i`, with `fac[0] = 1` and `fac[1]` to `fac[n+4]` updated accordingly, list `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`fac` contains the values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i`, with `fac[0] = 1` and `fac[1]` to `fac[n+4]` updated accordingly, list `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0**.
