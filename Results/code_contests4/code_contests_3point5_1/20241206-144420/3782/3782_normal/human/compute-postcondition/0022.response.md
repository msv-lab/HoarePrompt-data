Output State: **`fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, `ways` is updated by applying `func_2` on the current value of `ways` and the result of `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `diff` is updated with the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])**
