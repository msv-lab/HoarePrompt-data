According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))` which is updated by applying `func_6` on `n - i - 1, k, fac`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 which means `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`, and `n` should be greater than `n - 1`.

State: **`fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))` which is updated by applying `func_6` on `n - i - 1, k, fac`, `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
