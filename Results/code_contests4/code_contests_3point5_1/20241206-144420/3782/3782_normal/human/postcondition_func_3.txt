The function `func_4` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where 1 <= b <= a. It has three return cases:
1. If `b` is equal to 0, the function returns 1.
2. If `b` is odd, the function recursively calls `func_3` with parameters `a` and the result of `func_4` with parameters `a` and `b-1`.
3. If `b` is even, the function recursively calculates the square of the value returned by calling itself with parameters `a` and `b/2`.
Therefore, the functionality of the function is to perform recursive calculations based on the parity of `b` and return different values accordingly.
