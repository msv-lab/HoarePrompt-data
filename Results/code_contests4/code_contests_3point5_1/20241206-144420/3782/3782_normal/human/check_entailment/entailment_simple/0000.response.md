Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K elements from the given list such that f(S) is the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the chosen set S. The program follows the problem description by calculating the combination of choosing K elements from N, sorting the list, and iterating through all possible pairs to compute the required sum. It also correctly applies modulo operation as required. The functions defined in the program help in calculating the necessary values and ensure that the final answer is computed correctly.
