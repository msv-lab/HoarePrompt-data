You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.

Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.

We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.

Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq N
* |A_i| \leq 10^9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
A_1 ... A_N


Output

Print the answer \bmod (10^9+7).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `c` are integers. If `a + b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is subtracted by `mod`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `a`, `b`, `c`.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of 'c' after checking if 'a + b' is greater than or equal to 'mod' and subtracting 'mod' from 'c' if the condition is met.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a - b) % mod
    #The program returns the result of subtracting variable 'b' from variable 'a' and then taking the modulo 'mod' of the result

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_3(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of the product of integers a and b modulo mod. The variables a and b are positive integers, and mod is a positive integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_4(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9. b is not equal to 0
    if (b % 2 == 1) :
        return func_3(a, func_4(a, b - 1))
        #The program returns the result of calling function func_3 with parameters a and the result of calling function func_4 with parameters a and b-1
    else :
        temp = func_4(a, b / 2)
        return temp * temp
        #The program returns the square of the value returned by func_4(a, b / 2)

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(a):
    return func_4(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of calling the function func_4 with parameters 'a' and 'mod - 2'

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, and |A_i| <= 10^9 for each element A_i in the list.**
def func_6(n, k, fac):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, and |A_i| <= 10^9 for each element A_i in the list. k is less than or equal to n
    return func_3(fac[n], func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])))
    #The program returns the result of calling function func_3 with fac[n] as the first argument and the result of calling function func_5 with the result of calling function func_3 with fac[n-k] and fac[k] as arguments

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_7():
    n, k = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    fac = [0] * (n + 5)
    fac[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 5):
        fac[i] = func_3(fac[i - 1], i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: fac contains the values calculated by func_3 for each index i, with fac[0] = 1 and fac[1] to fac[n+4] updated accordingly
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
        
        ways = func_6(n, k, fac)
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))
        
        ans = func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[n-1], a[n-2])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n, k, fac))`
    print(ans)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
