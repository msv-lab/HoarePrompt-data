You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.

Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.

We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.

Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq N
* |A_i| \leq 10^9

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `c` are integers. If `a + b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is subtracted by `mod`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `a`, `b`, `c`.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of 'c' after checking if 'a + b' is greater than or equal to 'mod' and subtracting 'mod' from 'c' if the condition is met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b, calculates the sum of a and b in variable c, and returns the value of c. If the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the variable mod, it subtracts mod from c before returning it. If the sum of a and b is less than mod, c remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a - b) % mod
    #The program returns the result of subtracting variable 'b' from variable 'a' and then taking the modulo 'mod' of the result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the result of subtracting `b` from `a` and then taking the modulo 'mod' of the result. The function does not handle the case where `mod` is not defined or initialized, which could lead to an error.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_3(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of the product of integers a and b modulo mod. The variables a and b are positive integers, and mod is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers a and b, along with a positive integer mod, and returns the result of the product of a and b modulo mod. The code accurately calculates the product of a and b modulo mod. However, a potential edge case to consider is if the product of a and b exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type used, which could lead to an overflow issue. This aspect is not addressed in the annotations.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_4(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9. b is not equal to 0
    if (b % 2 == 1) :
        return func_3(a, func_4(a, b - 1))
        #The program returns the result of calling function func_3 with parameters a and the result of calling function func_4 with parameters a and b-1
    else :
        temp = func_4(a, b / 2)
        return temp * temp
        #The program returns the square of the value returned by func_4(a, b / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where 1 <= b <= a. It has three return cases:
1. If `b` is equal to 0, the function returns 1.
2. If `b` is odd, the function recursively calls `func_3` with parameters `a` and the result of `func_4` with parameters `a` and `b-1`.
3. If `b` is even, the function recursively calculates the square of the value returned by calling itself with parameters `a` and `b/2`.
Therefore, the functionality of the function is to perform recursive calculations based on the parity of `b` and return different values accordingly.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(a):
    return func_4(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of calling the function func_4 with parameters 'a' and 'mod - 2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `a` and returns the result of calling the function `func_4` with parameters 'a' and 'mod - 2'. The functionality does not provide details on the behavior of `func_4` or the value of `mod`. It assumes that `func_4` exists with the specified parameters.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, and |A_i| <= 10^9 for each element A_i in the list.**
def func_6(n, k, fac):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, and |A_i| <= 10^9 for each element A_i in the list. k is less than or equal to n
    return func_3(fac[n], func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])))
    #The program returns the result of calling function func_3 with fac[n] as the first argument and the result of calling function func_5 with the result of calling function func_3 with fac[n-k] and fac[k] as arguments
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts three parameters `n`, `k`, and `fac`. It then checks if `k` is greater than `n` and returns 0 in that case. Otherwise, it returns the result of nested function calls involving values from the list `fac`. The functionality is dependent on the relation between `n` and `k`, and the values stored in `fac`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_7():
    n, k = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    fac = [0] * (n + 5)
    fac[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 5):
        fac[i] = func_3(fac[i - 1], i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: fac contains the values calculated by func_3 for each index i, with fac[0] = 1 and fac[1] to fac[n+4] updated accordingly
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
        
        ways = func_6(n, k, fac)
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))
        
        ans = func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fac` contains values calculated by `func_3` for each index `i` starting from `fac[0] = 1` up to `fac[n+4]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is updated by applying `func_1` on the previous value of `ans`, `func_3(diff, ways)`, `n` is at least 2, `diff` is assigned the result of `func_2(a[n-1], a[n-2])`, and `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(n, k, fac))`
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads input values `n`, `k`, and a list `a`, calculates factorial values using `func_3`, sorts the list `a`, and performs various calculations on `a` elements based on `n`, `k`, and factorial values. After the computations, it prints the final result `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
