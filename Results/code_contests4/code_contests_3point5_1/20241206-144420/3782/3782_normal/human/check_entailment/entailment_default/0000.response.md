Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints suggest that the code should calculate the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K integers from the given set and finding the maximum difference between the chosen integers. However, upon examining the code, it seems that the calculations are not performed in accordance with the problem description. The function `func_7` reads the input values, sorts the list of integers, and then performs calculations on the differences between adjacent elements and the ways of choosing the integers. The final result is printed as `ans`, but the code does not appear to accurately calculate the sum of f(S) as described in the problem statement.

An example case where the code does not work correctly:
Input:
4 2
1 1 1 1

Expected Output:
0

Actual Output (Based on the code):
1

In this case, the code does not handle the scenario where all integers in the set are the same (1 in this case) and should result in a sum of 0 for f(S). This discrepancy between the expected and actual output indicates that the code is incorrect.
