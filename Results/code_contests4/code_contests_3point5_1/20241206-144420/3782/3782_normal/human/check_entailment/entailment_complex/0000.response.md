Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. In the `func_7` function, the calculation of the `ans` variable based on the values of `diff` and `ways` does not accurately represent the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K elements from the set. The logic within the for loop does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not produce the expected output for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
