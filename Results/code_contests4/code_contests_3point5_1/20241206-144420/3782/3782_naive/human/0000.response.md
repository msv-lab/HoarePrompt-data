Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K integers from the list A. It follows the problem description by calculating the maximum and minimum values of the chosen set and then finding the difference between them. The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid overflow. Additionally, the program calculates the number of ways to choose K integers using combinations accurately. 

Overall, the program seems to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and produces the expected output for the provided examples.
