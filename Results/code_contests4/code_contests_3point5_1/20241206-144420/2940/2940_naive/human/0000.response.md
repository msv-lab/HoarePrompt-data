Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description and checks all the conditions stated. It iterates through the given parts of the journey, updates Limak's height based on the direction, and ensures that Limak ends at the North Pole. It also checks if Limak's height goes out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than the specified height). The program prints "YES" if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise "NO". 

I have analyzed the code and all the examples provided, and in each case, the program produces the correct output according to the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program is verified to be true.
