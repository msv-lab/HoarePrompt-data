Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input correctly and iterates through each part of Limak's journey.
- It correctly adjusts Limak's height based on the direction he is moving.
- It checks if Limak's height goes below 0 or above the predefined constant height and updates a flag `sat` accordingly.
- Finally, it checks if Limak ends his journey at the North Pole and prints "YES" if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise "NO".
- The program covers all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and handles different input cases.
