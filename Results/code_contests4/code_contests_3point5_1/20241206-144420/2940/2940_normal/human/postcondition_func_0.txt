The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, processes a series of movements (North or South) with corresponding distances, updates the height based on the movements, and checks if the final height is equal to the predefined constant HEIGHT. If the final height matches HEIGHT, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
