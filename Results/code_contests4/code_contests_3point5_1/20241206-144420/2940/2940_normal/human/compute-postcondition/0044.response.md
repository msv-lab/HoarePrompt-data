Output State: **`n`, `ti`, `diri`, `dir`, `diri`, `dst`, `i`, `f` are positive integers/strings/constants. If `direction` = 'South', `height` is decreased by the integer value obtained from `dst`. If `direction` = 'North', `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst`. If `direction` is not in {'South', 'North'}, no changes occur in the program state.**
