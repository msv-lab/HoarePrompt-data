According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, Each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, sat is False, `dst` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute the next time `i` must be less than `n+1`**
