Example Answer:
The variable `height` is assigned the value of `HEIGHT`, which is 20000. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, height is 20000.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, height is 20000**
