According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n` considering the range function. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, sat is False, dst is a string, i is incremented by 1**
