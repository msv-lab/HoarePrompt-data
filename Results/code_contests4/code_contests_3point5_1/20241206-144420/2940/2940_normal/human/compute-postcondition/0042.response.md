Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, Each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, sat is False, `dst` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1, `dst` is assigned the first value after stripping and splitting the input read from sys.stdin. If `direction` is 'North', `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst`. If `direction` is not 'North', no changes occur in the program state.***
