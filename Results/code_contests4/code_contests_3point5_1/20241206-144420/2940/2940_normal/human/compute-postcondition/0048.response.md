Output State: **`n`, `ti`, `diri`, `dir`, `diri`, `dst`, `i`, `f`, `sat` are all positive integers/strings/constants. If `height` is less than 0 or greater than `HEIGHT`, `sat` is False. If `direction` = 'South', `height` is decreased by the integer value obtained from `dst`. If `direction` = 'North', `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst`. If `direction` is not in {'South', 'North'}, no changes occur in the program state. `sat` is updated to be the result of the logical AND operation between its current value and the comparison `height == HEIGHT`.**
