Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, sat is True, dst is a string. If direction is 'South', the height is decreased by the integer value of dst. If direction is 'North', the height is updated to 20000 + int(dst). If direction is neither 'South' nor 'North', the program variables remain in the same state as before the execution of the if else block.***
