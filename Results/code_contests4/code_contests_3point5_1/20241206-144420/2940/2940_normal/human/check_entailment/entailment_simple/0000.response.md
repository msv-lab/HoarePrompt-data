Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values, updates the height based on the given directions, and checks if the final height is equal to the starting height (North Pole). It also handles the conditions where Limak can only move from North to South or from South to North. The program correctly outputs "YES" if all conditions are satisfied, and "NO" otherwise.

The program ensures that Limak ends his journey on the North Pole, and it follows the rules specified in the problem description for each step of the journey.
