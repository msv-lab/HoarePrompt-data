Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of movements and their directions correctly.
- It updates the height based on the movements (subtracting for South, adding for North).
- It checks if the final height is within the specified range (0 to 20,000).
- Finally, it correctly prints 'YES' if the final height is equal to the predefined constant HEIGHT and 'NO' otherwise.

After carefully analyzing the code and the problem description, we can see that the code follows all the conditions mentioned in the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the code is correctly implementing the specified conditions. Thus, the code is correct.
