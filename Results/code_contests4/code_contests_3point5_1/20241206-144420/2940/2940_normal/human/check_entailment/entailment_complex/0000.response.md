Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input and processes the movements according to the problem description. It correctly updates the height based on the direction and distance of each movement and checks if Limak ends up on the North Pole at the end of the journey. The conditions specified in the problem description are satisfied in the program. Therefore, the program follows the problem description accurately.

Additionally, the program accounts for the conditions where Limak can only move from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa, and it ensures that the final position is the North Pole. The final decision of whether the description is valid or not is made based on whether the final height matches the predefined constant HEIGHT.
