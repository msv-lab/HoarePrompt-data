You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.

Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 

  * i + 1 = j 
  * max(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}) < min(h_i, h_j) 
  * max(h_i, h_j) < min(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}). 



At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — total amount of skyscrapers.

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — heights of skyscrapers.

Output

Print single number k — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5.

In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.

Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: 1 → 3 → 5.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
