Correctness: **True**

The program implements the logic described in the problem statement to calculate the minimal amount of discrete jumps needed to reach the last skyscraper. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum jumps required at each skyscraper. The implementation considers the conditions for a jump to be discrete as mentioned in the problem description.

The program iterates over the heights of the skyscrapers, maintaining two stacks to store the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far. It updates the minimum jumps required based on the heights and indices stored in the stacks.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for the given examples. Since the logic is correctly implemented and there are no identified potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
