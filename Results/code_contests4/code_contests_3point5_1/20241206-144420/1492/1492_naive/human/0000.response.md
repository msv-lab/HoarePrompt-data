Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimal amount of discrete jumps required for Vasya to reach the n-th skyscraper. It utilizes dynamic programming and stack data structures to keep track of the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far. The program considers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, ensuring that Vasya can make the jumps with the least number of discrete jumps possible. The program also handles the given constraints of the input properly. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the problem description, the program is correct for all potential cases.
