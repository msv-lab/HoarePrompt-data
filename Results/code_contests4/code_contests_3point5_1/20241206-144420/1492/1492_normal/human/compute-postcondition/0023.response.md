According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. The loop will execute if the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. Right before the loop, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, and `x` is the first element of `ar`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `first` should be less than the first element of `ar`, and `maxstack` should not be empty.

State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` contains 0, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `maxstack` should not be empty and the first element of `ar` should be greater than the first element of `maxstack`**
