Example Answer:
`minidx` is updated after removing the top element. For the loop to execute again, `minidx` should not be empty and `minidx[-1]` should be greater than `x`. 
Output State: **minstack is updated after removing the top element, for the loop to execute again minstack should not be empty and minstack[-1] should be greater than x**
