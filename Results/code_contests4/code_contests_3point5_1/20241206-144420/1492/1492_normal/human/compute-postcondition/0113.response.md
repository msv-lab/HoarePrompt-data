According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x`. If `maxstack` is not empty and the top element of `maxstack` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, and `maxstack` may be non-empty with the top element less than `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `maxstack` remains non-empty and the top element is still less than `x`.
State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `maxstack` is non-empty with the top element less than `x` for the loop to execute again**
