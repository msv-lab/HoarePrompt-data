Example Answer:
`minidx` removes the last element from its list. The previous state of `minidx` is not given, so we can't determine the exact value that was removed. Therefore, the Output State is: All the conditions remain the same for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **All the conditions remain the same for the loop to execute one more time**
