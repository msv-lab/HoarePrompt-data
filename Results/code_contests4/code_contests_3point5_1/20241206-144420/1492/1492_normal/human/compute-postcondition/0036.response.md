Postcondition: ***`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` is empty, `maxidx` is an empty list, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `minidx` is not empty, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `dp[i]` and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. Additionally, `maxidx` is not empty.***
