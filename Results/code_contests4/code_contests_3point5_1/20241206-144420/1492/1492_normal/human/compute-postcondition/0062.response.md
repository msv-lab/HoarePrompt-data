Example Answer:
The last element of `minstack` is removed by using the `pop()` method. Since the `pop()` method removes the last element of a list, `minstack` will have one less element after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` has one less element.
Output State: **`minstack` has one less element**
