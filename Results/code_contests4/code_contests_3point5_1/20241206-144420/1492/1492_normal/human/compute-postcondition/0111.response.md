Example Answer:
The top element of `maxstack` is removed by `maxstack.pop()`, and the states of `minstack` and `minidx` are not affected. The loop can be executed again as long as `maxstack` is non-empty and the top element is less than `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `maxstack` may be non-empty with the top element less than `x`.
Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `maxstack` may be non-empty with the top element less than `x`**
