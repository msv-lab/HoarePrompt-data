According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ar` and the index `i`. If the index `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the new element `x`, `maxidx` contains the index `i`, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar` and a new element `x`, `minidx` contains the index `i`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should be less than the length of `ar`.
State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the new element `x`, `maxidx` contains the index `i`, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar` and a new element `x`, `minidx` contains the index `i`, `i` is 1**.
