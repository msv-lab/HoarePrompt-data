Output State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the previous element plus 1, `maxstack` contains the new element `x`, `maxidx` contains the index `i`, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` contains the index `i`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `x` should be such that `minstack[-1] > x` is true.**
