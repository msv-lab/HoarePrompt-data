According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition that `minstack` is not empty and the last element in `minstack` is greater than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, the last element in `minstack` is greater than `x`, which is the condition for the loop to execute one more time. However, since `minstack.pop()` removes the last element, for the loop to execute again, `minstack` should not be empty after this operation. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `minstack` should have at least one element after `minstack.pop()` operation.
State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` contains 0, `minstack` contains the value of `first` and after one less element as `minstack.pop()` was performed, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `dp` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` should have at least one element after `minstack.pop()` operation**
