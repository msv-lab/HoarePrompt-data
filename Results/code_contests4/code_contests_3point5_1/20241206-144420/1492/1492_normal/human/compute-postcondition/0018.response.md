Output State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` contains 0, `minstack` contains the value of `first` and the last element in `minstack` is greater than `x`, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `dp` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute one more time. `minstack` has one less element as `minstack.pop()` removes the last element.**
