Postcondition: ***`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the previous element plus 1, `maxstack` contains the new element `x` or `maxstack[-1] is greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` no longer contains the last index, `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `i` is 1, `maxstack` is not empty and `maxstack[-1]` is less than `x`, the condition `minidx` is true, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1, `maxidx` holds a value, and the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x` if the top element of `minstack` is equal to `x`.***
