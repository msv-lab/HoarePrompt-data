According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `maxstack` must not be empty and the last element of `maxstack` must be less than `x` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `maxstack` should not be empty
- The last element of `maxstack` should be less than `x`

State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the previous element plus 1, `maxstack` contains the new element `x` or `maxstack[-1] is greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` no longer contains the last index, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` contains the index `i`, `i` is 1, `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, for the loop to execute again `maxstack` is not empty and `maxstack[-1]` is less than `x`**
