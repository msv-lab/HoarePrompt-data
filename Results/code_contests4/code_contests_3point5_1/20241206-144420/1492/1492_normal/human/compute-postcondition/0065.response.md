According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `maxstack` and the last element of `maxstack` being less than `x`. Right before the loop, `maxstack` contains the new element `x`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `maxstack` needs to be adjusted so that it is not empty or `maxstack[-1]` is greater than or equal to `x`.

State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the previous element plus 1, `maxstack` contains the new element `x` or `maxstack[-1]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `maxidx` contains the index `i`, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` contains the index `i`, `i` is 1, `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty**
