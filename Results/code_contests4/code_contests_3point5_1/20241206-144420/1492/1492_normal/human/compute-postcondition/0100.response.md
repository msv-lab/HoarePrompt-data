Since the loop depends on the condition `minstack and minstack[-1] > x`, it will execute one more time if both `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **All the conditions remain the same for the loop to execute one more time**.
