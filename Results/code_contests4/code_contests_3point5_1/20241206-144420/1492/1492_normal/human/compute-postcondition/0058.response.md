According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `minstack[-1] > x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, and `x` should be such that `minstack[-1] > x` is true for the loop to execute. In addition, `minidx` removes the last element in the list.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `x` needs to be updated to a value where `minstack[-1] > x` is still true.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the previous element plus 1, `maxstack` contains the new element `x`, `maxidx` contains the index `i`, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `x` should be such that `minstack[-1] > x` is true, `minidx` removes the last element in the list, and for the loop to execute again `x` should be updated where `minstack[-1] > x` is still true**.
