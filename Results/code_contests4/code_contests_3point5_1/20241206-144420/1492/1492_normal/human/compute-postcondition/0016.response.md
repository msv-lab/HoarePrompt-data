According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `minstack and minstack[-1] > x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must be satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` contains 0, `minstack` contains the value of `first`, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `dp` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Update `minstack` to have a value and the last element in `minstack` must be greater than `x`.

State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains the value of `first`, `maxidx` contains 0, `minstack` contains the value of `first` and the last element in `minstack` is greater than `x`, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and `dp` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1 for the loop to execute one more time**.
