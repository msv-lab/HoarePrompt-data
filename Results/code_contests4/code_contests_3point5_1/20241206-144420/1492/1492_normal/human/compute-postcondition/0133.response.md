Example Answer:
`x` is appended to `maxstack`, so the element `x` is added to the end of `maxstack`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the specific operations are executed if necessary. Therefore, the Output State is: minstack contains the element `x`, minidx contains the appended value `i`, maxstack contains the appended element `x`, maxidx remains unchanged, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1.
Output State: **minstack contains the element `x`, minidx contains the appended value `i`, maxstack contains the appended element `x`, maxidx remains unchanged, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1**
