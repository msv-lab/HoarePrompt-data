According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `maxstack` and the condition `maxstack[-1] < x`. If `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxstack` does not contain the value that was popped. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `maxstack` needs to contain at least one element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` contains at least one element, `maxidx` is an empty list, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
