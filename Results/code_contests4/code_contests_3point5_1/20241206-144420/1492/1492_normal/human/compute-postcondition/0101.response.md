Example Answer: 
The `pop()` function removes and returns the top element of the `minstack`. Since there is no mention of what happens if the stack is empty, we assume the stack is not empty. After the execution, the top element is removed, and the `minstack` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: minstack is updated after removing the top element.
Output State: **minstack is updated after removing the top element**
