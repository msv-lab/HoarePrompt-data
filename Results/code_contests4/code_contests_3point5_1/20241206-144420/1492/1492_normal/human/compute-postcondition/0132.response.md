Example Answer:
`minidx` appends the value `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: minstack contains the element `x`, minidx contains the appended value `i`, maxstack and maxidx remain unchanged, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1, and the specific operations are executed if necessary.
Output State: **minstack contains the element `x`, minidx contains the appended value `i`, maxstack and maxidx remain unchanged, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1, and specific operations are executed if necessary.**
