Postcondition: ***minstack, minidx, maxstack are empty, maxidx is true, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1. If minstack is not empty and its top element equals x, the function executes a specific operation. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
