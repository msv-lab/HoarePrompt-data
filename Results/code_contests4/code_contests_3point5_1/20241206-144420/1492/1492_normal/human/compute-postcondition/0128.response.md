Output State: **minstack, minidx, maxstack are empty, maxidx is true, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1. If minstack is not empty and its top element equals x, the function executes a specific operation. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state. Additionally, if (maxstack and maxstack[-1] == x) then the top element of maxstack is equal to x.**
