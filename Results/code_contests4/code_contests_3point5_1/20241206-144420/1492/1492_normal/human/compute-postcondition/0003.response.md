Example Answer:
The list `dp` is initialized with `n` number of zeros. The value of `n` is already assigned as an integer input, so the list `dp` will have `n` number of zeros in it. The other variables `ar` and `first` remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n` holds the input value as an integer, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros**
