Example Answer:
After executing `maxidx.pop()`, the top element of `maxidx` is removed. Since `maxstack` was non-empty with the top element less than `x`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the output state is: `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `maxstack` is non-empty with the top element less than `x` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `maxstack` is non-empty with the top element less than `x` for the loop to execute again**
