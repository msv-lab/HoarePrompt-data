According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minstack` and the element at the top of `minstack` denoted by `minstack[-1]`. If `minstack` is not empty and the top element is greater than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` has one less element. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `minstack` should still have elements after removing one, and the top element should still be greater than `x`.
State: **`minstack` has one less element, for the loop to execute again `minstack` is not empty and `minstack[-1]` is greater than `x`**
