According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `maxstack` and the condition `maxstack[-1] < x`. If `maxstack` is not empty and the top element of `maxstack` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, and the loop has finished executing. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to set `maxstack` to be non-empty with the top element less than `x`.
State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, to execute the loop again `maxstack` should be non-empty and the top element of `maxstack` should be less than `x`**
