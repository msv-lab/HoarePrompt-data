Example Answer:
The last element in `maxidx` is removed. Since the loop has finished executing and we are not entering the loop again, the states of `minstack` and `minidx` remain empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, the loop has finished executing.
Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, the loop has finished executing.**
