Example Answer:
`dp[i]` is assigned the minimum value between the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`. Since `minidx` is not empty, `dp[minidx[-1]]` can be accessed, and a comparison is made to determine the minimum value. The loop has finished executing, so no new elements will be added to `minstack`, `minidx`, `maxstack`, or `maxidx`. Therefore, the Output State is: minstack, minidx, maxstack, maxidx are still empty, and the loop has finished executing.
Output State: **minstack, minidx, maxstack, maxidx are empty, the loop has finished executing**
