Example Answer:
The `pop()` function removes the top element of the `maxstack`. Since `maxstack` is non-empty with the top element less than `x`, the loop will execute again. The states of `minstack` and `minidx` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`minstack` is empty, `minidx` is empty, `maxstack` is non-empty with the top element less than `x` for the loop to execute again**
