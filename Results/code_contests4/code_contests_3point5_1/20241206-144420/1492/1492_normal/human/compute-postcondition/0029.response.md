According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x`. If `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` holds the input value
- `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`
- `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`
- `dp` is a list of `n` zeros
- `maxstack` has one less element
- `maxidx` is an empty list
- `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`
- `minidx` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `maxstack` should not be empty
- The last element of `maxstack` should be less than `x`

State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `maxstack` has one less element, `maxidx` is an empty list, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`**
