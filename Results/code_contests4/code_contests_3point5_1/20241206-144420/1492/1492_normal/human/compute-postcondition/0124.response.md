Example Answer:
The last element of minstack is popped out. Since minstack is not empty and the last element is equal to x, the last element equal to x is removed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: minstack, minidx, maxstack, maxidx are empty, and the loop has finished executing. If maxidx is true, then dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1.
Output State: **minstack, minidx, maxstack, maxidx are empty, and the loop has finished executing. If maxidx is true, then dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1**
