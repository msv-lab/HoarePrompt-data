According to the code, the loop can execute if the condition `minstack and minstack[-1] > x` is true. Right before the loop, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar` and a new element `x`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `x` should be such that `minstack[-1] > x` is true.
2. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the previous element plus 1, `maxstack` contains the new element `x`, `maxidx` contains the index `i`, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar` and a new element `x`, `minidx` contains the index `i`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `x` should be such that `minstack[-1] > x` is true**
