Example Answer:
`x` is appended to `minstack`. The states of `minidx`, `maxstack`, `maxidx`, and `dp[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: minstack contains the element `x`, minidx, maxstack, maxidx remain unchanged, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1. If minstack is not empty and its top element equals x, the function executes a specific operation. Additionally, if (maxstack and maxstack[-1] == x), then the top element of maxstack is equal to x.
Output State: **minstack contains the element `x`, minidx, maxstack, maxidx remain unchanged, dp[i] is updated based on the calculation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1. If minstack is not empty and its top element equals x, the function executes a specific operation. Additionally, if (maxstack and maxstack[-1] == x), then the top element of maxstack is equal to x.**
