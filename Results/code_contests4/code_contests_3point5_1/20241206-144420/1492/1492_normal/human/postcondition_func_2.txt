The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and reads a list of integers from input. It then converts each element in the list to an integer, adds `o` to each element, and returns a new list containing the sum of the elements. The function does not handle any errors that may occur during input reading or conversion, and it assumes the input list is valid.
