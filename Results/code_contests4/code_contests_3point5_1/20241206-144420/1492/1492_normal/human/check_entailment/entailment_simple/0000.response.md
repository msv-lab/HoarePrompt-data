Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimal amount of discrete jumps required for Vasya to reach the last skyscraper. It follows the problem description by implementing the logic to determine the minimum number of jumps based on the height constraints between skyscrapers. The program uses dynamic programming and stack data structures to efficiently calculate the minimum jumps required.

The conditions for discrete jumps are correctly implemented in the program, ensuring that Vasya can reach the last skyscraper with the minimal number of jumps. The use of stacks to keep track of the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far ensures that the program considers all possible jump scenarios.

Overall, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
