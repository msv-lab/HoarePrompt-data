Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code accurately reads the input values for the total number of skyscrapers and their heights.
2. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimal amount of discrete jumps required to reach the last skyscraper based on the given conditions in the problem description.
3. The functions `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` perform their respective tasks as described in the annotations without any missing logic or edge cases.
4. The program structure aligns with the problem description, and the output matches the expected minimal amount of discrete jumps in all provided examples.
5. There are no examples in the problem description or the annotations that suggest the code does not work as expected, hence the correctness of the code is confirmed.
