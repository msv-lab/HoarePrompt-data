After reviewing the code and the provided problem description, as well as the output hints, I believe the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimum number of discrete jumps required to reach the last skyscraper. It utilizes dynamic programming and two stacks to keep track of the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far. The function iterates through the skyscraper heights, updating the minimum number of jumps required at each step. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description as it considers the conditions for a jump to be discrete.

The `func_2` function correctly reads the input heights of the skyscrapers and forms a list of heights.

Overall, the code seems to cover all potential cases outlined in the problem description, and the logic of the code is in agreement with the requirements specified.
