You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the i-th one is h_i. Today some villains have set on fire first n - 1 of them, and now the only safety building is n-th skyscraper.

Let's call a jump from i-th skyscraper to j-th (i < j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i < j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 

  * i + 1 = j 
  * max(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}) < min(h_i, h_j) 
  * max(h_i, h_j) < min(h_{i + 1}, …, h_{j - 1}). 



At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach n-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — total amount of skyscrapers.

The second line contains n integers h_1, h_2, …, h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) — heights of skyscrapers.

Output

Print single number k — minimal amount of discrete jumps. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first testcase, Vasya can jump in the following way: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5.

In the second and third testcases, we can reach last skyscraper in one jump.

Sequence of jumps in the fourth testcase: 1 → 3 → 5.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    ar = func_2()
    first = ar[0]
    dp = [0] * n
    maxstack = [first]
    maxidx = [0]
    minstack = [first]
    minidx = [0]
    for (i, x) in enumerate(ar):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
        
        while minstack and minstack[-1] > x:
            minstack.pop()
            minidx.pop()
        
        while maxstack and maxstack[-1] < x:
            maxstack.pop()
            maxidx.pop()
        
        if minidx:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[minidx[-1]] + 1)
        
        if maxidx:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1)
        
        if minstack and minstack[-1] == x:
            minstack.pop()
            minidx.pop()
        
        if maxstack and maxstack[-1] == x:
            maxstack.pop()
            maxidx.pop()
        
        minstack.append(x)
        
        minidx.append(i)
        
        maxstack.append(x)
        
        maxidx.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` holds the input value, `ar` is assigned the result of `func_2()`, `first` is assigned the first element of `ar`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the minimum number of moves to reach the element at index `i`, `maxstack` is empty, `maxidx` is empty, `minstack` contains the minimum value element from `ar`, `minidx` contains the index of the minimum value element in `ar`
    debug_print(dp)
    print(dp[n - 1])

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5. The list h contains n integers where each integer represents the height of a skyscraper, and each height value is between 1 and 10^9.**
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the height of a skyscraper

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5. h_i are integers such that 1 <= h_i <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= n.**
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the corresponding element in the input list after converting it to an integer and adding 'o'

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5. m is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= h_i <= 10^9.**
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n elements, where each element is the result of calling func_2()

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- h_i (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^9) are integers representing the heights of the skyscrapers.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values obtained by calling function func_5 with arguments *dim[1:] for each element in the range of dim[0]. If dim is empty, it returns the result of calling function f().


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
