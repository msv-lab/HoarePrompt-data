Explanation: 
- The code takes the input from standard input and processes it to calculate the minimum possible sadness of Snuke as described in the problem. 
- It iterates through each line of input, calculates the difference between the elements of the input sequence and the corresponding indexes, sorts these differences, and then calculates the minimum sadness based on these differences.
- The code correctly follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all the provided examples.
- There are no edge cases identified where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description and the given examples.
