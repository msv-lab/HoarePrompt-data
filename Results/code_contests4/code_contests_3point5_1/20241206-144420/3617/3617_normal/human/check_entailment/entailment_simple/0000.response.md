Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input correctly, calculates the difference between each element of the array `A` and their respective index + 1, sorts these differences, and then calculates the minimum sadness value for Snuke by iterating through the differences and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between the current element and all other elements in the list. It then prints the minimum sadness value.

This approach follows the problem description accurately and calculates the minimum possible sadness of Snuke as required. The program handles all possible cases and correctly finds the minimum sadness value.
