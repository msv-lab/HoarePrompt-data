Example Answer:
The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Since `j` is 1 and `i` is at least 0, the calculation will be based on the values of `diff[1]` and `diff[0]`. After the calculation, `left` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` has been updated, `j` is 1, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and each element in `diff` before it, `m` contains the result of `left + right`.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` has been updated, `j` is 1, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and each element in `diff` before it, `m` contains the result of `left + right**.
