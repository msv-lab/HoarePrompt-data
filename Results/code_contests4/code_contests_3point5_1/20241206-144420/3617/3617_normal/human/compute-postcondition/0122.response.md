Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A`, `N` is greater than `i`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[i]` and all other elements in `diff`, `m` contains the sum of `left` and `right` for each iteration of the loop**
