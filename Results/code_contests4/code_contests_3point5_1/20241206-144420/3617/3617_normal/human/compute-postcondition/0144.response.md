According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is greater than 0, `j` is `N+1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `N`, which means `j` should be less than `N+1`. Therefore, the next iteration requires adjusting the state as follows:
State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between elements in `diff`, `right` is the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` is a list with at least one element, `j` is `N`, `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
