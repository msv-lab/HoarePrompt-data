Example Answer:
The value of `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all elements in `diff` up to index `i`, and `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between elements at indices `i` and `N - 1`. After the loop finishes executing, `m` retains its initial value and `m` appends the sum of `left` and `right`. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all elements in `diff` up to index `i`, `line`, `N`, `A`, `diff`, `i`, `j` is `N - 1`, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between elements at indices `i` and `N - 1`, `m` retains its initial value, `m` appends the sum of `left` and `right`.
Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all elements in `diff` up to index `i`, `line`, `N`, `A`, `diff`, `i`, `j` is `N - 1`, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between elements at indices `i` and `N - 1`, `m` retains its initial value, `m` appends the sum of `left` and `right`**
