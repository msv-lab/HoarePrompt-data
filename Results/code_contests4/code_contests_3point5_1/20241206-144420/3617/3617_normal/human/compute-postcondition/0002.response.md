Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value converted from the input `line`. The value of `line` is a non-empty string containing the input line without newline characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string containing the input line without newline characters; `N` is an integer value.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string containing the input line without newline characters; `N` is an integer value**
