Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is N, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j from 0 to N-1, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` and `j` are recalculated based on the updated `diff`, for the loop to execute `i` is less than `N`, `left` is recalculated, `m` and `j` are recalculated, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
