Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A`, `N` is the new input integer, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[i]` and all other elements in `diff`, `m` contains the sum of `left` and `right` for each iteration of the loop, and the minimum value in `m` is printed, for the loop to execute again new input needs to be provided in `line`, `A` is a list of integers.**
