Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is `N`, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid `j` values, `m` is a list with at least one element, a new value is appended to `m` which is the sum of `left` and `right` for the loop to execute one more time**
