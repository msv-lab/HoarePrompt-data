Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated based on the calculation `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `right` is recalculated based on the updated `diff` list, `m` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is at least 1**
