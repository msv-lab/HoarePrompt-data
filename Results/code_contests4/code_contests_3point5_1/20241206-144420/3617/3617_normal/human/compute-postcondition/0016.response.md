According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `N`. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of elements in `diff`, `j` is `i`, `right` is 0, for the loop to execute `j` should be in the range `(i + 1, N)`**
