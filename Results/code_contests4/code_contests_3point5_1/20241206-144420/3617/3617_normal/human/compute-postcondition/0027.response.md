Example Answer:
`left` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `j` and `i` are unknown, so the exact value of the increment cannot be determined. However, `left` will increase by the absolute difference between two elements in the `diff` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` has been updated, `j` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and each element in `diff` before it, `m` contains the result of `left + right`.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` has been updated, `j` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and each element in `diff` before it, `m` contains the result of `left + right`**
