According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the total number of elements in `A` plus 1 and `N` is greater than `i+1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
State: **Output State: `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A` plus 1, `N` is greater than i+1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between elements in `diff`, `j` is i+2, `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` is the sum of `left` and the updated `right`**.
