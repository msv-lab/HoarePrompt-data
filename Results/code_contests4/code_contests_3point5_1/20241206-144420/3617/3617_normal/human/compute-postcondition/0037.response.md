Example Answer: 
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are obtained from the `diff` list. The previous values of `right`, `diff[j]`, and `diff[i]` are not specified, so the output state is: `line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` is updated according to the calculations in the loop, `j` is `i + 2`, `right` is updated according to the calculations in the loop, `m` contains the result of `left + right`.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` is updated according to the calculations in the loop, `j` is `i + 2`, `right` is updated according to the calculations in the loop, `m` contains the result of `left + right`**
