Example Answer:
The list `m` appends the sum of `left` and `right`. The values of `diff`, `i`, `N`, `left`, `j`, and `right` are used in the calculation. After execution, the list `m` will have the updated value with `left + right` appended to it. 
Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A`, `N` is greater than i+1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `j` is N-1, `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`**
