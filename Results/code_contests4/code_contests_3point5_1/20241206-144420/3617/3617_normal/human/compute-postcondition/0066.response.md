Example Answer:
The list comprehension subtracts each element `a` in the list `A` by its index `i` incremented by 1, then sorts the resulting values in ascending order and assigns it to `diff`. The previous values of `A` and `N` are unknown. 
Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1**
