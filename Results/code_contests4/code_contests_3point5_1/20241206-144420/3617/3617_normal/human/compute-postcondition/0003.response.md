Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list `A` by converting each element of the input line `line` into an integer and splitting the line by spaces. The `rstrip('\n')` is used to remove any trailing newline characters from the input line. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string containing the input line without newline characters; `N` is an integer value; `A` is a list of integers created from the input line.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string containing the input line without newline characters; `N` is an integer value; `A` is a list of integers created from the input line**
