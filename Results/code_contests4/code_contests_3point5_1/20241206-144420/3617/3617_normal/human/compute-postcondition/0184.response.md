Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid `j` values, `m` is a list of length N with each element being the sum of `left` and `right` for the respective iteration of the loop.**
