Example Answer:
The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[2]` and `diff[i]`, where `i` is less than `N`. The `left` value will change based on the values of `diff[2]` and `diff[i]`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: line is a non-empty string, N is greater than 0, A is a list of integers created from the input line, diff is a sorted list of differences, i is less than N, left is updated by adding the absolute difference between diff[2] and diff[i], j is 2.
Output State: **line is a non-empty string, N is greater than 0, A is a list of integers created from the input line, diff is a sorted list of differences, i is less than N, left is updated by adding the absolute difference between diff[2] and diff[i], j is 2**
