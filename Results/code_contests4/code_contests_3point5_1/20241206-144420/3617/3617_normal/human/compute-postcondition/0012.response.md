According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as j is less than i. At the end of the last iteration, line is a non-empty string, N is greater than 0, A is a list of integers created from the input line, diff is a sorted list of differences, i is less than N, left is updated by adding the absolute difference between diff[1] and diff[i], j is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **line is a non-empty string, N is greater than 0, A is a list of integers created from the input line, diff is a sorted list of differences, i is less than N, left is updated by adding the absolute difference between diff[1] and diff[i], j is 2**
