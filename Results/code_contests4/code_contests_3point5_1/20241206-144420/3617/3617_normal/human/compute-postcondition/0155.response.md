Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is `N - 3`, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated to include the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid `j` values, `right` remains unchanged, `m` has a new value appended which is the sum of `left` and `right` for the next iteration of the loop**
