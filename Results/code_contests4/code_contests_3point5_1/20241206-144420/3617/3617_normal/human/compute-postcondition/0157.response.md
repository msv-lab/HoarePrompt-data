Output State: **Output State: `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid `j` values, `right` is now 0, `m` is a list with N elements where each element is the sum of `left` and `right` for the respective iteration of the loop.**
