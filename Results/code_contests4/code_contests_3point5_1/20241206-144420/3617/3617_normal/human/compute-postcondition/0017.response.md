Example Answer:
The variable `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The loop iterates for `j` in the range `(i + 1, N)`, and `left` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of elements in `diff`. The initial state of other variables remains the same. 
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of elements in `diff`, `j` is `i`, `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.**
