Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is N, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j from 0 to N-1, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j from i+1 to N-1, `m` and `j` are recalculated based on the updated `diff`**
