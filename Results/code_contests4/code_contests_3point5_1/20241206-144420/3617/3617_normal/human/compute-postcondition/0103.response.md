Example Answer:
After executing the provided code snippet, the value of `m` is updated by appending the sum of `left` and `right`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A` plus 1, `N` is greater than i+1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between elements in `diff`, `j` is N, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[i+1]` and `diff[N-1]`, `m` is the sum of `left` and `right`.
Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A` plus 1, `N` is greater than i+1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between elements in `diff`, `j` is N, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[i+1]` and `diff[N-1]`, `m` is the sum of `left` and `right`.**
