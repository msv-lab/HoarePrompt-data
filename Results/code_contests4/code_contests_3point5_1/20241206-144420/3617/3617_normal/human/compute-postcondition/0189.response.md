Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input, processes the input data to calculate a minimum value based on given conditions, and prints this minimum value. The function iterates through each line of input until the input line is empty. It performs various calculations involving the input data to determine the minimum value, updating multiple variables in the process. The function does not specify a return value in the given information, and the functionality provided by the annotations may not fully align with the actual code execution. It is crucial to note that the code processes input data to calculate a minimum value, and the exact behavior may differ from what the annotations describe.**
