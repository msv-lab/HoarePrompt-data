Example Answer: 
`right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The value of `j` should be `i + 2`, and less than `N` for the loop to execute again. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all elements in `diff` up to index `i`, `line`, `N`, `A`, `diff`, `i`, `j` is `i + 2`, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between elements at indices `i` and `j`, `m` retains its initial value, for the loop to execute again `j` should be `i + 2` and less than `N**
