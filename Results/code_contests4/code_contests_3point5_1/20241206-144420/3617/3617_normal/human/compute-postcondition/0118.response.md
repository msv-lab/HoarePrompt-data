According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is i+1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it i+2.
State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A`, `N` is greater than `i`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range from 0 to i-1, `j` is i+2, `right` is updated with the sum of the previous right value and the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` is the sum of `left` and updated `right`, for the loop to execute `j` is i+3**
