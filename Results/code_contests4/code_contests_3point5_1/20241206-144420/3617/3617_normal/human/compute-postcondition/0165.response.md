Output State: `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is N-1, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid `j` values, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid `j` values, `m` is a list with N elements where each element is the sum of `left` and `right` for the respective iteration of the loop, `right` contains the sum of absolute differences between the last element of `diff` and all other elements of `diff`, loop does not execute if `N` is less than or equal to 1, `m` appends the sum of `left` and `right`.
