According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be updated to 1.
State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[1]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is 1**
