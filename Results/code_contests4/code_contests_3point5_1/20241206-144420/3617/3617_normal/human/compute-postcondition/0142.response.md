According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is greater than 0, `j` is `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `N`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1. 
State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is `N-1`, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between elements in `diff`, `right` is the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` is a list with at least one element, `j` is `N+1` for the loop to execute one more time**
