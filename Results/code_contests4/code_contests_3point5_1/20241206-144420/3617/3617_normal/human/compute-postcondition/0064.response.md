Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of `int(line)`. The value of `line` is unknown, so the value of `N` will be determined by the input provided for `line`. Therefore, the Output State is: No variables need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, `N` is an integer based on the input provided for `line`.
Output State: **No variables need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, `N` is an integer based on the input provided for `line`**
