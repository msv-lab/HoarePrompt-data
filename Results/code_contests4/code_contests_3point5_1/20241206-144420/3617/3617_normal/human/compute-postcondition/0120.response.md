Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A`, `N` is greater than `i`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range from 0 to i-1, `j` is N-1, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range from i+1 to N-1, `m` is the sum of `left` and `right`.**
