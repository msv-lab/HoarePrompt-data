Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. This calculation is performed for each iteration of the loop until `j` becomes equal to `N`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, `left` contains the sum of absolute differences between all elements in `diff` up to index `i`, `line`, `N`, `A`, `diff`, `i`, `j` is `i + 1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between elements at indices `i` and `j`, `m` retains its initial value, for the loop to execute again `j` should be `i + 2` and less than `N.
