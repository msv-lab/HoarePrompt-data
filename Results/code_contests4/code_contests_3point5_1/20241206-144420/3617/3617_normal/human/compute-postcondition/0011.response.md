Example Answer:
`left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[1]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `diff`, `i`, and `j` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[1]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[1]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is 1**
