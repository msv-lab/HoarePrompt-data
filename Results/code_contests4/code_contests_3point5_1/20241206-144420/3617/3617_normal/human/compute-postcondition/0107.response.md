Output State: `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A` plus 1, `N` is greater than i+1, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[i+1]` and `diff[N-1]`, `m` is the sum of `left` and `right`, for the loop to execute `i` is greater than 0.
