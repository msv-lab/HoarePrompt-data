According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is at least 1, `j` is `N-1`, `left` is updated, `right` remains the same, `m` contains the result of `left + right` with the new appended value. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` should be less than `i+1`.
State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than `i+1`, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 1, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is `N-1`, `right` remains the same, `m` contains the result of `left + right` with the new appended value, for the loop to execute `j` is in range from 0 to `i+1**`.
