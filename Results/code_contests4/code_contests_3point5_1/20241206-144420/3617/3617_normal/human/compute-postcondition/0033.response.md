Example Answer:
The variable `right` is assigned the value 0. This means that the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and each element in `diff` before it is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` is updated according to the calculations in the loop, `j` is `i-1`, `right` is 0, `m` contains the result of `left + right`.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` is updated according to the calculations in the loop, `j` is `i-1`, `right` is 0, `m` contains the result of `left + right`**
