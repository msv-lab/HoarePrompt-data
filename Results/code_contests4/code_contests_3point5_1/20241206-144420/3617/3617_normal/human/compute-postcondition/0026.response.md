According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is at least 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` is 0, `j` is 0, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and each element in `diff` before it, `m` contains the result of `left + right`**
