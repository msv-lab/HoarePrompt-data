Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The variable `i` is less than `N` and `j` is `i + 1`, so the calculation is based on the current values of `i` and `j`. The list `diff` is sorted, and `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, but they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of elements in `diff`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.
Output State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is less than `N`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of elements in `diff`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]**.
