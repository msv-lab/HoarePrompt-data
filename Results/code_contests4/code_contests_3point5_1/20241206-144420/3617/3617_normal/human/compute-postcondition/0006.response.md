According to the code, the loop can execute as long as N is greater than 0. The state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted so that N is greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`line` is a non-empty string containing the input line without newline characters; `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line; `diff` is a sorted list of the differences between each element in `A` and its index + 1; `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
