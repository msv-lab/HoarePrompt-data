Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is the total number of elements in `A` plus 1, `N` is greater than i+1, `left` is 0, `j` is N-1, `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for the next iteration, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and the updated `right` for the next iteration**
