Example Answer:
The value of `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous values of `right`, `diff[j]`, and `diff[i]` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is N, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is recalculated, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` and `j` are recalculated based on the updated `diff`, for the loop to execute `i` is less than `N`.
Output State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is N, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is recalculated, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` and `j` are recalculated based on the updated `diff`, for the loop to execute `i` is less than `N`**
