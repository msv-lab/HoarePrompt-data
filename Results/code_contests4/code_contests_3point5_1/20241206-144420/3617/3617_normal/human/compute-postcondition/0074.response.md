According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `diff` is a sorted list, `i` is greater than 0, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`diff` is a sorted list of differences between elements in `A` and their respective indices incremented by 1, `i` is greater than 0, `N` is greater than 0, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is 2**
