According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `line`. If `line` has a truthy value, the loop can execute again. Since no variables are affected in terms of minimum value contained in the variable `m` at the end of the previous iteration, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **No variables need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again**
