According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is at least 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`line` is a non-empty string, `N` is greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers created from the input line, `diff` is a sorted list of differences, `i` is at least 0, `left` has been updated, `j` is 1, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and each element in `diff` before it, `m` contains the result of `left + right`**
