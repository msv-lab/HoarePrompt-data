Correctness: False

Explanation: 
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible sadness of Snuke as described in the problem statement. The logic used in the program to calculate the sadness is incorrect. The calculation of "left" and "right" in the nested loop is not consistent with the actual calculation required to find the minimum possible sadness.

For example, consider the input:
6
6 5 4 3 2 1

The expected output should be 18, but the program does not produce the correct output for this input. The program fails to handle this case as it does not correctly calculate the minimum possible sadness.
