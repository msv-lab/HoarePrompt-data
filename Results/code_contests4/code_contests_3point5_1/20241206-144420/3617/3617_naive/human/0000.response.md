Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input integer sequence A, calculates the difference between each element of A and (i+1) where i is the index of the element, and then finds the minimum possible sadness of Snuke by calculating the sum of absolute differences between the differences calculated. The program iterates through all possible values of b to find the minimum sadness. The logic seems correct and the program follows the problem description for all potential cases. The implementation of finding the minimum sadness based on the differences is correct.
