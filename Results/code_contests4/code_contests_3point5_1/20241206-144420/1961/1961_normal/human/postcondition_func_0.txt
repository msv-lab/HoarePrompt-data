The function func_1 accepts a parameter s, which is expected to be a list of integers containing elements n, m, k, and an array a with positive integer values. The function then writes the string representation of s to the standard output. The function does not have any explicit return value. The provided precondition specifies the constraints for the input parameters, ensuring they meet specific criteria before the function is called.
