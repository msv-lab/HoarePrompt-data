#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter s, which is expected to be a list of integers containing elements n, m, k, and an array a with positive integer values. The function then writes the string representation of s to the standard output. The function does not have any explicit return value. The provided precondition specifies the constraints for the input parameters, ensuring they meet specific criteria before the function is called.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array.
  - `m` is a positive integer representing your position in the line.
  - `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of people whose choices you can fix.
  - The array `a` contains `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a tuple `s` containing test cases. Each test case consists of parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and an array `a` as described in the annotations. The function then writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output followed by a newline character. There is no specific return value mentioned in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) and a list of n positive integers representing the elements of the array.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns an integer after reading and stripping the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads and processes input for multiple test cases, then returns an integer. However, the code snippet is incomplete as it lacks the necessary logic to handle the input format specified in the annotation (multiple test cases with specific constraints). It only reads an integer and returns it, which is not aligned with the initial description of processing test cases with specific integer inputs. Therefore, the current code does not fully represent the intended functionality described in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers after converting the input values to integers and splitting them
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to convert input values to integers, split them, and return a list of integers. The function reads a line of input and splits it into individual values, converting them to integers before returning a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9.**
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings generated by splitting the input obtained from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `debug` is true, then the program state includes the presence of debug mode.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. If the `debug` mode is true, it prints the arguments passed to it. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 3500, 0 <= k <= n - 1. A is a list of n positive integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**

    return ans
    #The program returns the updated minimum value of the maximum values of segments of matrix A after the loop iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. It iterates through `prilist` and performs calculations based on specific conditions, potentially returning the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of recursive function calls. After the loop, it calculates the minimum value of the maximum values of segments of matrix `A` and returns this value. The function handles various cases, such as updating `ans` based on conditions and breaking out of the loop when necessary.
