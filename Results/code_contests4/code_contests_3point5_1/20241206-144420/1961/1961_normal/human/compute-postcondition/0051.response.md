Postcondition: ***`ans` is initialized to 10000000000.0, `i` is `l`, and for the loop to execute the first time `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. If `i + seglen - 1` is greater than `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. No changes occur if the else part is executed.***
