Functionality: **The function `func_8` takes parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. It iterates through `prilist` and performs calculations based on specific conditions, potentially returning the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of recursive function calls. After the loop, it calculates the minimum value of the maximum values of segments of matrix `A` and returns this value. The function handles various cases, such as updating `ans` based on conditions and breaking out of the loop when necessary.**
