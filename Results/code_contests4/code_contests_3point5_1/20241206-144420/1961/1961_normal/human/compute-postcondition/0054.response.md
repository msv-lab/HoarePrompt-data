Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated to a new value based on the comparison with elements from `A`, `l` is adjusted, `r` is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
