Postcondition: ***`v`, `pl`, `pr`, `lcut`, `rcut` remain unchanged. `lcut` is reassigned the maximum value between 0 and `pl - l + 1`. `rcut` is reassigned the maximum value between 0 and `r - pr + 1`. If `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, then `lcut` is updated to the maximum value between 0 and `pl - l + 1`, and `rcut` is updated to the maximum value between 0 and `r - pr + 1`. `ans` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and the result of the function `func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`. The if statement checks if `rcut` is less than or equal to `k` and `pr - l` is greater than or equal to `seglen`. If this condition holds true, the postcondition remains as described above. No changes occur if the condition is not met.***
