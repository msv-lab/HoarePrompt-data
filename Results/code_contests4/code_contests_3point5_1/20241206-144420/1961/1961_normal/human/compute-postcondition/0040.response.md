Postcondition: ***`v`, `pl`, `pr`, `lcut`, `rcut` are updated. `v`, `pl`, `pr` are updated from `prilist[pi]`. `lcut` is updated. `rcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `r - pr + 1`. `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the result of the function call if `lcut` is less than or equal to `k` and `r - pl` is greater than or equal to `seglen`.***
