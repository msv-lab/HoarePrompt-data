Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop, so it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `v`, `pl`, `pr` are updated from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is updated, `rcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `r - pr + 1`, `ans` may or may not be updated.
Output State: **`v`, `pl`, `pr` are updated from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is updated, `rcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `r - pr + 1`, `ans` may or may not be updated**
