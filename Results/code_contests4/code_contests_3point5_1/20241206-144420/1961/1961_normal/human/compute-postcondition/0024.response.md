Output State: **`v`, `pl`, `pr`, `lcut`, `rcut` remain unchanged. `lcut` is reassigned the maximum value between 0 and `pl - l + 1`. `rcut` is reassigned the maximum value between 0 and `r - pr + 1`. If `lcut` is 0 or `rcut` is 0, then `lcut` is updated to the maximum value between 0 and `pl - l + 1`, and `rcut` is updated to the maximum value between 0 and `r - pr + 1`. `ans` is assigned the value 0.**
