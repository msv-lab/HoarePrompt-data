Example Answer: 
`lcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `pl - l + 1`. The values of `v`, `pl`, `pr`, `prilist[pi]`, `ans`, and `rcut` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `v`, `pl`, `pr` are updated from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is updated, `rcut` remains unchanged, `ans` may or may not be updated.
Output State: **`v`, `pl`, `pr` are updated from `prilist[pi]`, `lcut` is updated, `rcut` remains unchanged, `ans` may or may not be updated**
