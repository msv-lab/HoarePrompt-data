Example Answer:
`v`, `pl`, `pr` are reassigned the values from `prilist[pi]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and increments `pi` by 1. 
Output State: **`v`, `pl`, `pr` are updated from `prilist[pi]`. `lcut`, `rcut` remain unchanged. `ans` may or may not be updated based on the conditions.**
