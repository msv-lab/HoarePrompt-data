According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` is initialized to 10000000000.0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `r` is greater than or equal to `l` and `i` is now `l`.
State: **`ans` is initialized to 10000000000.0, `i` is `l`, for the loop to execute the first time `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**
