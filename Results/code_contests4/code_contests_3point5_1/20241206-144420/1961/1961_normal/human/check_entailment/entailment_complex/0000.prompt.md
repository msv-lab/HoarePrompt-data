You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your n - 1 friends have found an array of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You have decided to share it in the following way: All n of you stand in a line in a particular order. Each minute, the person at the front of the line chooses either the first or the last element of the array, removes it, and keeps it for himself. He then gets out of line, and the next person in line continues the process.

You are standing in the m-th position in the line. Before the process starts, you may choose up to k different people in the line, and persuade them to always take either the first or the last element in the array on their turn (for each person his own choice, not necessarily equal for all people), no matter what the elements themselves are. Once the process starts, you cannot persuade any more people, and you cannot change the choices for the people you already persuaded.

Suppose that you're doing your choices optimally. What is the greatest integer x such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be greater than or equal to x?

Please note that the friends you don't control may do their choice arbitrarily, and they will not necessarily take the biggest element available.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of elements in the array, your position in line and the number of people whose choices you can fix.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.

Output

For each test case, print the largest integer x such that you can guarantee to obtain at least x.

Note

In the first test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the last element and the second person to take the first element.

  * the first person will take the last element (5) because he or she was forced by you to take the last element. After this turn the remaining array will be [2, 9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * the second person will take the first element (2) because he or she was forced by you to take the first element. After this turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * if the third person will choose to take the first element (9), at your turn the remaining array will be [2, 3, 8] and you will take 8 (the last element); 
  * if the third person will choose to take the last element (8), at your turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3] and you will take 9 (the first element). 



Thus, this strategy guarantees to end up with at least 8. We can prove that there is no strategy that guarantees to end up with at least 9. Hence, the answer is 8.

In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the first element. Then, in the worst case, both the second and the third person will take the first element: you will end up with 4.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter s, which is expected to be a list of integers containing elements n, m, k, and an array a with positive integer values. The function then writes the string representation of s to the standard output. The function does not have any explicit return value. The provided precondition specifies the constraints for the input parameters, ensuring they meet specific criteria before the function is called.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array.
  - `m` is a positive integer representing your position in the line.
  - `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of people whose choices you can fix.
  - The array `a` contains `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a tuple `s` containing test cases. Each test case consists of parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and an array `a` as described in the annotations. The function then writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output followed by a newline character. There is no specific return value mentioned in the annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) and a list of n positive integers representing the elements of the array.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns an integer after reading and stripping the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads and processes input for multiple test cases, then returns an integer. However, the code snippet is incomplete as it lacks the necessary logic to handle the input format specified in the annotation (multiple test cases with specific constraints). It only reads an integer and returns it, which is not aligned with the initial description of processing test cases with specific integer inputs. Therefore, the current code does not fully represent the intended functionality described in the annotations.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a list of integers after converting the input values to integers and splitting them
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to convert input values to integers, split them, and return a list of integers. The function reads a line of input and splits it into individual values, converting them to integers before returning a list of these integers.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9.**
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings generated by splitting the input obtained from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `debug` is true, then the program state includes the presence of debug mode.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. If the `debug` mode is true, it prints the arguments passed to it. The function does not return any value.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 3500, 0 <= k <= n - 1. A is a list of n positive integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**

    for pi in xrange(pri_idx, len(prilist) - 1):
        v, pl, pr = prilist[pi]
        
        lcut = max(0, pl - l + 1)
        
        rcut = max(0, r - pr + 1)
        
        if lcut == 0 or rcut == 0:
            continue
        
        ans = 0
        
        if lcut <= k and r - pl >= seglen:
            ans = max(ans, func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))
        
        if rcut <= k and pr - l >= seglen:
            ans = max(ans, func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))

        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, the final output will be the updated values of 'v', 'pl', 'pr', 'lcut', 'rcut', 'ans' based on the conditions and function calls within the loop. The loop will either return the final value of 'ans' after meeting the specified conditions or break out of the loop without any changes to the variables.
    ans = 10000000000.0
    for i in xrange(l, r + 1):
        if i + seglen - 1 > r:
            break
        
        ans = min(ans, max(A[i], A[i + seglen - 1]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is updated to the minimum of the maximum values of segments of `A` based on the comparisons made in each iteration of the loop.
    return ans
    #The program returns the updated minimum value of the maximum values of segments of matrix A after the loop iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. It iterates through `prilist` and performs calculations based on specific conditions, potentially returning the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of recursive function calls. After the loop, it calculates the minimum value of the maximum values of segments of matrix `A` and returns this value. The function handles various cases, such as updating `ans` based on conditions and breaking out of the loop when necessary.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
