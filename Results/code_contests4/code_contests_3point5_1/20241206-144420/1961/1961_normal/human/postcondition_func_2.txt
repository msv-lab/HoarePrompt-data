The function reads and processes input for multiple test cases, then returns an integer. However, the code snippet is incomplete as it lacks the necessary logic to handle the input format specified in the annotation (multiple test cases with specific constraints). It only reads an integer and returns it, which is not aligned with the initial description of processing test cases with specific integer inputs. Therefore, the current code does not fully represent the intended functionality described in the annotations.
