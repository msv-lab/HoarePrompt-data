The function `func_2` accepts a tuple `s` containing test cases. Each test case consists of parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and an array `a` as described in the annotations. The function then writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output followed by a newline character. There is no specific return value mentioned in the annotations.
