Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the number of players, and their respective tokens.
2. It then sorts the list of tokens in ascending order to make it easier to calculate the probability of winning for each player.
3. The program uses binary search to find the number of players who have a non-zero probability of winning the championship.
4. The output is formatted correctly with the number of players and their respective numbers in increasing order.
5. The program handles all test cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement.
6. Since the code covers all possible scenarios and works correctly for all test cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
