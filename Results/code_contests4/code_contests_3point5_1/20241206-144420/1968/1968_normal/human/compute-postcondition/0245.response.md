Example Answer:
`su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `be`, `en`, `ans`, `i`, `su`, `md` are adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.
Output State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `i`, `su`, `md` are adjusted accordingly for the next iteration**
