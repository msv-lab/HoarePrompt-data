Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 1`, for the loop to execute. The sum of elements from index 0 to `md` of list `a` is less than the element at index `i`**
