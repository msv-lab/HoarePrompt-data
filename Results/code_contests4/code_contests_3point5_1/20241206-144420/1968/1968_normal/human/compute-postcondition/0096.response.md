According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `be` needs to be adjusted to less than or equal to `en`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, for the loop to execute the first time `be` needs to be less than or equal to `en`**
