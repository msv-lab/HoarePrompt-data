According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `md + 1` is less than `n`, which implies `md` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the states so that `md` is less than `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is any value less than or equal to `en`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is n, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1` for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `md + 1` and less than `n`**
