Example Answer:
The value of `su` is reassigned to -1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is less than the element at index `i` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than `md + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 1`, `su` is less than the element at index `i` in list `a`**
