Example Answer:
The value of `su` is assigned to -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `be`, `en`, `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `su` is -1, `md` adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.
Output State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `su` is -1, `md` adjusted accordingly for the next iteration**
