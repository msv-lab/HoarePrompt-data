According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `i` is defined as `md + 1` and `n`, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than `md + 1`. Before the loop starts, `be` should be less than or equal to `en`, and `su` should be the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`.
State: **`n` is greater than `md + 1`, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`**
