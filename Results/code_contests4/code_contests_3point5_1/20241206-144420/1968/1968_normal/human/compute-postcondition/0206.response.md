According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `su` are provided as integers. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `su` is less than any element in list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1`, then `su` should be set to -1 and the loop should break.
2. If `su` is not less than any element in list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1`, then:
   - `be` should be assigned the value of `md + 1`.
   - `en` should be set to `md - 1`.
   - `ans` should be set to `md + 1`.
   - `su` should contain the sum of elements in list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1`.

State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time**.
