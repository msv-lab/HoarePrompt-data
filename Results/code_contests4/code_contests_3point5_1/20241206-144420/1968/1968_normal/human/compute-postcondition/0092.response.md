The code snippet appends a string representation of a range of values to the list `out`. The range starts from the value of `ans` and goes up to `n + 1`. The values in the range are converted to strings and then joined with spaces.

Example Answer: 
The range of values appended to `out` starts from the index `ans` and goes up to `n + 1`. The values are converted to strings and joined by spaces. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is the index where the sum `su` is less than an element in `a`, `en` is the index where the sum `su` is greater than or equal to elements in `a`, `ans` is the index where the sum `su` is equal to the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `ans`, `md` is the index used for binary search, `su` is either the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `n - 1` if no element violated the sum condition, or -1 if at least one element violated the condition during the loop execution, `out` has appended the value `n - ans + 1`, a range of values from `ans` to `n + 1` converted to strings and joined by spaces.**
