Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is the index where the sum `su` is less than an element in `a`, `en` is the index where the sum `su` is greater than or equal to elements in `a`, `ans` is the index where the sum `su` is equal to the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `ans`, `md` is the index used for binary search, `su` is either the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `n - 1` if no element violated the sum condition, or -1 if at least one element violated the condition during the loop execution.**
