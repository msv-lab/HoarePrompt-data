According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, and `ans` is n. In order for the loop to execute the first time, `be` needs to be less than or equal to `en`. Therefore, `en` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `be`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`be` is 0, `en` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is n**
