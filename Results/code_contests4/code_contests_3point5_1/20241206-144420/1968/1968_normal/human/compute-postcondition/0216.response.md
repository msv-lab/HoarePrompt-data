Example Answer: 
`su` is assigned the value -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` are adjusted accordingly, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time; `su` is -1.
Output State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` are adjusted accordingly, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time; `su` is -1**
