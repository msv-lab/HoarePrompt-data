According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `be` and `en` are such that the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`, `be` and `en` are adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute one more time**
