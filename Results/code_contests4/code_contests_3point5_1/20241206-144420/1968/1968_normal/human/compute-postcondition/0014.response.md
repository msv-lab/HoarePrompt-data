Example Answer:
`md` is calculated as `(be + en) // 2`, where `be` is any value less than or equal to `en` and `en` is `n - 1`. The sum of the elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1` is assigned to `su`. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, and `md` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is any value less than or equal to `en`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is n, `md` is the result of `(be + en) // 2`, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is any value less than or equal to `en`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is n, `md` is the result of `(be + en) // 2`, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`**
