Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, `su` is either -1 or the sum of element at index `i` of list `a`, `i` is `md + 2` for the loop to execute one more time, and `n` is incremented by 1. If `su` is less than the element at index `i` of list `a`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
