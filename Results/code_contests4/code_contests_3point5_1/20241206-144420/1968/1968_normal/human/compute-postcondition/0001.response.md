Example Answer:
`rstrs` is assigned a lambda function that converts each element read from stdin into a string and creates a list of those strings. The lambda function `rstr` is not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list**
