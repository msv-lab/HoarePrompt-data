Example Answer:
`su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. 
Output State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` remain adjusted, `i` is increased by 1, `su` is updated based on the value of `a[i]`.**
