Output State: **`n` is greater than `md + 2`, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, `i` is `md + 2`, `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in array `a` for the loop to execute one more time. If `su` is less than the element at index `i` in array `a`, `su` is updated to -1 and the loop or if statement is exited.**
