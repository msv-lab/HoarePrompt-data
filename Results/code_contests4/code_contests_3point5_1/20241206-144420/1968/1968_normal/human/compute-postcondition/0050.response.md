Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers; `md` is the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2; `su` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` up to the index `md + 2`; `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `i` is `md + 2`. If `su` is less than the element `a[i]` at index `md + 2, then `su` is updated to -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]` if `su` is less than the element `a[i]` at index `md + 2. Otherwise, no change occurs in `su` and the loop or if statement continues normally.***
