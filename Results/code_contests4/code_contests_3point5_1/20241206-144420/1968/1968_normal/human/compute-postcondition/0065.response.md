Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of the average of `be` and `en` by integer division. The loop will continue executing if `be` is less than or equal to `en`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers; `be` should be less than or equal to `en`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers; `be` should be less than or equal to `en`**
