According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the condition `su < a[i]` determines the final values of `su`, `be`, `en`, and `ans`. If `su < a[i]` is never met, then `su` will be the sum of elements in list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n`. If `su < a[i]` is met at least once during the loop execution, then `su` will be assigned `-1`, `be` will be assigned `md + 1`, and `en` and `ans` will be assigned `md - 1` and `md + 1` respectively. 

Since we need to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following adjustments:
1. If `su < a[i]` is never met, then `en` should be adjusted to `md` and `ans` should be adjusted to `md + 1`.
2. If `su < a[i]` is met at least once, then `be` should be adjusted to `md + 1`.

State: **`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers, respectively. For the loop to execute again, adjust the values based on the conditions mentioned above.**
