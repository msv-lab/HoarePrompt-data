Example Answer: 
The value of `su` is increased by the element `a[i]`. If the sum `su` becomes less than the element `a[i]` at index `i`, then `su` is set to -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than `md + 1`, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`. If `su` is less than the element `a[i]` at index `i`, then `su` is set to -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
