Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is any value less than or equal to `en`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is n, `md` is less than `n - 1`, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1` for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `md + 1` and less than `n`. Additionally, the sum `su` is less than the element at index `i` in list `a`***
