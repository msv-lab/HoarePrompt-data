Example Answer:
`rint` is assigned a lambda function that reads an integer from stdin using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rstr` lambda function `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from stdin.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rstr` lambda function `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from stdin**
