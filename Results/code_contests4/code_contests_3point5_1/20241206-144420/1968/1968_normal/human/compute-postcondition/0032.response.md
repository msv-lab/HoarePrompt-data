Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` are input integers and a sorted list of integers, respectively. `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`. After all iterations of the loop, `su` will either be the sum of elements in list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n` if the condition `su < a[i]` is never met, or `-1` if the condition is met at least once during the loop execution. Additionally, if `su == -1`, then the postcondition is satisfied.***
