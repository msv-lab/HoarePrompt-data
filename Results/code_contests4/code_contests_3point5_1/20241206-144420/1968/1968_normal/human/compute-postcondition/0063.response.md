Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers. If `su` is -1, then `be` is assigned the value `md + 1`, indicating there is at least one element in the list `a` from index `md + 1` onwards that is greater than `su`. If `su` is not -1, then `en` is updated to the value of `md - 1` and `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`.***
