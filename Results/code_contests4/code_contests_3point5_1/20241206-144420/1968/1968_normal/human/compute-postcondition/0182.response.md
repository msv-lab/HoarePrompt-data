Example Answer:
The variable `su` is assigned the sum of the elements in list `a` from index 0 to `md + 1`. Since `md` is 0, `md + 1` is 1. Therefore, `su` is the sum of the first element of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is n, `md` is 0, `su` is the sum of the first element of list `a`**
