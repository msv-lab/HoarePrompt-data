Output State: **n is greater than (md + 1) + 1, a is a sorted list of integers, i is equal to (md + 1) + 2, be is assigned the value of md + 1, be is less than or equal to en, if su is less than the element at index i in list a, su is assigned the value -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, su is incremented by the value at index i in list a.**
