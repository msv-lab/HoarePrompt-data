Example Answer:
`su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then the loop or if statement breaks without changing the values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are integers. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then the loop or if statement breaks without changing the values of the variables.
Output State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are integers. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then the loop or if statement breaks without changing the values of the variables.**
