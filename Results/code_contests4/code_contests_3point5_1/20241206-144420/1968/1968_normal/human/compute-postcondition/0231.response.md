Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `i`, `su` are adjusted accordingly. `su` will be the sum of elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `n` if the loop executes fully. If at any point `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks. If `su` is -1, then `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. If `su` is not -1, then `be`, `en`, `md`, `i`, `su` are adjusted accordingly. Additionally, `su` is not equal to -1; `ans` is determined by the value of `md`.***
