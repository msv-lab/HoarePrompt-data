Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `rint()` which reads an integer input, and `a` is assigned the sorted list of integers returned by `rints()`. The values of `n` and `a` are dependent on the input provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers**
