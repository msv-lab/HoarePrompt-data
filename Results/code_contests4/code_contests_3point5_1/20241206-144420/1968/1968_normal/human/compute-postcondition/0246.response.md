According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `md`, and `n` are adjusted accordingly. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `su`, `md` are adjusted accordingly for the next iteration**
