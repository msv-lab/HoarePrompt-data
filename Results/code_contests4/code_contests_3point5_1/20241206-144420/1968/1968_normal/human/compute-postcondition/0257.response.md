Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `i`, `su`, `md` are updated according to the last iteration. The loop will break if `su` is less than `a[i]` at any point during the iteration. If `su` is equal to -1, `be` is updated to `md + 1` and `en`, `ans`, `i`, `su`, `md` remain the same. If `su` is not equal to -1, `be`, `en`, `i`, `su`, `md` are updated according to the last iteration. The loop breaks if `su` is less than `a[i]`. Afterwards, `en` is updated to `md - 1` and `ans` is assigned the value `md + 1`.***
