According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `md`, `i`, and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `i` are adjusted accordingly. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1, and we break out of the most inner loop or if statement. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` are adjusted accordingly, `i` is incremented by 1, if `su` is less than `a[i]` then `su` is set to -1**
