Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers. If `su` is -1, then `be` is the index where the sum of elements in list `a` becomes less than the current sum, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the index where the sum of elements in list `a` becomes less than the current sum, `md` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2. If `su` is not -1, then `be` is 0, `en` is the index where the sum of elements in list `a` becomes less than the current sum, `ans` is the index where the sum of elements in list `a` becomes less than the current sum, `md` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2.**
