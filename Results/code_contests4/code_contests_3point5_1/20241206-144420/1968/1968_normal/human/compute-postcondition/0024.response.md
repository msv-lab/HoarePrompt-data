Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` are input integers and sorted list of integers, `su` is a sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the sum of `su` and `a[i]` should be greater than or equal to `a[i]`. If the sum `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md` are input integers and sorted list of integers, `su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
