According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is greater than `md + 1`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`. So to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `md + 1`, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, `su` remains either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`, and `i` is now equal to `md + 1`.
State: **`n` is greater than `md + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`, `i` is `md + 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
