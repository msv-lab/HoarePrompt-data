Output State: **`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers; `md` is the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2; `su` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` up to the index `md + 1` if there is no element in the list `a` from index `md + 1` onwards that is greater than `su`, otherwise `su` is not -1. `en` is updated to the value of `md - 1`; `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`.**
