Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are integers. If `su` is less than any element in list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1`, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, `en` is `md - 1`, `ans` is `md + 1`, and `su` contains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1`.***
