According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `md` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `md` is 0 and `i` is `md + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `be` is 0, `en` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is n. Also, `su` should be the sum of the first element of list `a`.
State: **`be` is 0, `en` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is n, `md` is 0, `su` is the sum of the first element of list `a`, `i` is `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
