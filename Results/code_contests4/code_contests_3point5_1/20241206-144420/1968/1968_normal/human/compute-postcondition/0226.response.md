Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `i`, `su` are adjusted accordingly, `su` will be the sum of elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `n` if the loop executes fully. If at any point `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is set to -1 and the loop breaks. Additionally, when the if condition is met and `su` is -1, the program state is such that `su` is equal to -1.***
