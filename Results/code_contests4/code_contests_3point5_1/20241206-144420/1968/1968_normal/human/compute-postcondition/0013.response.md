Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, which is equivalent to `(be + en) // 2`. The values of `be` and `en` are related to `n`, but `a` and `ans` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is any value less than or equal to `en`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is n, `md` is the result of `(be + en) // 2`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is any value less than or equal to `en`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is n, `md` is the result of `(be + en) // 2`**
