Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of the sum of `be` and `en` divided by 2. The values of `be` and `en` are adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`, `be` and `en` are adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`, `be` and `en` are adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute one more time**
