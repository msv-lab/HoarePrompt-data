Example Answer:
`rstr_2d` is assigned a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rstr` lambda function `n` times. The value of `n` is provided during the function call. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rstr` lambda function `n` times.
Output State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rstr` lambda function `n` times**
