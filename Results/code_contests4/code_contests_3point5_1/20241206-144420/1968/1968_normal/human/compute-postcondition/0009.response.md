According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input obtained from stdin. If the input is a valid integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that the input read from stdin is a valid integer. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified as follows:
State: **`rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rstr` lambda function `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from stdin, `rints` is a lambda function that creates a list of integers by applying `int(x)` for each element in the list obtained by splitting the input read from stdin, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rint` lambda function `n` times, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rints` lambda function `n` times; `pr` is a lambda function that takes arguments and a separator, converts the arguments to strings, joins them using the separator, and writes the result to stdout, for the loop to execute the first time the input obtained from stdin is a valid integer**
