Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `i` are adjusted accordingly. If `su` is not -1, `be`, `en`, `md`, `i`, `su` are modified based on loop body. If `su` is -1, `be` is set to `md + 1`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en >> 1`, `su` is updated with the sum of elements in the list `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time the length of list `a` is at least `md + 2`. Additionally, `su` is less than `a[i]`***
