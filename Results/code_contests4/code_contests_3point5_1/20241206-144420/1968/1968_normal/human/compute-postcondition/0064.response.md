According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of the variables are as follows: `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su`. To execute the loop one more time, `be` should be less than or equal to `en`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers. For the loop to execute again, `be` should be less than or equal to `en`**
