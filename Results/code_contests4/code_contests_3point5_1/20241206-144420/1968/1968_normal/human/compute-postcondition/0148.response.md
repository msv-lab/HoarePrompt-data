According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `be` needs to be adjusted to `be` is less than or equal to `en`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than md + 1, a is a sorted list of integers, su is either -1 or the sum of elements from index md + 1 to the end of list a, i is equal to n, su is equal to -1, be is assigned the value of md + 1 and for the loop to execute again, be is less than or equal to en**
