Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are input integers and a sorted list of integers; `md` is the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2; `su` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` up to the index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1`. Additionally, the sum `su` is less than the element `a[i]` at index `md + 1`.***
