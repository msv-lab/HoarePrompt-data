Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`, where `>>` is a right shift operator. The values of `be` and `en` are 0 and greater than or equal to 0 respectively. Therefore, the value of `md` will be 0 as well. The value of `ans` remains as `n`. 
Output State: **`be` is 0, `en` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is n, `md` is 0**
