According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `be` is less than or equal to `en`. Right before the loop, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, and `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `be` can be adjusted to any value less than or equal to `en`, as `be` is already at the starting point. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `be` is any value less than or equal to `en`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is n**
