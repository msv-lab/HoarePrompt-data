Example Answer: 
The lambda function `ceil1` takes two arguments `a` and `b` and calculates `(a + b - 1) // b`. The result is not stored in any variable. The variable `out` is declared as an empty list but not used in the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `rstr` is a lambda function that strips input read from stdin, `rstrs` is a lambda function that converts elements into strings and creates a list, `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rstr` lambda function `n` times, `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from stdin, `rints` is a lambda function that creates a list of integers by applying `int(x)` for each element in the list obtained by splitting the input read from stdin, `rint_2d` is a lambda function that creates a list by calling the `rint` lambda function `n` times, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by calling the `rints` lambda function `n` times; `pr` is a lambda function that takes arguments and a separator, converts the arguments to strings, joins them using the separator, and writes the result to stdout.
