Output State: **`n` is greater than `md + 1`, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`. If `su` is less than any element in `a` from index `md + 1` to `n - 1`, then `su` is set to -1. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `n - 1`.**
