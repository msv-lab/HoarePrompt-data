According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `md + 2`, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, `i` is `md + 1`, and `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in array `a`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `md + 2`.
- `n` needs to be greater than `md + 2` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than `md + 2`, `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `md`, `i` is `md + 2`, `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in array `a` for the loop to execute one more time**
