Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value `be + en >> 1`, where `>>` is the right shift operator. The value of `be` is `md + 1`, so the value of `md` is `(md + 1) + en >> 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than md + 1, a is a sorted list of integers, su is either -1 or the sum of elements from index md + 1 to the end of list a, i is equal to n, su is equal to -1, be is assigned the value of md + 1, be is less than or equal to en.
