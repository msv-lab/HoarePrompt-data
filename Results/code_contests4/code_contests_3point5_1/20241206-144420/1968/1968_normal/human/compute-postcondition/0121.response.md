Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers. If `su` is -1, then `be` is `md + 1`, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, and `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`. If `su` is not -1, then `be` is 0, `en` is `md - 1`, `ans` is `md + 1`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, and `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`.***
