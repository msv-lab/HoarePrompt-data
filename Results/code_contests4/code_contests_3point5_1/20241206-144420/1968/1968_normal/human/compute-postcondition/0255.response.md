Example Answer:
The value of `en` is updated to `md - 1`. The previous values of the variables are not given, so we cannot calculate the exact values of `en`. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `i`, `su`, `md` are updated according to the last iteration. The loop will break if `su` is less than `a[i]` at any point during the iteration. Additionally, `su` is not equal to -1 after the loop completes. `en` is updated to `md - 1`.
