Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `be` is 0, `en` is `md - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `md` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`. The sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a` is not equal to -1**
