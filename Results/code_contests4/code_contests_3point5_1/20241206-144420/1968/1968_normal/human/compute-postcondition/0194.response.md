According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su`, and `i+1` are integers.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are set to -1 and the loop is terminated.
- Increment `su` by the value of `a[i]`.
- Increment `i` by 1.
- Update the range of `i` for the next iteration to be from `md + 1` to `n`.

State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su` are integers, `i+1` is incremented by 1, `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n`**
