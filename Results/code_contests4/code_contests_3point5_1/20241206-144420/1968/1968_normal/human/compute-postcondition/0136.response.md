According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`, `i` is `md + 2`, and `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in list `a`. If `su` is less than the element at index `i` in list `a`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than `md + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `su` is either -1 or the sum of elements from index `md + 1` to the end of list `a`, `i` is `md + 3`, `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in list `a`**
