Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not handle the case when all players have the same number of tokens, which should result in all players having a non-zero probability of winning the championship. However, the code currently does not consider this scenario and only handles cases where players have different numbers of tokens.
- The output hints also do not mention this edge case, so it is not covered by the code.
