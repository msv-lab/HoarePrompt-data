Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input as specified, sorts the player tokens, and then calculates the number of players with a nonzero probability of winning the championship. The program iterates through the players and determines the cutoff point where the sum of tokens of the selected players exceeds the tokens of all other players. It then outputs the required information in the specified format.

The program handles multiple test cases and follows the rules of the championship accurately. It determines the correct number of players with a chance of winning and prints their numbers in increasing order. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
