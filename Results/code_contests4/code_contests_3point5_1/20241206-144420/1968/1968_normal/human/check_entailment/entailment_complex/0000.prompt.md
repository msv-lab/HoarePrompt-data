You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A championship is held in Berland, in which n players participate. The player with the number i has a_i (a_i ≥ 1) tokens.

The championship consists of n-1 games, which are played according to the following rules:

  * in each game, two random players with non-zero tokens are selected; 
  * the player with more tokens is considered the winner of the game (in case of a tie, the winner is chosen randomly); 
  * the winning player takes all of the loser's tokens; 



The last player with non-zero tokens is the winner of the championship.

All random decisions that are made during the championship are made equally probable and independently.

For example, if n=4, a = [1, 2, 4, 3], then one of the options for the game (there could be other options) is: 

  * during the first game, the first and fourth players were selected. The fourth player has more tokens, so he takes the first player's tokens. Now a = [0, 2, 4, 4]; 
  * during the second game, the fourth and third players were selected. They have the same number of tokens, but in a random way, the third player is the winner. Now a = [0, 2, 8, 0]; 
  * during the third game, the second and third players were selected. The third player has more tokens, so he takes the second player's tokens. Now a = [0, 0, 10, 0]; 
  * the third player is declared the winner of the championship. 



Championship winners will receive personalized prizes. Therefore, the judges want to know in advance which players have a chance of winning, i.e have a non-zero probability of winning the championship. You have been asked to find all such players. 

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case consists of one positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of players in the championship.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of tokens the players have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. 

Output

For each test case, print the number of players who have a nonzero probability of winning the championship. On the next line print the numbers of these players in increasing order. Players are numbered starting from one in the order in which they appear in the input. 

Example

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rstr_2d = lambda n: [rstr() for _ in range(n)]
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    rint_2d = lambda n: [rint() for _ in range(n)]
    rints_2d = lambda n: [rints() for _ in range(n)]
    pr = lambda args, sep: stdout.write(sep.join(map(str, args)) + '\n')
    ceil1, out = lambda a, b: (a + b - 1) // b, []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a = rint(), sorted(rints())
        
        be, en, ans = 0, n - 1, n
        
        while be <= en:
            md = be + en >> 1
            su = sum(a[:md + 1])
            for i in range(md + 1, n):
                if su < a[i]:
                    su = -1
                    break
                su += a[i]
            if su == -1:
                be = md + 1
            else:
                en = md - 1
                ans = md + 1
        
        out.append(n - ans + 1)
        
        out.append(' '.join(map(str, [x for x in range(ans, n + 1)])))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, the variables will have the final values based on the conditions inside the loop. The values of `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, `su`, and `out` will be determined by the calculations and comparisons made during the loop iterations. `out` will contain the necessary output values.
    pr(out, '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, performs calculations based on the input values, and outputs the results. The function calculates a specific value based on conditions inside a loop and appends it to an output list. Finally, it prints the output list separated by newlines.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
