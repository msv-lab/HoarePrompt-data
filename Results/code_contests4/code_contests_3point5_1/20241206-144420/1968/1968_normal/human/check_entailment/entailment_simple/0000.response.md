Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input for the number of test cases, the number of players in each test case, and the tokens each player has. Then, it sorts the tokens in ascending order and calculates the number of players who have a non-zero probability of winning the championship. The program iterates through the sorted tokens and checks if a player has a chance of winning by comparing their token sum with the tokens of the remaining players. It then outputs the number of players with a chance of winning along with their corresponding player numbers.

The program follows the rules of the championship described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.
