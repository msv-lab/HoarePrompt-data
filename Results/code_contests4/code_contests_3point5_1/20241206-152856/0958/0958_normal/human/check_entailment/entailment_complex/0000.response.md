Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input correctly, processes the 4x4 grid of panels, counts the occurrences of each digit in the grid, and then checks if the maximum occurrence of any digit is less than or equal to twice the input value `n`. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise, which aligns with the problem description. The program correctly determines if Cucumber boy is able to press all the panels in perfect timing based on the given input.
