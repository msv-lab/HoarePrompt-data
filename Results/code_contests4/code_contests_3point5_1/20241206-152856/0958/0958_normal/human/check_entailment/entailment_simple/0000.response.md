Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input, counts the occurrences of each digit in the grid, and then checks if the maximum count is less than or equal to 2 times the number of panels that can be pressed with one hand. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This aligns with the problem description where Cucumber boy must be able to press all panels in perfect timing with his one or two hands.

The program handles all cases as it correctly checks the timing constraints for pressing panels with one or two hands, ensuring that Cucumber boy can press all panels in perfect timing.
