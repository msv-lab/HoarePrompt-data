The function `func` reads input and processes a 4x4 grid representing a table of panels where each cell contains either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period. It then checks if the maximum occurrence of any digit in the grid is less than or equal to twice the input value `n` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
