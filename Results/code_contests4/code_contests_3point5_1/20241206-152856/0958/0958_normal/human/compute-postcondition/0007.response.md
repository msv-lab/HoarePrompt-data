According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input list from raw_input(). If the input list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes, i is 0, and j is not a period. 

To execute the loop one more time, the input list from raw_input() must have at least one more element.

State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes, i is 0, the input list in raw_input() has at least 2 elements, j is not a period**
