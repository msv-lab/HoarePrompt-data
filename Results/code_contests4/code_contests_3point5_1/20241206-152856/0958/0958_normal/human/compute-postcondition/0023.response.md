Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so the exact index cannot be determined. As a result, one of the values in the list `c` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 2, the input list is not empty**
