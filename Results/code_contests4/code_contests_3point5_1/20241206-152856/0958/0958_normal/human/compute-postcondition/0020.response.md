Example Answer: 
The value at index `j` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `c` after execution. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 1, the input list is not empty.
Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 1, the input list is not empty**
