Example Answer:
The value of `j` is used as an index to access the `c` list and increment the value at that index by 1. The value of `j` is converted to an integer before being used as an index. The previous state of `c` is a list containing 10 zeroes. Since the initial state specifies that `j` is not a period, it can be assumed that `j` is a valid index within the range [0, 9]. Therefore, after execution, the value at index `int(j)` in the `c` list will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with one of the values incremented by 1, i is 0, the input list in raw_input() has at least 2 elements, j is not a period**
