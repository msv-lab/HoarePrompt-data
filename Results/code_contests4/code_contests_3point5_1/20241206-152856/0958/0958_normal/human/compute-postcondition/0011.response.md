Example Answer:
The value at index `int(j)` in list `c` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is not a period, it is considered as an integer value. The variable `i` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with one of the values incremented by 1, i is 0, the input list in raw_input() has at least 3 elements, j is not a period.
