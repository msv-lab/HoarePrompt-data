According to the code, the loop will execute 4 times as i iterates over the range(4). The loop does not depend on k or the table of panels. At the end of the loop, c is a list containing 10 zeroes. So for the loop to execute the first time, the initial state needs to be adjusted to i is 0.
State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid where each cell contains either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period, c is a list containing 10 zeroes, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0**
