Example Answer:
The value of `j` is used to access the index in list `c`, and 1 is added to the value at that index. The value of `j` must not be a period for the code to execute. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: *k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid where each cell contains either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period, c is a list containing 10 zeroes, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0, the input list in raw_input() has at least 1 element, j is not a period.
