Example Answer:
The list `c` is initialized as a list containing 10 zeroes. This list will be used to keep track of the count of each digit from 1 to 9 in the grid of panels. The other variables and the grid of panels are not affected by this initialization.
Output State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5. The table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid where each cell contains either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period. c is a list containing 10 zeroes.**
