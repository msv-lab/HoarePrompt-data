According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 3.
State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 3**
