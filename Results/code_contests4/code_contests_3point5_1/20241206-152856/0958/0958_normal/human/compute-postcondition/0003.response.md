According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input given by the user in the raw_input() function. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the input list must have at least 1 element. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid where each cell contains either a digit from 1 to 9 or a period, c is a list containing 10 zeroes, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0, the input list in raw_input() has at least 1 element**
