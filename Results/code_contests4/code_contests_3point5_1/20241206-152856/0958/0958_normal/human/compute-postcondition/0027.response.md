According to the code, the loop will execute depending on the input provided by the user. Since the input can vary, we need to focus on the initial state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, the input list must not be empty. Additionally, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the input list to iterate over.

State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 3, for the loop to execute the input list provided by the user must not be empty**
