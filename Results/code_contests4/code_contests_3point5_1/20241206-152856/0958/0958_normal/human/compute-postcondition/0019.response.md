According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the input list. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the input list must not be empty.
State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 1, the input list is not empty**
