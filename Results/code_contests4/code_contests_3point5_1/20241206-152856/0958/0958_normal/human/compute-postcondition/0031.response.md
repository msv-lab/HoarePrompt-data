According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input list provided by the user. If the list is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, updated list `c` containing incremented values, i is 3, for the loop to execute the input list provided by the user must not be empty, and j is not equal to '.'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the input list provided by the user must still not be empty, and j must still not be equal to '.'. Additionally, k, i, and the updated list `c` will remain the same. Therefore, the only change required is to ensure that j is not equal to '.' for the next iteration.
