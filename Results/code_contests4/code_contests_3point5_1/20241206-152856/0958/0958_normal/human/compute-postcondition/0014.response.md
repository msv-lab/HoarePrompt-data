According to the code, the loop will iterate 4 times, as specified by range(4). At the end of the previous iteration, k is an integer between 1 and 5, the table of panels is a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, and i is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since i will be increased by 1 in the next iteration, i should be updated to 1.
- The loop will execute again if i is less than 4, so i being 1 satisfies this condition.
- No mention of k, the table of panels, or c being changed in the loop, so they remain the same.

State: **k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, the table of panels is represented as a 4x4 grid, c is a list containing 10 zeroes with some values possibly incremented, i is 1**.
