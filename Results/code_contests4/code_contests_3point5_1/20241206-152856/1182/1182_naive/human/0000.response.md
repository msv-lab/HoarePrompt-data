Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description. It is overly complicated and inefficient. It does not follow the rule of changing the string into a string of length N-1 by selecting either the i-th or (i+1)-th character. 

Additionally, the program uses functions like `numpy` which are not required for this problem and make the code unnecessarily complex. 

Overall, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of operations to achieve the objective described in the problem statement.
