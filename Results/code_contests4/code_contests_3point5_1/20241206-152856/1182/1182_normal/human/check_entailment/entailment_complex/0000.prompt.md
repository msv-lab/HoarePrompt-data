You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke can change a string t of length N into a string t' of length N - 1 under the following rule:

* For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1), the i-th character of t' must be either the i-th or (i + 1)-th character of t.



There is a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Snuke's objective is to apply the above operation to s repeatedly so that all the characters in s are the same. Find the minimum necessary number of operations.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.**
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    b = []
    for k in range(len(a)):
        b.append(a[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string of length at least 1, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is equal to the length of string `a`
    b = np.array(b)
    alp = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    al = []
    for k in range(len(alp)):
        al.append(alp[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string of length at least 1, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is equal to the length of string `alp`, `b` is now converted to a NumPy array, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` contains all lowercase English letters
    res = []
    for aa in al:
        if aa in b:
            res.append(np.where(b == aa))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string of length at least 1, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order and is now a NumPy array, `k` is equal to the length of string `alp`, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` contains the indices where each lowercase English letter in `al` is present in the NumPy array `b` after all iterations of the loop have executed.
    m = []
    for k in range(len(res)):
        zz = np.hstack([np.array([0]), res[k][0], np.array([len(a)])])
        
        z = np.diff(zz)
        
        if len(z) > 0:
            m.append(np.max(z))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the length of `res` is greater than 0, then `m` will contain the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, `m` will remain an empty list. Rest of the variables retain their initial values.
    if (len(m) > 0) :
        ans = np.min(m)
    else :
        ans = len(a)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If the length of `res` is greater than 0, then `m` will contain the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. `ans` is either the minimum value of `m` or 0 if `m` is empty. Otherwise, if the length of `res` is not greater than 0, then `m` will remain an empty list. `z` will have the maximum value for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Rest of the variables retain their initial values.
    ans -= 1
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function operates on a string 's' consisting of lowercase English letters. It converts the string 's' into a NumPy array 'b'. It then iterates through all lowercase English letters, checks their presence in 'b', and stores the indices where each letter is found in 'res'. After that, it calculates the maximum consecutive occurrences of each letter in 'res' and stores the maximum values in 'm'. Finally, it determines the minimum value in 'm' and subtracts 1 from it, printing the result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
