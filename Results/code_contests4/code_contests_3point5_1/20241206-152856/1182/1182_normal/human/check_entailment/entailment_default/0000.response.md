Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes a string `s` as input and converts it into a NumPy array `b`.
- It then iterates through all lowercase English letters and checks their presence in `b`, storing the indices where each letter is found in `res`.
- Next, it calculates the maximum consecutive occurrences of each letter in `res` and stores the maximum values in `m`.
- Finally, it determines the minimum value in `m`, subtracts 1 from it, and prints the result.

The code seems to follow the problem description correctly by finding the minimum necessary number of operations to achieve the objective of making all characters in the string `s` the same. The code seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The logic and implementation appear to be correct based on the problem description.
