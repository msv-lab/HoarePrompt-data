The function operates on a string 's' consisting of lowercase English letters. It converts the string 's' into a NumPy array 'b'. It then iterates through all lowercase English letters, checks their presence in 'b', and stores the indices where each letter is found in 'res'. After that, it calculates the maximum consecutive occurrences of each letter in 'res' and stores the maximum values in 'm'. Finally, it determines the minimum value in 'm' and subtracts 1 from it, printing the result.
