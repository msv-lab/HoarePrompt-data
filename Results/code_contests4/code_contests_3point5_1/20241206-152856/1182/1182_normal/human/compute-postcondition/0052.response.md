Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the length of list `a`. The value of `a` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: If the length of `res` is not greater than 0, then `m` will remain an empty list. `z` will have maximum value for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Rest of the variables retain their initial values.
Output State: **If the length of `res` is not greater than 0, then `m` will remain an empty list. `z` will have maximum value for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Rest of the variables retain their initial values**
