Example Answer:
`al` is appended with the character at index `k` of string `alp`, which is the lowercase English letter at index 1. Since indexing starts at 0, the letter at index 1 is 'b'. Therefore, after execution, `al` will contain the letter 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string of length at least 1, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order, `k` is 1, `b` is now converted to a NumPy array, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` contains the letter 'b'**
