Example Answer:
`b` appends the element `a[k]`, where `k` is 0 initially. Since `a` is a string of length at least 1, `a[k]` will be the first character of the string `a`. Therefore, after execution, `b` will contain the first character of string `a` and the value of `k` will remain 0. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string of length at least 1, `b` contains the first character of string `a`, `k` is 0**
