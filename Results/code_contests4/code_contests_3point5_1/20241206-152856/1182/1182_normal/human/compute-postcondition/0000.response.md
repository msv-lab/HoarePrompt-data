`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which reads a line of input from the user as a string. The value of `s` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string input from the user.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string input from the user**
