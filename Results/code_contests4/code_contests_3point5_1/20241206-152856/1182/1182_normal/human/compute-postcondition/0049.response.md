Postcondition: ***If the length of `res` is greater than 0, then `m` will contain the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, `m` will remain an empty list. `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Rest of the variables retain their initial values.***
