Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a string of length at least 1, `b` contains all characters of string `a` in order and is now a NumPy array, `k` is 0, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` contains the indices where each lowercase English letter in `al` is present in the NumPy array `b` after all iterations of the loop have executed and has at least 1 index, `m` contains the maximum value of `z` appended, `zz` is a NumPy array created by horizontally stacking 0, the first index of the first element in `res[k]`, and the length of string `a`, `z` is the result of the difference operation on `zz`. If the length of `z` is greater than 0, then the maximum value of `z` is appended to `m`.***
