According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `res`. If the length of `res` is greater than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of `res` must be greater than `k`. 
State: **`s`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `alp`, `al`, `res`, `m`, `zz`, `z` are as described in the precondition. If the length of `z` is greater than 0, then the maximum value of `z` is appended to `m`. Otherwise, no changes are made to any of the variables, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `res` must be greater than `k`.**
