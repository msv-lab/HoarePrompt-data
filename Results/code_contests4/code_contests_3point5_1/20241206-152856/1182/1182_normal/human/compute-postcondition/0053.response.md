Postcondition: ***If the length of `res` is greater than 0, then `m` will contain the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. `ans` is either the minimum value of `m` or 0 if `m` is empty. Otherwise, if the length of `res` is not greater than 0, then `m` will remain an empty list. `z` will have the maximum value for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Rest of the variables retain their initial values.***
