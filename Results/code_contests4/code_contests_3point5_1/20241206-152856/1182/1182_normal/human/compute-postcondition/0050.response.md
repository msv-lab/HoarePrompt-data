Example Answer:
If the length of `res` is greater than 0, then `m` will contain the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, `m` will remain an empty list. `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Rest of the variables retain their initial values.

After executing `ans = np.min(m)`, the minimum value of `m` will be assigned to `ans`. Since the initial state of `m` is either containing the maximum value of `z` for elements in `res` or an empty list, the minimum value of an empty list is `0`. Therefore, if `m` is empty, `ans` will be `0`.

Output State: **If the length of `res` is greater than 0, then `m` will contain the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, `m` will remain an empty list. `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` for each element in `res` that satisfies the condition. Rest of the variables retain their initial values. `ans` is either the minimum value of `m` or `0` if `m` is empty.**
