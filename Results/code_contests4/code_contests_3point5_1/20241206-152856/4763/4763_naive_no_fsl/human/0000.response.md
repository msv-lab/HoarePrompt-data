Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as required.
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_6` are not used in the given code.
- The `func_3` function handles the logic of determining if a given bitstring can be made k-balanced by replacing '?' characters.
- The `func_4` function processes each test case by calling `func_3` and correctly prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.
- The input and output handling functions `FastI`, `FastO`, and `input` are used to optimize input/output operations.

Overall, the code structure and logic implementation seem correct based on the problem description provided.
