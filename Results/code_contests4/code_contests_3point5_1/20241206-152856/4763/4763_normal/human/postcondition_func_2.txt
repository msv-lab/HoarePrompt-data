The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k, and a string s of length n composed of 0, 1, and ?, and `k`, an even integer. The function iterates through the elements of arr and updates them based on certain conditions. It returns False in multiple cases specified by the annotations, and finally returns True if none of the previous conditions are met. The function has multiple return points based on the input parameters and the conditions checked during execution.
