The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and k is even. The string s of length n consists of only 0, 1, and ?. The function then returns the set of divisors of 'n' that are factors of 'n'.
