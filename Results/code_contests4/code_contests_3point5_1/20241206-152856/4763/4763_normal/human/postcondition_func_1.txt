The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and generates an array `arr` of length at least 5 filled with specific values. The function populates the array based on a certain pattern, where each element represents a factor of its index. The pattern is implemented using nested loops, assigning factors to corresponding elements in the array. The function then returns the generated array `arr`. It is important to note that the pattern generation logic is not explicitly defined in the annotations, so the specific pattern followed by the array values is not detailed.
