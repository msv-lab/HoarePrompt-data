According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. If `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, and there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` is updated to be not equal to '?', `vis` contains 'put' and the value of `arr[j]`, `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is 2, the length of `arr` remains the same, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, all elements in `arr` between index `i` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?', `arr[i+1]` is valid, and `vis` is an empty set, and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`arr[i+1]` is updated to be not equal to '?', `vis` contains 'put' and the value of `arr[j]`, `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i+1` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is 2, the length of `arr` remains the same, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, all elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', `arr[i+2]` is valid, and `vis` is an empty set, and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'**
