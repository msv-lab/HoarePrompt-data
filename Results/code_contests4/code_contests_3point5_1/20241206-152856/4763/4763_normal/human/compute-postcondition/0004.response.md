According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the previous value of `y`, and `y` is the remainder of `x` divided by the previous value of `y`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the current value of `y` needs to be not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is the previous value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of `x` divided by the previous value of `y` for the loop to execute again `y` is not equal to 0**
