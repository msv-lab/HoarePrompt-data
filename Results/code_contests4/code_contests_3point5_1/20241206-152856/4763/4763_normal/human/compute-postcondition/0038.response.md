According to the code, the loop can execute if the range defined by `i`, `len(arr)`, and `k` is valid. 

1. The loop can start at index `i` and should end before `len(arr)` considering the step size `k`.
2. The length of `vis` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not equal to 2 before the loop starts.
3. Only one element should be present in `vis`, and that element should be stored in `put`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr)`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis` and the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `put` is the only element present in `vis`, for the loop to execute `j` is less than `len(arr)` considering the step size `k`**.
