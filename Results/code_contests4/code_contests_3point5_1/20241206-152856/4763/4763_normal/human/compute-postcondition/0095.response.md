Postcondition: ***`arr[i+1]` is valid, `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` is set correctly, all elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', the length of `vis` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `i` is within the bounds of the list. In addition, `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to '?'***
