According to the code, the loop can execute again if `arr[j]` is either not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to '?' or if `arr[j]` is equal to '?' and all the other conditions mentioned are true. At the end of the last iteration, all the conditions mentioned are true, `j` is within the bounds of the list. So for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the conditions hold true and `j` is incremented by `k` and still within the bounds of the list.
State: **All elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', all elements in `arr` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?', `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` is set correctly, the length of `vis` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `j` is a valid index within the bounds of the list, and the loop continues with the next iteration for `j` to be incremented by `k` if `arr[j]` != `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` != '?'. If `arr[j]` is '?', then all the conditions mentioned previously hold true, and `j` is incremented by `k`.
