According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`arr[i]` is updated to be not equal to '?', `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is 1, the length of `arr` remains the same, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, all elements in `arr` between index `i` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?', `arr[i+1]` is valid, and `vis` is an empty set**.
