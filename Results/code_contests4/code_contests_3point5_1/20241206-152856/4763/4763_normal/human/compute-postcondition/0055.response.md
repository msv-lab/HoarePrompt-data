According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `arr`, and `vis`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` is valid, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, and the length of `vis` is at least 1. The elements at indexes `i` and `j` in `arr` are either equal or `arr[j]` is equal to '?'. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `j` needs to be incremented by `k`
- If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then the element at index `j` in `arr` should remain as '?'

State: **`arr[i]` is valid, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by `k`, and if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', the element at index `j` in `arr` remains as '?'**
