Example Answer: 
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped with each other, and `x` is assigned the value `x % y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are unknown, so the new values depend on the initial values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a new value, `y` is a new value.
Output State: **`x` is a new value, `y` is a new value**
