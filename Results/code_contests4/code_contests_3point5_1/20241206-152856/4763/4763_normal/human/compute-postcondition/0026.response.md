According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and the elements in the list `arr`. If `j` is less than `len(arr)` and `arr[j] != '?'`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `vis` is a set containing the element at index `i` in `arr`, `i` is less than `len(arr)` and `j` is `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to the next index based on the value of `k`, and `vis` should be updated to include the new element at index `j` in `arr`.
State: **`vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr`, `j` is less than `len(arr)` and `arr[j] != '?'`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, and `j` is `i + k`**
