Output State: **All elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', all elements in `arr` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?', `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[i]`, `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` is set correctly, the length of `vis` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `j` is a valid index within the bounds of the list, and the loop continues with the next iteration for `j` to be incremented by `k` if `arr[j]` != `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` != '?'. If `arr[j]` is '?', then all the conditions mentioned previously hold true, and `j` is incremented by `k`.**
