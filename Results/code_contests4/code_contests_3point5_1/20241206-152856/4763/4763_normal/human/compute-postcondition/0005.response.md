Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the previous value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the remainder of `x` divided by the previous value of `y`. The loop will execute again as long as `y` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the previous value of the initial `x`, `y` is the remainder of the initial `x` divided by the initial `y`.
Output State: **`x` is the previous value of the initial `y`, `y` is the remainder of the initial `x` divided by the initial `y`**
