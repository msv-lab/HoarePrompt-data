Postcondition: ***`arr[i]` is valid, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time the length of `vis` is at least 1. The elements at indexes `i` and `j` in `arr` are either equal or `arr[j]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then the element at index `j` in `arr` remains as '?'.***
