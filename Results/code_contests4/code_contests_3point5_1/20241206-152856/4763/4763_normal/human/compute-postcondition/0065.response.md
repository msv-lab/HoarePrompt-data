Output State: **`arr[i]` is valid, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is at least 1. All elements in `arr` between index `i` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?'. If any element is '?', it will be updated to be the same as `arr[i]`.**
