Output State: **`arr[i]` is equal to 'put', `vis` is a set containing all unique values of `arr[j]` where `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `put` is assigned the next unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is the number of unique non-'?' values in `arr` + 1, for the loop to execute `arr` has a length greater than `i`, `k` is greater than 0, `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `j` is updated to the next index in the range and `k` is a positive value, `arr[j]` is assigned the value 'put'**
