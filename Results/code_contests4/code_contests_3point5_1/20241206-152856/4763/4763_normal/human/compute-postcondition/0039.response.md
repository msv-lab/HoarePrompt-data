Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in the array `arr` is updated to the value `put`. Since `vis` contains only one element `put`, which is assigned to `vis`, the length of `vis` remains 1. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(arr)`. 
Output State: **`vis` contains only `put`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr)`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis`, `put` is the only element present in `vis`, loop continues with `j` less than `len(arr)` considering step size `k`**
