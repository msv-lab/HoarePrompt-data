The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k, and a string s of length n composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?, and `k`, which is an even integer. 

The function `func_3` has multiple return points, each represented by a case. 

In Case 1 to Case 14, the program returns either True or False. The function seems to have a complex logic based on the input parameters, but without details on the implementation, we can only conclude that the function has different return values depending on the input.
