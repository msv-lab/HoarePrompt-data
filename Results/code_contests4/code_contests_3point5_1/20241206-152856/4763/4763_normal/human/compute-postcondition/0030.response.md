Example Answer:
The element at index `j` in `arr` is added to the set `vis`. The conditions for `j` and the element at index `j` in `arr` are already specified in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the element at index `j` in `arr` is added to the set `vis`.
Output State: **`vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr`, `j` is less than `len(arr)`, `arr[j] != '?'`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `i + k + k`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is added to the set `vis` if `arr[j] != '?'`**
