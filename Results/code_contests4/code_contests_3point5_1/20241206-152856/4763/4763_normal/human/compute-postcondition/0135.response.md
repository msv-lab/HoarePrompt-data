Example Answer:
The value of `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, which was updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`. The value of `j` is calculated as `i + 2k`. It is important that `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`.
Output State: **`put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`**
