Postcondition: ***For the loop to execute the first time, arr is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string s of length n composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?, i is 0. After the if else block executes, if arr[i] is not '?', each element in arr that was initially '?' is replaced with the corresponding element at index i in arr, and any non-matching elements cause the program to return False. The values of n, k, and s remain the same as the initial state. If arr[i] is '?', `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr)`, and the length of `vis` is not equal to 2. If the length of `vis` is equal to 1, all elements in `arr` will be equal to `put`, `vis` will contain only `put`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis`, and `put` is the only element present in `vis`.***
