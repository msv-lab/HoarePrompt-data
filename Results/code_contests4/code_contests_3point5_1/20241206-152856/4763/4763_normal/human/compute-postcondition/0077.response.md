Postcondition: ***`arr[j]` is not equal to '?'. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the value of `arr[j]` and another value. `put` remains unaffected. `i` remains unaffected. The length of `vis` is 2 if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'. For the loop to execute another time, `arr` has a length greater than `j`. `k` is greater than 0. `j` is equal to `i + 2k`.***
