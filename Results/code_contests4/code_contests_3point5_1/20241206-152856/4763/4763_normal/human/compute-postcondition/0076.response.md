Output State: **`arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the value of `arr[j]` and another value if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `put` is not affected, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 2 if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', for the loop to execute another time `arr` has a length greater than `j`, `k` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`**
