According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `len(arr)`, and the content of the `vis` list. At the end of the last iteration, `vis` contains only `put`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr)`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis`, `put` is the only element present in `vis`, and the loop continues with `j` less than `len(arr)` considering step size `k`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`vis` contains only `put`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is less than `len(arr)`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis`, `put` is the only element present in `vis`, loop continues with `j` less than `len(arr)` considering step size `k`**
