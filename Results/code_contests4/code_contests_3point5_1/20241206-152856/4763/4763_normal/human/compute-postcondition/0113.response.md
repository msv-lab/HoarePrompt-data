Output State: **`arr[i+1]` is valid, `vis` is an empty set, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is 0, all elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?'. If any element is '?', it will be updated to be the same as `arr[i+1]`. If `arr[i+1]` is equal to '?', `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 1, the length of `arr` remains the same, `k` is greater than 0, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2. Additionally, `arr[i]` is equal to '?'**
