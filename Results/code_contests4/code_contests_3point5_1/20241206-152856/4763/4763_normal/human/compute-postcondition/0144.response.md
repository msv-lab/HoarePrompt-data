Example Answer:
The value of `dic[arr[i]]` is incremented by 1. `arr` is not defined in the initial state, so `arr[i]` is undefined. Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is equivalent to `arr[1]`. Therefore, the value of `dic[arr[1]]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `dic` is {'1': 1, '0': 0, '?': 0}, so after execution, the value of `dic` becomes {'1': 2, '0': 0, '?': 0}. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`dic` is {'1': 2, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is 1, `k` is 1**
