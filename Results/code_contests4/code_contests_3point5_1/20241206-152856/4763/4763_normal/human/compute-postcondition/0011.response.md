Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is converted to a string and written to the `file` object. The `sep` variable is not affected, `file` is updated with the string representation of `x`, `at_start` remains False, and `args` still has elements. 
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is updated with the string representation of `x`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, `x` is the next element in `args`, and `at_start` is not True**
