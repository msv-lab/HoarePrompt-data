State: **`arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing all unique values of `arr[j]` where `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `put` is assigned the first unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is the number of unique non-'?' values in `arr`, for the loop to execute `arr` has a length greater than `i`, `k` is greater than 0, `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, and the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `j` is equal to `i` and `k` is a positive value**

This adjustment ensures that the loop can execute based on the provided conditions and variables.
