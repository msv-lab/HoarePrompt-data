According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and `k` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`dic` is {'1': 1, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than 1**
