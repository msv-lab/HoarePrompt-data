According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(arr)`, and the contents of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple where each tuple contains two integers n and k, a string s of length n, `i` is 0, and the conditions regarding `vis`, `put`, and `j` as mentioned. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `arr[i]` is not '?', then for the next iteration, the elements in `arr` that were initially '?' must be replaced with the corresponding element at index `i` in `arr`.
- If `arr[i]` is '?':
  - If the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, then the loop can execute again.
  - If the length of `vis` is equal to 1 and all elements in `arr` should be equal to `put`, then `vis` should contain only `put`, `i` should be less than `len(arr)`, `j` should be `len(arr)`, the length of `vis` should not be equal to 2, only one element should be present in `vis`, and `put` should be the only element present in `vis`.

State: **For the loop to execute one more time, the adjustments needed are based on the conditions related to `arr[i]`, `vis`, `put`, `i`, and the length of `vis` as mentioned in the program description.**
