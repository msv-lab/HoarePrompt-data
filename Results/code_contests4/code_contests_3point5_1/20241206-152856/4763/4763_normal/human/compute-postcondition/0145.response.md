According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be 2 and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`dic` is {'1': 2, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is 2, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
