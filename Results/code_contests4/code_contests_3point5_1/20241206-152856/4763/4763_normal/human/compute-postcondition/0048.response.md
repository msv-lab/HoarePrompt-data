According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr[i]`, `vis`, `put`, `k`, and the length of `vis`. If the length of `arr` is at least `i+1`, `k` is greater than 0, `vis` is a non-empty list, and `i` is within the bounds of the list, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:
State: **`arr[i]` is valid, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time the length of `vis` is at least 1**
