According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, and `k`. If the length of `arr` is at least 1 and `k` is a positive value, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `put` needs to be updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`. So for the loop to execute the first time, `put` should be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `arr` has a length of at least 1.
State: **`put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value**
