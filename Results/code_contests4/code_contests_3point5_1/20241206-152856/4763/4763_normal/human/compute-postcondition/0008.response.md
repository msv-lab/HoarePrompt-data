The function `func_6` accepts two parameters: `x`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `y`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string `s` of length `n` composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'x' and 'y', where 'y' is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, where x is an integer representing the number of test cases and y is a list of tuples. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'x' and 'y', where 'y' is 0.**
