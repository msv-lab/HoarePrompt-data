According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and the contents of the list `arr`. If `j` is less than `len(arr)` and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr`, `j` is less than `len(arr)`, `arr[j] != '?'`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `i + k`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr`, `j` is less than `len(arr)`, `arr[j] != '?'`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `i + k + k`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is added to the set `vis` if `arr[j] != '?'`**.
