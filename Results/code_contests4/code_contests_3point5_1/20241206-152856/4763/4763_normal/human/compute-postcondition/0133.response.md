Example Answer:
`arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, where `put` is the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`. `j` is equal to `i + k`. The loop will execute another time only if `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value. Therefore, the Output State is: `put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, for the loop to execute another time `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value.
Output State: **`put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, for the loop to execute another time `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value**
