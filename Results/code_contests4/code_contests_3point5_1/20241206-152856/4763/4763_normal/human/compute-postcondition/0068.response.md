According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, and `k`. The loop will execute if the length of `arr` is greater than `i` and `k` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `arr[i]` is equal to '?' does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` has a length greater than `i`, `k` is greater than 0 and `j` is equal to `i`.
State: **`arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is an empty set, `put` is not affected, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` has a length greater than `i`, `k` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i`**
