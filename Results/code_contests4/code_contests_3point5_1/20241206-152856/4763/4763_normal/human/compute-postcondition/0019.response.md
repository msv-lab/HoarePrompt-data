The code snippet removes the key 'end' from the `kwargs` dictionary and writes its value to the `file`. The default value written to the `file` is a newline character if 'end' key is not present in `kwargs`. The initial state does not mention the presence or absence of 'end' key in `kwargs`, so it is not possible to determine the exact value that will be written to the `file`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is updated with the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is updated with the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty**
