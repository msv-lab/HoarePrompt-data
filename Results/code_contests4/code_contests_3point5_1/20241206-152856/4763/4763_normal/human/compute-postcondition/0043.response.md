Example Answer:
`arr[j]` is assigned the value `put`, and since `vis` contains only `put`, the value assigned to `arr[j]` will be `put`. The loop will continue with `j` less than `len(arr)` considering the step size `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `vis` contains only `put`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is updated based on step size `k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the next value `put`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis`, `put` is the only element present in `vis`, loop continues with `j` less than `len(arr)` considering step size `k`.
Output State: **`vis` contains only `put`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is updated based on step size `k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the next value `put`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis`, `put` is the only element present in `vis`, loop continues with `j` less than `len(arr)` considering step size `k`**
