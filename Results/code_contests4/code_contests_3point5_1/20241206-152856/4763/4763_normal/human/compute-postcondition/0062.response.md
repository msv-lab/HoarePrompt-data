Postcondition: ***`arr[i]` is valid, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is at least 1, `j` is within the bounds of the list `arr` and incremented by `k`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
