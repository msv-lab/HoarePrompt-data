According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `arr`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and the length of `vis`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the value of `arr[j]` and another value if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `put` is not affected, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 2 if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `j` is equal to `i + k`, `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `arr[j]` should be not equal to '?'
- `j` should be updated to the next value based on the increment `k`, so `j` should be `i + 2k`
- The length of `vis` should be updated accordingly based on the new value of `arr[j]`

State: **`arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the value of `arr[j]` and another value if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `put` is not affected, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 2 if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', for the loop to execute another time `arr` has a length greater than `j`, `k` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`**
