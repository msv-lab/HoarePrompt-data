Example Answer:
The set `vis` is updated by adding the value of `arr[j]`. Since `vis` contained 'put' before, and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the value of `arr[j]` is added to `vis`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[i+1]` is updated to be not equal to '?', `vis` contains 'put' and the value of `arr[j]`, `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i+1` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is 2, the length of `arr` remains the same, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, all elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', `arr[i+2]` is valid, and `vis` is an empty set, and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'.
Output State: **`arr[i+1]` is updated to be not equal to '?', `vis` contains 'put' and the value of `arr[j]`, `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i+1` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is 2, the length of `arr` remains the same, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, all elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', `arr[i+2]` is valid, and `vis` is an empty set, and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'**
