Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables will depend on the initial state of the input list arr. If the loop does not execute, the values of n, k, and s will remain the same as the initial state. If the loop executes, the elements of arr will be updated according to the conditions outlined in the loop code. All elements in arr between index i and len(arr) will either be equal to arr[i] or '?'. If arr[i] is not equal to '?', then all elements in arr will be updated to be the same as arr[i]. If arr[i] is '?', then all elements in arr will be updated to be the same as the last unique non-'?' value in arr. Additionally, if len(vis) is equal to 1, all elements in arr will be updated to be the same as the only element in vis. If len(vis) is equal to 2, the program will return False.**
