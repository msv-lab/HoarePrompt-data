According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `y` is not empty. Right before the loop, `x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `y` is a list of tuples. To ensure that the loop executes the first time, the list `y` should contain at least one tuple. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `y` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple**
