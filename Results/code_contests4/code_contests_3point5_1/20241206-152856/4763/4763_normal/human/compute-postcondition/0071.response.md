Postcondition: ***`arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the value of `arr[j]` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`, `put` is not affected, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 1 if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` has a length greater than `i`, `k` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i`, `arr[j]` is not equal to '?' if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`.***
