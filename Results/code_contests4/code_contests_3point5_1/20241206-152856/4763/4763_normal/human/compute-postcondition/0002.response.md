According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` evaluates to true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a new value, and `y` is a new value. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `y` evaluates to true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is a new value, `y` needs to evaluate to true for the loop to execute again**
