Postcondition: ***All conditions specified in the precondition hold true. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then all elements in `arr` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?', `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` is set correctly, the length of `vis` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is within the bounds of the list, and all elements between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are equal to `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to '?', then `arr[i]` is updated to be not equal to '?', `vis` contains all unique non-'?' values in `arr`, `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is at least 1, the length of `arr` remains the same, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2. Additionally, all elements in `arr` between index `i` and `len(arr)` are either equal to the corresponding elements in `vis` or '?', `arr[i+1]` is valid, and `vis` is an empty set. After the if else block executes, `put` will remain updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, and all elements in `arr` at indices that are multiples of `k` starting from index `i` will be assigned the value of `put`.***
