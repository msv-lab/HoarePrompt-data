Example Answer:
The value of `arr[j]` is assigned the value 'put', which means the next unique non-'?' value in `arr`. Since `vis` contains all unique non-'?' values in `arr`, the length of `vis` remains the same. The value of `j` is updated to the next index in the range. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[i]` is equal to 'put', `vis` is a set containing all unique values of `arr[j]` where `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `put` is assigned the next unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is the number of unique non-'?' values in `arr` + 1, for the loop to execute `arr` has a length greater than `i`, `k` is greater than 0, `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `j` is updated to the next index in the range and `k` is a positive value, `arr[j]` is assigned the value 'put', for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be updated to the next index in the range and `arr[j]` should be assigned the value 'put.
Output State: **`arr[i]` is equal to 'put', `vis` is a set containing all unique values of `arr[j]` where `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', `put` is assigned the next unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is the number of unique non-'?' values in `arr` + 1, for the loop to execute `arr` has a length greater than `i`, `k` is greater than 0, `len(vis)` is not equal to 2, the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `j` is updated to the next index in the range and `k` is a positive value, `arr[j]` is assigned the value 'put', for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be updated to the next index in the range and `arr[j]` should be assigned the value 'put.**
