Postcondition: ***`arr[i+1]` is valid, `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` is set correctly, all elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', the length of `vis` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `i` is within the bounds of the list. Also, all elements in `arr` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?', `j` is a valid index within the bounds of the list, and the loop continues with the next iteration. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the element at index `j` in `arr` is equal to '?'***
