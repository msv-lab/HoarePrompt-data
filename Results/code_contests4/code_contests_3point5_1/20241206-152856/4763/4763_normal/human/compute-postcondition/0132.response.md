According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `arr`, and `k`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, for the loop to execute the first time `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by `k`, `arr` should still have elements left to iterate over, and `k` should still be a positive value.
State: **`put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, for the loop to execute another time `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value**
