According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. Since `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, and the length of `arr` remains the same, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the key states that need adjustment are:
- The value at index `j` should be equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?'
- If `arr[i+1]` is '?', update all '?' elements in `arr` from index `i+1` to `len(arr)` to be the same as `arr[i+1]`
- If `arr[i+1]` is '?', update `put` to be the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`
- If `arr[i+1]` is '?', update `vis` to contain only one unique value 'put'
- Update the length of `vis` to be 1
- Ensure `len(vis)` is not equal to 2

State: **`arr[i+1]` is valid, `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` is set correctly, all elements in `arr` between index `i+1` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i+1]` or '?', the length of `vis` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `i` is within the bounds of the list**
