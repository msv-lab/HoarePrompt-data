According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, `k`, and `j`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the value of `arr[j]` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`, `put` is not affected, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 1 if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`, `k` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i`, `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `k` and `j` must be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **`arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the value of `arr[j]` if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`, `put` is not affected, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 1 if `arr[j]` is not equal to '?`, for the loop to execute again `arr` has a length greater than `j`, `k` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `arr[j]` is not equal to '?'**
