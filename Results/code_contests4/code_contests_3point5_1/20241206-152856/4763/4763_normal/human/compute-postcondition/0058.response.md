Output State: **`arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i']`, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by `k`, if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', the element at index `j` in `arr` remains as '?'. After the execution of the if else block, the program will return False.**
