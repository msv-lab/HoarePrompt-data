Postcondition: ***`vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr)`. The length of `vis` is not equal to 2. If the length of `vis` is equal to 1, all elements in `arr` will be equal to `put`, `vis` will contain only `put`, `i` is less than `len(arr)`, `j` is `len(arr)`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2, only one element is present in `vis`, `put` is the only element present in `vis`.***
