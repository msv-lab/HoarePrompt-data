According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr` and `k`. If the length of `arr` is still greater than 1 and `k` is still a positive value, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still have a length of at least 1 and `k` must still be a positive value.
State: **`put` is updated to be the first unique non-'?' value in `vis`, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, for the loop to execute another time `arr` has a length of at least 1 and `k` is a positive value**
