Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of list `arr` is used as a key to access and increment the corresponding value in the dictionary `dic`. Since `i` is 2 and `arr` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific key to access. Therefore, the values in the dictionary `dic` are not updated. The loop will execute for the second time as `k` is 2. 
Output State: **`dic` is {'1': 2, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is 2, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
