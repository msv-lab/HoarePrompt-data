Postcondition: ***`arr[i]` is valid, `vis` is a non-empty list, `put` is set correctly, `i` is within the bounds of the list, `k` is greater than 0, the length of `vis` is at least 1. All elements in `arr` between index `i` and `len(arr)` are either equal to `arr[i]` or '?'. If any element is '?', it will be updated to be the same as `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to '?', `vis` contains only one unique value which is 'put', `put` remains the same as the last unique non-'?' value in `arr`, `i` is not affected, the length of `vis` is 1, the length of `arr` remains the same, `k` is greater than 0, and `len(vis)` is not equal to 2.***
