The function func_5 does not accept any parameters and iterates over elements in `args`, writing their string representations to the output `file` separated by the value of `sep`. It then writes the value of 'end' from `kwargs` to `file` and flushes the file if the 'flush' key is present and set to True in `kwargs`.
