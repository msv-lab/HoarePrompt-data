Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The functions are designed to handle the conditions specified in the problem statement, such as creating a k-balanced bitstring by replacing '?' characters with either 0 or 1. The annotations provide examples and edge cases, but upon inspection, the code seems to cover all those scenarios correctly. The output of the program aligns with the expected results for the given inputs, indicating that the code is correct.
