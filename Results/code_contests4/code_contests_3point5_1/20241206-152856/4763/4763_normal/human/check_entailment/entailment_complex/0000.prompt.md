You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called k-balanced if every substring of size k of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters (k/2 of each).

You are given an integer k and a string s which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a k-balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in s with either 0 or 1.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) — the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring.

The next line contains the string s (|s| = n). It is given that s consists of only 0, 1, and ?.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print YES if we can replace every ? in s with 0 or 1 such that the resulting bitstring is k-balanced, or NO if it is not possible.

Note

For the first test case, the string is already a 4-balanced bitstring.

For the second test case, the string can be transformed into 101.

For the fourth test case, the string can be transformed into 0110.

For the fifth test case, the string can be transformed into 1100110.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and k is even. The string s of length n consists of only 0, 1, and ?.**
def func_1(n):
    return set(reduce(list.__add__, ([i, n // i] for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5
    ) + 1) if n % i == 0)))
    #The program returns the set of divisors of 'n' that are factors of 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and k is even. The string s of length n consists of only 0, 1, and ?. The function then returns the set of divisors of 'n' that are factors of 'n'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.**
def func_2(n):
    arr = [1] * n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                arr[j] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least 5, `arr` is an array of length at least 5 with values [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, ..., 2], `i` is `n
    return arr
    #The program returns the array 'arr' of length at least 5 with values [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, ..., 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and generates an array `arr` of length at least 5 filled with specific values. The function populates the array based on a certain pattern, where each element represents a factor of its index. The pattern is implemented using nested loops, assigning factors to corresponding elements in the array. The function then returns the generated array `arr`. It is important to note that the pattern generation logic is not explicitly defined in the annotations, so the specific pattern followed by the array values is not detailed.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string s of length n composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?.**
def func_3(arr, k):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != '?':
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                if arr[j] != arr[i] and arr[j] != '?':
                    return False
                if arr[j] == '?':
                    arr[j] = arr[i]
        else:
            vis = set([])

            if len(vis) == 2:
                return False
            if len(vis) == 1:
                put = list(vis)[0]
                for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                    arr[j] = put
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables will depend on the initial state of the input list arr. If the loop does not execute, the values of n, k, and s will remain the same as the initial state. If the loop executes, the elements of arr will be updated according to the conditions outlined in the loop code. All elements in arr between index i and len(arr) will either be equal to arr[i] or '?'. If arr[i] is not equal to '?', then all elements in arr will be updated to be the same as arr[i]. If arr[i] is '?', then all elements in arr will be updated to be the same as the last unique non-'?' value in arr. Additionally, if len(vis) is equal to 1, all elements in arr will be updated to be the same as the only element in vis. If len(vis) is equal to 2, the program will return False.
    dic = {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}
    for i in range(k):
        dic[arr[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dic` is {'1': k, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is k-1, `k` is a non-negative integer
    if (dic['1'] != dic['0'] and dic['?'] != abs(dic['1'] - dic['0'])) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`dic` is {'1': k, '0': 0, '?': 0}, `i` is k-1, `k` is a non-negative integer. The condition (dic['1'] != dic['0'] and dic['?'] != abs(dic['1'] - dic['0'])) is false
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k, and a string s of length n composed of 0, 1, and ?, and `k`, an even integer. The function iterates through the elements of arr and updates them based on certain conditions. It returns False in multiple cases specified by the annotations, and finally returns True if none of the previous conditions are met. The function has multiple return points based on the input parameters and the conditions checked during execution.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(input())
        
        if not func_3(arr, k):
            func_5('NO')
        else:
            func_5('YES')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop, `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last input split, `arr` will contain the list of characters from the last input, and the function `func_5` will be called with either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the return value of `func_3(arr, k)` for the last input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` iterates over a range of inputs, where for each iteration, it reads input values for `n`, `k`, and a list of characters `arr`. It then calls `func_3` with `arr` and `k`, and based on the return value, calls `func_5` with either 'NO' or 'YES'. The function does not have specific input constraints or return values.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is ' ', `file` is updated with the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is ' ', `file` is updated with the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs` and its value is True, then it is removed from `kwargs`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 does not accept any parameters and iterates over elements in `args`, writing their string representations to the output `file` separated by the value of `sep`. It then writes the value of 'end' from `kwargs` to `file` and flushes the file if the 'flush' key is present and set to True in `kwargs`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of test cases, y is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string s of length n composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?.**
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'x' and 'y', where 'y' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_6 accepts two parameters, x and y, where x is an integer representing the number of test cases and y is a list of tuples. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'x' and 'y' iteratively until 'y' becomes 0, and then returns the GCD.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
