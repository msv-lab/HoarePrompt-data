The function `func_4` iterates over a range of inputs, where for each iteration, it reads input values for `n`, `k`, and a list of characters `arr`. It then calls `func_3` with `arr` and `k`, and based on the return value, calls `func_5` with either 'NO' or 'YES'. The function does not have specific input constraints or return values.
