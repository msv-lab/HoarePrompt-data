Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The function `func_3` is supposed to determine whether a given bitstring can be transformed into a k-balanced bitstring by replacing '?' characters with either 0 or 1. However, there are several issues in the implementation that prevent it from working correctly for all potential cases:

1. The function `func_3` does not handle the case where the input string cannot be transformed into a k-balanced bitstring. It only returns `False` when it encounters a specific condition, but there might be other cases where the transformation is not possible.

2. The function does not consider all possible combinations of replacing '?' characters with 0 or 1 to make the string k-balanced. It only checks for immediate neighbors in the string and does not explore all possible transformations.

3. The function assumes that the input string can always be transformed into a k-balanced bitstring, which may not always be the case. There could be scenarios where the transformation is not possible even after replacing all '?' characters.

Due to these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
