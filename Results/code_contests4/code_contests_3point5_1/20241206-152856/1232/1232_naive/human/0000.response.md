Correctness: **False**

In the provided program, there seems to be an issue in calculating the minimum number of bullets required to kill all the monsters. The calculation logic is not handling the case when explosions trigger a chain reaction of explosions. This can lead to incorrect results for certain test cases.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input
```
1
3
7 15
2 14
5 3
```

Expected Output
```
6
```

By analyzing the program, it can be seen that it does not consider the scenario where an explosion from one monster leads to a chain reaction of explosions, affecting the number of bullets required. This oversight can lead to incorrect results for cases where explosions trigger multiple chain reactions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
