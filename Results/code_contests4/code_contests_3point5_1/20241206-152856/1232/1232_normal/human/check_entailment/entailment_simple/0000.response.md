Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of bullets required to kill all monsters as described in the problem description. It iterates through each monster, calculates the damage required to kill each monster considering the explosion effect, and keeps track of the minimum number of bullets required.

The program handles all test cases within the given constraints and correctly calculates the output for each test case. It follows the logic described in the problem description and ensures that the explosions are handled properly.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
