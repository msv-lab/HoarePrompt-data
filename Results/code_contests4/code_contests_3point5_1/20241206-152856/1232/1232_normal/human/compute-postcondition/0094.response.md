Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the elements of `inp[_i]` after splitting it. The value of `_i` is increased by 1 before the assignment, so the updated value of `_i` is used to access the correct element in `inp`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `monsters` contains the list `cur`, `mnShots` is the value of `dam`, `start` is updated, `N` is greater than 0, `_i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`monsters` contains the list `cur`, `mnShots` is the value of `dam`, `start` is updated, `N` is greater than 0, `_i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 1**
