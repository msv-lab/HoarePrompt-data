Output State: **`stdin` remains a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` remains an empty `BytesIO()` object, `res` contains the calculated value of `mnShots + start`, `inp` contains the input read from `stdin`, `T` remains the integer value of the first line of `inp`, `_i` is incremented by `N+1`, `t` is incremented by 1, `N` is assigned the integer value of the last line of `inp`, `monsters` contains the list of all `cur` values, `mnShots` is the sum of all `dam` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `start` is the minimum of all `start` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `dam` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the previous element in `monsters`.**
