Example Answer:
The minimum value between `start` and `monsters[0][0] - dam` is assigned to `start`. The value of `monsters[0][0] - dam` is calculated as the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the `n - 1`th element of `monsters`. The value of `dam` is assigned the maximum between 0 and `monsters[0][0] - monsters[-1][1]`. Finally, `mnShots` is increased by the value of `dam`. Other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `monsters` contains the updated list with all the appended `cur` lists, `mnShots` is the sum of all `dam` values calculated during each iteration, `start` is the updated minimum value, `N` is the total number of iterations, `_i` is increased by `N`, `n` is equal to `N`, `dam` is assigned the maximum between 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the `n - 1`th element of `monsters`, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`.
Output State: **`monsters` contains the updated list with all the appended `cur` lists, `mnShots` is the sum of all `dam` values calculated during each iteration, `start` is the updated minimum value, `N` is the total number of iterations, `_i` is increased by `N`, `n` is equal to `N`, `dam` is assigned the maximum between 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the `n - 1`th element of `monsters`, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`**
