Example Answer:
The list `res` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` is an empty `BytesIO()` object, `res` is an empty list.
Output State: **`stdin` is a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` is an empty `BytesIO()` object, `res` is an empty list**
