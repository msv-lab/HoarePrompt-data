Output State: **After the execution of the if-else block, the program variables are as follows: `stdin` is a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` is an empty `BytesIO()` object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` contains the input read from `stdin`, `T` is the integer value of the first line of `inp`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `t` is 0, `N` is the integer value of `inp[_i]`, `monsters` contains the map object `cur`, `mnShots` is increased by the maximum of 0 and the difference between `cur[0]` and `monsters[N - 1][1]`, `start` is assigned the minimum value between the current `start` and `cur[0] - dam`, where `dam` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `cur[0]` and `monsters[N - 1][1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be less than `N`, `cur` is assigned the map object converted to integers from `inp[_i].split()`**
