Output State: **`stdin` is a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` is an empty `BytesIO()` object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` contains the input read from `stdin`, `T` is the integer value of the first line of `inp`, `_i` is incremented by 2, `t` is 0, `N` is the integer value of `inp[_i] + 1`, `monsters` contains the map object `cur`, `mnShots` is increased by the maximum of 0 and the difference between `cur[0]` and `monsters[N - 1][1]`, `start` is assigned the minimum value between the current `start` and `cur[0] - dam`, `cur` is assigned the map object converted to integers from `inp[_i].split()`, and `monsters` list is appended with the `cur` map object. Additionally, if `n > 0`, `dam` is recalculated and `mnShots` is updated by adding `dam`. `monsters` list is appended with the `cur` map object, `dam` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `cur[0]` and `monsters[N - 1][1]`, `mnShots` is further increased by `dam`.**
