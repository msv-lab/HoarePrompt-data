Example Answer:
`mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `monsters` contains the list `cur`, `mnShots` is the value of `dam`, `start` is the maximum possible integer value, `N` is greater than 0, `_i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`monsters` contains the list `cur`, `mnShots` is the value of `dam`, `start` is the maximum possible integer value, `N` is greater than 0, `_i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
