Example Answer:
`start` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the maximum between 0 and the difference between the first element of the current sublist and the second element of the `(n - 1)`th element of `monsters`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `monsters` contains the updated list with the newly appended `cur`, `mnShots` is increased by the value of `dam`, `start` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the calculated value, `N` is greater than 0, `_i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `dam` is assigned the maximum between 0 and the calculated difference, `cur` is assigned the result of mapping integers from the input at index `_i`.
