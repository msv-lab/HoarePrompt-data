Example Answer:
`stdout` is assigned an empty `BytesIO()` object. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` is an empty `BytesIO()` object.
Output State: **`stdin` is a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` is an empty `BytesIO()` object**
