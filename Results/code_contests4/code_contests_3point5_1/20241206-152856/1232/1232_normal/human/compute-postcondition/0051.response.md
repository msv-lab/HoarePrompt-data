Output State: **`stdin` remains a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` remains an empty `BytesIO()` object, `res` contains the calculated value of `mnShots + start`, `inp` contains the input read from `stdin`, `T` remains the integer value of the first line of `inp`, `_i` is incremented by `N+1`, `t` is incremented by 1, `N` is assigned the integer value of the last line of `inp`, `monsters` contains the list `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is `maxint`, `dam` is not defined yet, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `cur` contains the mapped integer values from `inp[_i].split()`**
