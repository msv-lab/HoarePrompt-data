Postcondition: ***`stdin` is a binary stream created from standard input, `stdout` is an empty `BytesIO()` object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` is assigned the value of `stdin.readlines()`, `T` is assigned the integer value of the first line of input stored in `inp`, `_i` is incremented by 1, `t` is 0, `N` is assigned the integer value of `inp[_i]`, `monsters` contains the map object `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `start` is assigned the maximum integer value available in the system, `cur` is a map object containing integers extracted from `inp[_i].split()`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, and `n` is greater than 0***
