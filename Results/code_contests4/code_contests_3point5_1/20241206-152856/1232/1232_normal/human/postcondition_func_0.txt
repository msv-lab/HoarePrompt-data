The function func reads input from standard input, processes the data to calculate certain values for each iteration, and then writes the results to standard output. It iterates through a range of values, performs calculations on the input data, and stores the results in a list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it seems to be missing error handling for cases where the input format is incorrect or if there are issues reading from standard input.
