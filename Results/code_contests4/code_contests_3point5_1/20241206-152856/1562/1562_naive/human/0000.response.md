Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input dataset correctly and processes each dataset by iterating through each square. It correctly identifies the islands by recursively checking neighboring squares and marking them as visited. The program counts the number of islands correctly and outputs the result for each dataset. Additionally, the program handles the end of input correctly by breaking out of the loop when there is no more input. Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and works as expected for all potential cases.
