Example Answer:
`nextx` is assigned the value `x + dx[i]`, where `x` is the current position and `dx[i]` is the change in the x-coordinate based on the direction `i`. The values of `x` and `dx[i]` are not provided, so the exact value of `nextx` cannot be determined. The value at `g[y][x]` and `nexty` are not affected by this statement.
Output State: **The value at g[y][x] is set to '0' for the loop to execute 4 times, `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`.**
