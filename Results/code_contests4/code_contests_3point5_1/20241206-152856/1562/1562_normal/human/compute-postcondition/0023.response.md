Example Answer:
`nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`. The values of `y` and `dy[i]` are unknown, so the exact value of `nexty` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, if `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', then `visited[nexty][nextx]` becomes 1. Otherwise, there are no changes in the values of the variables. For the loop to execute a fifth time, `i` needs to be less than 4.
