Example Answer:
The function `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is called with the parameters `nexty` and `nextx`. The values of `nexty` and `nextx` are passed to the function, but their specific values are not given. The function may have an impact on the program, but without knowing the details of the function implementation, we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **Unknown, as the specific impact of func_2 on the program is not provided**
