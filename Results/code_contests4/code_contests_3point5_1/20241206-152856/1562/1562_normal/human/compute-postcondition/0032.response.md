The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `y` and `x`, which are integers representing the row and column indices of the plan view grid, respectively. After executing the function body, there are two possible return values based on the following conditions:

Case 1: The program returns 0.
Case 2: The program returns the value 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integer parameters `y` and `x`, and based on certain conditions, return either 0 or 1.
