Postcondition: ***The value at g[y][x] is set to '0' for the loop to execute 4 times. `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`. If `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns False, the loop continues to execute without any changes in the variables or the program state. In addition, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is equal to 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is equal to '1'***
