According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `visited`, and `g`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1'. After the execution of the if else block, `visited[nexty][nextx]` becomes 1 if `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1'. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than 4.
State: **After the execution of the if else block, if `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', then `visited[nexty][nextx]` becomes 1. Otherwise, there are no changes in the values of the variables. For the loop to execute a fifth time, `i` needs to be less than 4**
