Example Answer:
`nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`. The value of `y` and `dy[i]` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `nexty`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at g[y][x] is set to '0' for the loop to execute 4 times, `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`.
Output State: **The value at g[y][x] is set to '0' for the loop to execute 4 times, `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`**
