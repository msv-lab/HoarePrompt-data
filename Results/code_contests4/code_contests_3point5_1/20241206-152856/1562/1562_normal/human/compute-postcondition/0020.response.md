Example Answer:
`func_2(nexty, nextx)` is called, but the impact on the program depends on the implementation of `func_2` and its effect on the variables. The value of `visited[nexty][nextx]` remains 1 until `func_2` executes, which may or may not change it. Therefore, the Output State is: `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1.
Output State: **`visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1**
