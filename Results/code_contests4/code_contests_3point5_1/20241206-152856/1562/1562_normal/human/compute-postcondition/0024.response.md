Example Answer:
`nextx` is assigned the value `x + dx[i]`, where `dx` is a list of values and `i` is an index. The value of `x` is unknown, so the value of `nextx` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes in variables except for `nextx` being assigned a new value based on `x + dx[i]`.
Output State: **No changes in variables except for `nextx` being assigned a new value based on `x + dx[i]`**
