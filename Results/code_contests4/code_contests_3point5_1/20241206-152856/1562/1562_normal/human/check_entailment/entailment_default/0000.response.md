# Your task:

Given the problem description and the provided code, let's first analyze if the code aligns with the problem description and if there are any potential edge cases that are not handled.

The code consists of two functions to determine the number of islands in a grid of 12x12 squares. The first function, `func_1`, checks if the given coordinates are within the boundaries of the grid. The second function, `func_2`, processes the grid to count the number of islands. It recursively explores adjacent squares to mark and count islands.

Now, let's see if the output hints agree with the code and if they provide any additional insight into potential cases that the code might not handle correctly.

Output hints:
- The function `func_1` ensures that the input coordinates are valid for the 12x12 grid.
- The function `func_2` processes the grid to count the number of islands by recursively exploring adjacent squares.

Based on the code and the output hints, it seems that the code aligns with the problem description and that there are no apparent cases where the code does not follow the specifications provided.

Therefore, considering that the code correctly implements the logic to count the number of islands in a grid as described in the problem statement and the output hints agree with the code, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **True**.
