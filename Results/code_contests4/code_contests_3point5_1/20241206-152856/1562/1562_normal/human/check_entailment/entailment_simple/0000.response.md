Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, that work together to determine the number of islands in a given plan view grid. The program correctly identifies each dataset as a 12x12 grid where black squares are represented by '1' and white squares are represented by '0'. The func_1 function checks if the coordinates (y, x) are within the bounds of the grid, and func_2 recursively explores the grid to identify islands by marking visited squares and counting them as islands.

The program correctly follows the problem description by iterating through each dataset, identifying islands, and outputting the number of islands for each dataset. The program handles the case where two black squares touch each other vertically or horizontally to form a continuous island.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description as required.
