Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` is intended to recursively search for islands in the grid based on the rules provided. However, the for loop inside the function does not seem to properly update the state of the variables or track the connected black squares in a continuous island. This could lead to incorrect island counting as the function may not properly identify all connected black squares.

An example where the code may fail to produce the correct output is when there are multiple islands that are not fully connected. The function may not be able to correctly identify and count these separate islands due to the limitations in the loop logic.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it may not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description.
