The function func_2 accepts two integer parameters `y` and `x`, representing row and column indices of a grid. It checks if the value at position g[y][x] is '0'. If so, it returns 0. If the value is not '0', it updates g[y][x] to '0' and iterates through neighboring grid positions. If a neighboring position meets certain conditions, the function recursively calls itself on that position. The function always returns 1 at the end. The loop inside the function does not seem to have any impact on changing the initial state of the variables, potentially leading to a missing functionality.
