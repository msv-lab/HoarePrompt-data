#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `y` and `x`, representing coordinates on a 12x12 grid. It returns True if the coordinates are within the grid boundaries (0 to 11 inclusive) and False otherwise. The function ensures that the input coordinates are valid for the 12x12 grid.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will remain the same as their initial values. The loop does not seem to have any impact on changing the initial state of the variables.
    return 1
    #The program returns the value 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts two integer parameters `y` and `x`, representing row and column indices of a grid. It checks if the value at position g[y][x] is '0'. If so, it returns 0. If the value is not '0', it updates g[y][x] to '0' and iterates through neighboring grid positions. If a neighboring position meets certain conditions, the function recursively calls itself on that position. The function always returns 1 at the end. The loop inside the function does not seem to have any impact on changing the initial state of the variables, potentially leading to a missing functionality.
