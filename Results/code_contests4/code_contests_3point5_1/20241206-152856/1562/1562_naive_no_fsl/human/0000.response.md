Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input data representing the plan view of the terrain and counts the number of islands present. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the connected black squares and mark them as visited to avoid counting them multiple times. The program handles multiple datasets separated by a blank line and terminates when there is no more input. The DFS function (`func_2`) correctly explores the adjacent squares and marks them as visited, ensuring that each island is counted only once. The code structure and logic align with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
