Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly implement the rules of the game as described in the problem description. It does not consider the condition that the total number of cards dealt should be 20 or less and greater than the opponent's total number. The program only checks if the probability of the total being 20 or less is 50% or more when one more card is drawn.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases based on the problem description.
