Correctness: **True**

The program accurately follows the problem description. It reads the input consisting of the numbers on the cards and calculates the probability of the total being 20 or less when drawing one more card. It then outputs 'YES' if the probability is 50% or greater, and 'NO' otherwise. The implementation correctly considers all the rules of the game described in the problem statement and makes the decision to draw a card based on the probability condition specified. Hence, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
