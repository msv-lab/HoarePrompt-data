Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The code calculates the sum of the two given cards and then calculates the number of cards that can be added to the sum without exceeding 20. If this number is greater than 3, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. However, this logic is incorrect as it does not consider all possible outcomes.

For example, if the sum of the two given cards is already 17, then there are only 3 possible cards that can be added without exceeding 20 (namely 1, 2, and 3). In this case, the code would still output 'YES' even though it should be 'NO' according to the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not correctly determine if there is a 50% or greater probability that the total will be 20 or less when drawing one more card, making the correctness **False**.
