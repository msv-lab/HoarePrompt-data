Example Answer: 
The list `c` is assigned the integer values extracted from the input line after splitting it. The values of C1, C2, and C3 are unknown but they are guaranteed to be integers between 1 and 10. After execution, `c` will contain the integer values extracted from the input line. Therefore, the Output State is: C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line.
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line**
