According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines to read from stdin. Since we are given the initial state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that there is at least one line to read from stdin. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, where 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10, and there is at least one line to read from stdin.
State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, where 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10, there is at least one line to read from stdin**
