Example Answer:
The list comprehension creates a new list `cards` containing numbers from 1 to 10 that are not present in the list `c`. The initial state indicates that C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, and `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line. After executing the code, the `cards` list will contain the numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in list `c`. 
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line, `cards` is a list of numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`**
