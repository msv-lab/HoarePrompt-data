Since the state at the end of the previous iteration depends on the value of `e` calculated based on the given initial state, we need to analyze the relationship between `e` and any other variables that determine the continuation of the loop.

Without specific information on how `e` affects the loop execution, it is difficult to determine the exact adjustments needed for the next iteration. The state adjustments would depend on the specific conditions that involve `e` within the loop.

In order to provide a detailed answer, we would require more information on how `e` influences the loop execution and any other variables involved in the loop condition.
