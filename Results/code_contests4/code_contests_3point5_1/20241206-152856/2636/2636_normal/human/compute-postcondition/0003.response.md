Example Answer:
`c1c2` is assigned the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`, which represents the sum of the numbers on the first two cards. The values of `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are unknown. The output state is: C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line, `cards` is a list of numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`, and `c1c2` is the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`.
Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line, `cards` is a list of numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`, and `c1c2` is the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`**
