Output State: **C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, all variables `c`, `cards`, `c1c2`, and `e` have values based on the input and loop calculations. The loop will print 'YES' if the count `e` of numbers in `cards` that when added to `c1c2` are less than or equal to 20 is greater than 3, otherwise it will print 'NO'.**
