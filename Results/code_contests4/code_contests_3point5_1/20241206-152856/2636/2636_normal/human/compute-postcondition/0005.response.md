Example Answer:
The code checks if the value of `e` is greater than 3, and if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are integers representing the numbers on the cards, `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line, `cards` is a list of numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`, `c1c2` is the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`, and `e` is the count of numbers in `cards` that when added to `c1c2` are less than or equal to 20. 
Output State: **`C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are integers representing the numbers on the cards, `c` is a list containing the extracted integer values from the input line, `cards` is a list of numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`, `c1c2` is the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`, `e` is the count of numbers in `cards` that when added to `c1c2` are less than or equal to 20**
