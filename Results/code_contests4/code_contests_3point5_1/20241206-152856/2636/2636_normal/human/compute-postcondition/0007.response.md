Example Answer:
The list `c` is created by extracting integer values from the input line. The variables `c1c2` is updated to be the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`. The list `cards` is updated to contain numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`. The variable `e` is updated to count the numbers in `cards` that when added to `c1c2` are less than or equal to 20.
Output State: **`C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are integers, `c` contains the extracted integer values from the input line, `cards` is a list of numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`, `c1c2` is the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`, `e` is the count of numbers in `cards` that when added to `c1c2` are less than or equal to 20**
