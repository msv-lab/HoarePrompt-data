Example Answer:
The variable `e` is assigned the sum of the expression `int(i + c1c2 <= 20)` for each `i` in `cards`. The value of `e` depends on the contents of the `cards` list as well as the value of `c1c2`. Without knowing the initial state or the content of `line`, the specific output state cannot be determined.
Output State: **Output state cannot be determined without the initial state or the content of `line`.**
