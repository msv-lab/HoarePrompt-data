Example Answer:
`c1c2` is assigned the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`. The values of `c` are extracted integers from the input line. Therefore, `c1c2` will hold the sum of the first two integers in `c`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`C1`, `C2`, and `C3` are integers, `c` contains the extracted integer values from the input line, `cards` is a list of numbers from 1 to 10 excluding those present in `c`, `c1c2` is the sum of the first two elements in the list `c`, `e` is the count of numbers in `cards` that when added to `c1c2` are less than or equal to 20**
