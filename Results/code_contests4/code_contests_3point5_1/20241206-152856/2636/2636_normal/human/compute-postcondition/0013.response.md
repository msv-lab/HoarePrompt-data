Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list `c` by converting each element `s` in the input line split by spaces into an integer using `int(s)`. However, without information on the initial state or the content of `line`, it is challenging to determine the exact output state as it depends on the input provided.
Output State: **Output state cannot be determined without the initial state or the content of `line`.**
