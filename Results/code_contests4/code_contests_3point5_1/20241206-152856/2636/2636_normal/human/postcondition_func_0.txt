The function `func` reads input from stdin, processes the input to determine if certain conditions are met, and prints 'YES' if the count of numbers that can be added to C1 + C2 without exceeding 20 is greater than 3, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates on the integers C1, C2, and C3, where 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10.
