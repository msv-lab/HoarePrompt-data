Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input correctly, processes the trees according to the rules described in the problem, and outputs the maximum number of trees that can be cut down. It iterates through the trees, checking if a tree can be cut down to the left or right based on the conditions provided. The program updates the `cont` variable accordingly and prints the final result.

The program ensures that the fallen trees do not occupy any occupied point and maximizes the number of trees that can be cut down. It follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
