Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input correctly, processes it according to the rules described in the problem description, and outputs the correct result. It iterates over the trees, considering whether each tree can be cut down to the left or right based on the conditions provided. The final output is the maximum number of trees that can be cut down, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
