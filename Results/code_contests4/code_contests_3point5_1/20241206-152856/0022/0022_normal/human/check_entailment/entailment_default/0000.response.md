Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always follow the problem description. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is as follows:
```
5
1 2
2 1
5 10
10 9
19 1
```
The program will output `2` instead of the expected `3`. This is because the program incorrectly assumes that if `p[i] - h[i] > pivout`, then a tree can be felled to the left, which is not always the case. In the given input, the third tree can be felled to the left, occupying the segment [5-10, 5] = [-5, 5], allowing for the fourth tree to be felled to the right and the fifth tree to be felled to the right as well, resulting in 3 trees being felled.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
