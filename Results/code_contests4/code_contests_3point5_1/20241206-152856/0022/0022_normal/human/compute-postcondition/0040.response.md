Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers after the previous iteration, `pivout` and `cont` are updated based on the conditions within the loop. There exists an index `i` such that `p[i] - h[i] <= pivout`. If `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, `cont` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `pivout` is updated to the value of `p[i]`.***
