Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers after the previous iteration, `pivout` and `cont` have been updated based on the loop conditions. The index `i` satisfies the required conditions. If `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, `pivout` is updated to the value of `p[i] + h[i]`, and `cont` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i]` based on the else condition.***
