Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers, `pivout` is the first integer from the updated list `p`. If `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, `cont` is incremented by 1 and `pivout` is equal to `p[i]`. If `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i] + h[i]` and `cont` is incremented by 1. If `p[i] + h[i] >= p[i + 1]`, `pivout` is the value of `p[i]` and `cont` is either 1 if `n` is 1 or 2 if `n` is not 1. There exists an index `i` such that `p[i] - h[i] <= pivout`.***
