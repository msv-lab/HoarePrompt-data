Example Answer:
`p` is appended with the first integer from the input split, which is `e[0]`. The previous value of `p` contains the first integer from the input split. The value of `h` is not affected as it only contains the integer value at index 1 of `e`. The map object `e` contains integers from the input split. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer from the input split and `e`, `h` contains the integer value at index 1 of `e`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer from the input split and `e`, `h` contains the integer value at index 1 of `e`**
