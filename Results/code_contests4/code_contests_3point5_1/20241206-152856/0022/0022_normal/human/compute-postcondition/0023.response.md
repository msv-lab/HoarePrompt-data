Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers, `pivout` is the first integer from the updated list `p`, if `n` is equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 2. In addition, `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`***
