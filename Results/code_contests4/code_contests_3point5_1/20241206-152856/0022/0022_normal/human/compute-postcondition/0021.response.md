Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains a list of the first integers from each input split, `h` contains a list of the second integers from each input split, `pivout` is the first integer from the list `p`. If `n` is equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 2.***
