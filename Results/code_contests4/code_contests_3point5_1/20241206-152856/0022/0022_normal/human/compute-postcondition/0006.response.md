Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of the map object `e` is appended to the list `h`. Since `e` is a map object containing integers from the input split, and the input is split into integers, the value at index 1 of `e` is an integer. Therefore, after execution, the list `h` will contain the integer value at index 1 of `e`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer from the input split, `h` contains the integer value at index 1 of `e`, `e` is a map object containing integers from the input split.**
