Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of list `e` is appended to list `h`. The previous values of `e` and `h` are known, so the value at index 1 of `e` is added to `h`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer from the input split, `e`, `h` contains the integer value at index 1 of `e`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains the first integer from the input split, `e`, `h` contains the integer value at index 1 of `e`**
