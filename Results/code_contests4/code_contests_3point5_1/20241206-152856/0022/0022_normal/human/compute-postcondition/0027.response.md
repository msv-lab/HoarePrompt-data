Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers, `pivout` is the first integer from the updated list `p`, if `n` is equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 2. Additionally, there exists an index `i` such that `p[i] - h[i] <= pivout`. Moreover, after entering the if condition `(p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1])`, the relationship `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]` holds true.***
