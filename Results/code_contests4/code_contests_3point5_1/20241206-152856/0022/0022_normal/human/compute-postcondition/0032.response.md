Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers. If `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i] + h[i]`, `cont` is incremented by 1. If `p[i] + h[i] >= p[i + 1]`, `pivout` is the value of `p[i]`, `cont` is either 1 if `n` is 1 or 2 if `n` is not 1. Additionally, there exists an index `i` such that `p[i] - h[i] <= pivout`***
