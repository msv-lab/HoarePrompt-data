Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers, `pivout` is assigned the value of `p[i] + h[i]`, `cont` is incremented by 1 based on the specified conditions, `i` such that `p[i] - h[i] <= pivout`, and the relationship `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]` holds true.**
