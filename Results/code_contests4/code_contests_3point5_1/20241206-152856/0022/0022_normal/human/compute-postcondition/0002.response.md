Example Answer:
`h` is assigned an empty list. The value of `n` is the input provided by the user, and `p` is an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input value provided by the user, `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is the input value provided by the user, `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list**
