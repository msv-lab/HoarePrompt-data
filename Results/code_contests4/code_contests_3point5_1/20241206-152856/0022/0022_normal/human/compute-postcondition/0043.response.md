The value of `cont` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers after the previous iteration, `pivout` and `cont` have been updated based on the loop conditions, the index `i` satisfies the required conditions, and `cont` is incremented by 1.
