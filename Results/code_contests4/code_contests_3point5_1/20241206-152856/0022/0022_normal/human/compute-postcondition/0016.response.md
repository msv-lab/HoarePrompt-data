Example Answer:
`pivout` is assigned the value of the first integer from the list `p`. Since `p` contains the first integers from each input split, and `p[0]` is the first integer, `pivout` is assigned that value. The values of `n` and `h` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains a list of the first integers from each input split, `h` contains a list of the second integers from each input split, `pivout` is the first integer from the list `p`**
