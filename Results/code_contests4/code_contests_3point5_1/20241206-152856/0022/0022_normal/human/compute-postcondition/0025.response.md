Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` contains at least 3 elements, `h` contains a list of the second integers, `pivout` is the first integer from the updated list `p`, if `n` is equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 2, `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, `cont` is incremented by 1, `pivout` is equal to `p[i]`**
