The function reads input, processes it to determine certain conditions based on the input values, and finally prints the calculated result `cont`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it performs operations on the input lists `p` and `h` to calculate the final value of `cont` based on specific conditions within the loops.
