Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description. 

One potential case where the program fails is when there are trees such that cutting them down in a certain order would allow cutting down more trees than the provided program outputs. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2
2 1
5 10
10 9
19 1
```
The correct output should be 4 as follows:
- Fell the 1st tree to the left — now it occupies segment [-1;1]
- Fell the 2nd tree to the right — now it occupies segment [2;3]
- Leave the 3rd tree — it occupies point 5
- Fell the 4th tree to the left — now it occupies segment [1;10]
- Fell the 5th tree to the right — now it occupies segment [19;20]

But the provided program outputs 3 which is incorrect.
