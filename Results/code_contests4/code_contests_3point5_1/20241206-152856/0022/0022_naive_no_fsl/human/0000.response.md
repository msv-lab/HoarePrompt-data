Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for the number of trees and their coordinates and heights. It then iterates through the trees and calculates the maximum number of trees that can be cut down based on the given rules. The logic in the program seems correct as it checks if a tree can be cut down to the left or right based on the previous and next trees' positions. It updates the pivot point accordingly to keep track of the last tree that was cut down. The output of the program is the maximum number of trees that can be cut down.

The program seems to follow the problem description and handles the cases where a tree can be cut down to maximize the number of trees cut.
