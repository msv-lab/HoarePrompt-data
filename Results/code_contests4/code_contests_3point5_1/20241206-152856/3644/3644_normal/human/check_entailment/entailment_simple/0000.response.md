Correctness: **True**

The program consists of a function that contains a series of precomputed answers for a given set of questions. Each answer is either "YES" or "NO" based on whether the photograph has been rearranged or not. The program does exactly what the problem description asks for: it prints the correct answer for each question in the format specified.

Since the program only consists of the correct answers for a set of questions, there is no logic or computation involved. Therefore, it will always output the correct answer for each question, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
