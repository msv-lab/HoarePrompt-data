Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of a function `func` that contains a series of "YES" and "NO" strings. These strings represent the expected output for a series of questions based on the description provided in the problem statement. The function does not accept any parameters but internally handles the values of `q`, `h`, `w`, and `aij`.

The comments in the program clearly indicate that the purpose of the function is to provide an answer of "YES" if the photograph has been rearranged and "NO" otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, where the program is expected to output "YES" or "NO" based on whether the top and bottom halves of the photograph have been swapped or not.

Since the annotated program provides the correct output based on the problem description for all potential cases, it can be considered correct.
