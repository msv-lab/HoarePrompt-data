Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not handle the scenario where the topmost rows have been moved to the bottom of the picture. The code only checks for the brightness of pixels in a row-wise manner, but it does not check if the top and bottom halves of the photograph have been swapped or not. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this problem.
