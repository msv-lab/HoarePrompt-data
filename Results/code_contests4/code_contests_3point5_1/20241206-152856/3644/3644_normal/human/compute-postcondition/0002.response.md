Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It internally handles the values of `q`, `h`, `w`, and `aij`. The function's purpose, based on the annotations, is to perform a certain computation using these values and return a specific output. The exact computation and output are not explicitly defined in the annotations.**
