Output State: The provided Python code snippet contains a series of "YES" and "NO" strings. These strings do not affect any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same:
q is a positive integer, h and w are positive integers such that 1 <= h, w <= 600, and aij is an integer such that 0 <= aij < 256.
