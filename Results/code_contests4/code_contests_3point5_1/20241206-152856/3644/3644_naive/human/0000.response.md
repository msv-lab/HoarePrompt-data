Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The program is already precomputed answers for the sample input, and these precomputed answers are hardcoded in the program. This means that the program does not actually analyze the input images to determine if they have been rearranged or not, it just prints out the precomputed answers. This violates the requirement in the problem description that the program should determine the answers based on the input images.
