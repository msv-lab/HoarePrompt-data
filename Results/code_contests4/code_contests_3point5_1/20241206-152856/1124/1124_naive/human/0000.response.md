Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The main issue is that the logic inside the function `func_1` is incorrect and does not accurately calculate the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold. Additionally, the code is missing the necessary import statement for the `itertools` module which is used in the code. 

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following input:

Input
```
4
1 3 5 6
```

Expected Output
```
2
```

Explanation: The optimal solution in this case is to remove the second hold, resulting in the sequence (1, 5, 6) where the maximum difference between adjacent holds is 2. However, the provided program may not produce the correct output for this input due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
