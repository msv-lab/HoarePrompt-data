Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program is missing the `itertools` library import, which is used in the code. Additionally, the `raw_input()` function should be replaced with `input()` for Python 3 compatibility.

The `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the maximum difference between adjacent holds. The logic inside the function is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum difficulty after removing one hold.

The program also does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It does not consider all possible combinations of holds to be removed and calculate the minimum difficulty correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description.
