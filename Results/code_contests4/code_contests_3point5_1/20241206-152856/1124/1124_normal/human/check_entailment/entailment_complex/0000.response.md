Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It creates a new list `temp` based on the input list `lst` and the indices specified by the input integer `c`. It then calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the `temp` list if both the first and last elements are selected. Otherwise, it returns the value of -1. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description as it accurately determines the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.
