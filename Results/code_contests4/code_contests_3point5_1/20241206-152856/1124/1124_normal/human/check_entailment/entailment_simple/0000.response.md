Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a sublist of the input list `lst` based on the indices specified in the `c` list. If the sublist includes the first and last elements of the original list, it finds the maximum difference and returns it. If the sublist does not include the first and last elements, it returns a large value. This aligns with the requirement of finding the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold as described in the problem statement.
