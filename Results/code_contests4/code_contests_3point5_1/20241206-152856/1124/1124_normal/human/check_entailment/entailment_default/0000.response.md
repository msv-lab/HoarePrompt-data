Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The `func_1` function is supposed to calculate the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the provided list after removing one hold. However, the code does not correctly handle all cases where the first and last elements are not removed. For example, if the second element is removed, the code will not calculate the correct maximum difference. Additionally, the code has redundant lines and unnecessary repetition, which can be optimized for better performance and readability.
