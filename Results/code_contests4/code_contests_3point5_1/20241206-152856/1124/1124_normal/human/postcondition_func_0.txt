The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `c`. It then creates a new list `temp` by selecting elements from `lst` based on the indices specified by the elements in list `c`. If both 0 and n - 1 are present in list `c`, the function calculates and returns the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the `temp` list. If 0 and n - 1 are not both present in list `c`, the function returns the value of 'awk', which is initially -1. If the conditions of the if statements are not satisfied, the function returns 10000000000.
