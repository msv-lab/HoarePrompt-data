#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(lst, c):
    temp = []
    for i in c:
        temp.append(lst[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` contains elements of list `lst` at indices specified by the elements in list `c`
    awk = -1
    if (0 in c and n - 1 in c) :
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            awk = max(awk, temp[i] - temp[i - 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `awk` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the `temp` list.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`awk` is assigned the value -1. If 0 is present in list c and n - 1 is present in list c, then `awk` becomes the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the `temp` list. Otherwise, `awk` retains its initial value of -1.
    if (awk == -1) :
        return 10000000000
        #The program returns 10000000000
    else :
        return awk
        #The program returns the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the 'temp' list if 0 and n - 1 are present in list c, otherwise it returns the value of 'awk' which is not equal to -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `c`. It then creates a new list `temp` by selecting elements from `lst` based on the indices specified by the elements in list `c`. If both 0 and n - 1 are present in list `c`, the function calculates and returns the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the `temp` list. If 0 and n - 1 are not both present in list `c`, the function returns the value of 'awk', which is initially -1. If the conditions of the if statements are not satisfied, the function returns 10000000000.
