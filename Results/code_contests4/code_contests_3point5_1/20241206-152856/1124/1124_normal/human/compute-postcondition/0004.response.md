Example Answer:
`temp` is appended with the next element of list `lst` at index `i`. The loop will execute again if `c` contains more elements. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`temp` contains the next element of list `lst` at index `i`, for the loop to execute again `c` must contain more elements**
