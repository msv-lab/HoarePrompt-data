Example Answer:
`temp` appends the element of `lst` at index `i`. The loop can execute again if `c` contains more elements. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains the next element of list `lst` at index `i`, for the loop to execute again `c` must contain more elements.
Output State: **`temp` contains the next element of list `lst` at index `i`, for the loop to execute again `c` must contain more elements**
