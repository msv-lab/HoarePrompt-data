According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If there are more elements in `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains the next element of list `lst` at index `i`, and for the loop to execute again, `c` must contain more elements. 

State: **`temp` contains the next element of list `lst` at index `i`, for the loop to execute again `c` must contain more elements**
