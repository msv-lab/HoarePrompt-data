According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is a list with at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `temp` is initially an empty list, it needs to be adjusted such that `c` is a list with at least one element for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` should be the first element in the list `c`.

State: **`temp` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the first element in the list `c`**
