According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of temp is greater than 0. The loop iterates over the range of the length of temp, so temp must have elements for the loop to execute. 

State: **`awk` is assigned the value -1, the condition `(0 in c and n - 1 in c)` is true, temp has elements for the loop to execute**
