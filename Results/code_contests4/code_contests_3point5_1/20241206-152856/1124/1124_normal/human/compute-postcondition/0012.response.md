According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `temp` list. If `i` is less than the length of `temp`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `awk` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the difference between consecutive elements in `temp` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 to account for the next element in the `temp` list.
State: **`awk` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the difference between consecutive elements in `temp` list, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be one more than its previous value**
