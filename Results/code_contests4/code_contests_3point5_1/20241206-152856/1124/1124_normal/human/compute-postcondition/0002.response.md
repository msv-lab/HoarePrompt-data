Example Answer:
`temp` appends the element at index `i` from list `lst` to it. Since `i` is the first element in list `c`, it means `i` is the first element in list `lst` as well. Therefore, the element at index 0 of list `lst` is appended to `temp`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`temp` contains the first element of list `lst`**
