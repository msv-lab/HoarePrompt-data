According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If there are more elements in `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains the first element of list `lst`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `c` must contain more elements and `temp` should now contain the next element in the list `lst`.
State: **`temp` contains the next element of list `lst`, for the loop to execute again `c` must contain more elements**
