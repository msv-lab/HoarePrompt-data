Example Answer: 
`awk` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the difference between consecutive elements in the `temp` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be one more than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `awk` is updated based on the maximum value calculation, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`awk` is updated based on the maximum value calculation, `i` is incremented by 1**
