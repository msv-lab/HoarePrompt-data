The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `lst` and `c`. `lst` is a list and `c` is an integer. 

Case 1: If the program is executed, it will return the value 10000000000.

Case 2: If 0 and n - 1 are present in the list `c`, the program will return the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the `lst` list. If 0 and n - 1 are not present in list `c`, the program will return the value of 'awk' which is not equal to -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `c`, and based on the conditions mentioned above, it will return different values.
