Example Answer:
`awk` is updated based on the maximum value calculation between the current value of `awk` and the difference between `temp[i]` and `temp[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is increased by 1 for the next iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute again, the length of `temp` must be greater than the updated value of `i`. 
Output State: **`awk` is updated based on the maximum value calculation, `i` is one more than the previous value, for the loop to execute another time the length of `temp` must be greater than the updated `i`**
