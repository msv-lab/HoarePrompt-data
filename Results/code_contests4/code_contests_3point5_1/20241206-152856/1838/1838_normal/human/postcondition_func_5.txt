The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit and stack size, then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function. The function is expected to return a tuple of three integers `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive integers. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated based on specific conditions. However, the actual calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions specified in the annotations is missing from the code. The functionality should include the calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions provided in the annotations.
