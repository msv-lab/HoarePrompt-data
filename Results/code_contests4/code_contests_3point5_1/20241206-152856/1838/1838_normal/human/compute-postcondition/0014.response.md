According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `args` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. To execute the loop again, there must be at least one more element in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more element in `args`**
