Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` function writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `at_start` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements in args.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements in args**
