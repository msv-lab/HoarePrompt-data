Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are popped from the `kwargs` dictionary with default values of ' ' and `sys.stdout` respectively if they exist, otherwise, they remain unchanged. Since there are no specific values mentioned for `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`, the output state is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **No change in the initial state**
