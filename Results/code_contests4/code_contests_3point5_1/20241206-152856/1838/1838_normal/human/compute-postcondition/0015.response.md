The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The variable `at_start` is not affected by this operation. Since the code snippet provided does not mention any changes to the loop or `args`, we can assume they remain the same. 

Output State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more element in `args`**
