Example Answer:
The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` function removes the 'end' key from the kwargs dictionary if it exists, otherwise it returns '\n'. The value returned is then written to the file. Since `end` key is not present in the dictionary and the default value '\n' is returned, a newline character will be written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False and a newline character is written to the file.
Output State: **`at_start` is False and a newline character is written to the file**
