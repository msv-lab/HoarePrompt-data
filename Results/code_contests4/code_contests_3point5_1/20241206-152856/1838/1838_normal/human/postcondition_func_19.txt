The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to a file separated by the specified separator. It then writes a newline character to the file and flushes the file if the 'flush' key is present in the `kwargs` dictionary. The functionality does not align entirely with the annotations as the actual code does not specify the input parameters `args` and `kwargs`.
