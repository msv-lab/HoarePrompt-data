You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yura is tasked to build a closed fence in shape of an arbitrary non-degenerate simple quadrilateral. He's already got three straight fence segments with known lengths a, b, and c. Now he needs to find out some possible integer length d of the fourth straight fence segment so that he can build the fence using these four segments. In other words, the fence should have a quadrilateral shape with side lengths equal to a, b, c, and d. Help Yura, find any possible length of the fourth side.

A non-degenerate simple quadrilateral is such a quadrilateral that no three of its corners lie on the same line, and it does not cross itself.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The next t lines describe the test cases.

Each line contains three integers a, b, and c — the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case print a single integer d — the length of the fourth fence segment that is suitable for building the fence. If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Example

Input


2
1 2 3
12 34 56


Output


4
42

Note

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 1, 2, 3, 4.

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 12, 34, 56, 42.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function func_1 does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value obtained from user input. The function solely focuses on obtaining and returning an integer from user input, with no additional logic or error handling present.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function `func_2` prompts the user to enter a value, and then returns the input value provided by the user. It does not specify any restrictions on the type or format of the input, and it directly returns whatever the user inputs.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It takes input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integer values. However, it does not handle any potential errors that may arise during input processing or conversion.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string input, splits it by space, converts each element to a string, and returns a map object. It does not handle any edge cases or errors related to the input.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of values calculated by calling the function `func_3()`. The function assumes that `func_3` returns a list of values, and it simply returns that list without any modifications. It does not perform any additional computations or checks.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit and stack size, then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function. The function is expected to return a tuple of three integers `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive integers. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated based on specific conditions. However, the actual calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions specified in the annotations is missing from the code. The functionality should include the calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions provided in the annotations.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function func_7 accepts a parameter 'item', which is expected to be a list or tuple. It then returns the value of the second element in the 'item'. The function does not handle cases where 'item' is not a list or tuple, or if 'item' does not have a second element.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns a sorted list in reverse order based on the custom key function 'getKey'. The function does not define the implementation of the custom key function 'getKey', so its behavior is dependent on the definition of 'getKey' outside the function.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function func_9 accepts three integers, n, m, and num, and returns a 2D list with n rows and m columns, where each element in the list is equal to num. The function creates the 2D list by using list comprehension.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `x` and returns the result of the expression `x and not x & x - 1`.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer n and returns its binary representation without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer n to a binary string and removes the '0b' prefix before returning the result.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function func_12 accepts a parameter `n` which is a string and converts each character in the string to an integer, returning a list of these integers.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `r`. It calculates the combination of `n` choose `r` using the factorial function and returns the result. The function correctly computes the combination without any missing functionality or edge cases.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. Therefore, the function provides the integer division result of `x` by `y`, potentially adjusted by 1 if `x` is not exactly divisible by `y.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It calculates the result of `x` raised to the power of the original value of `y` modulo `p`. The function utilizes a loop to perform the calculation based on the binary representation of `y`. The final result is returned.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, and iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the final value of `x`, which is 1.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns True or False based on various conditions. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False. If `n` is not divisible by 2, 3, or any number i such that i * i is less than or equal to `n`, the function returns True. The function covers these cases accurately according to the code, but the annotations do not align with the actual functionality in some cases.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function func_18 does not accept any parameters and sets the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It then returns the integer 18.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        (a, b, c) = func_3()
        func_20(c + 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function func_19 does not accept any parameters and iterates over the range of values returned by func_1(). Within each iteration, it assigns the values returned by func_3() to variables a, b, and c. After all iterations are completed, it calls func_20 with the value of c incremented by 1. The function overall seems to be focused on iterating through func_1() values and performing operations based on the results of func_3().
Function number 20 :
 Code:

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
