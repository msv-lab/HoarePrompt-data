You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yura is tasked to build a closed fence in shape of an arbitrary non-degenerate simple quadrilateral. He's already got three straight fence segments with known lengths a, b, and c. Now he needs to find out some possible integer length d of the fourth straight fence segment so that he can build the fence using these four segments. In other words, the fence should have a quadrilateral shape with side lengths equal to a, b, c, and d. Help Yura, find any possible length of the fourth side.

A non-degenerate simple quadrilateral is such a quadrilateral that no three of its corners lie on the same line, and it does not cross itself.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The next t lines describe the test cases.

Each line contains three integers a, b, and c — the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case print a single integer d — the length of the fourth fence segment that is suitable for building the fence. If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Example

Input


2
1 2 3
12 34 56


Output


4
42

Note

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 1, 2, 3, 4.

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 12, 34, 56, 42.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value obtained from user input. The function solely focuses on obtaining and returning an integer from user input, with no additional logic or error handling present.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input value entered by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user to enter a value, and then returns the input value provided by the user. It does not specify any restrictions on the type or format of the input, and it directly returns whatever the user inputs.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element of the input taken from the user to an integer after splitting the input by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It takes input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integer values. However, it does not handle any potential errors that may arise during input processing or conversion.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and c where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.**
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object where each element is converted to a string after splitting the input string by space.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string input, splits it by space, converts each element to a string, and returns a map object. It does not handle any edge cases or errors related to the input.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer.**
**a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9.**
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by calling the function `func_3()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of values calculated by calling the function `func_3()`. The function assumes that `func_3` returns a list of values, and it simply returns that list without any modifications. It does not perform any additional computations or checks.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer. a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.**
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit and stack size, then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function. The function is expected to return a tuple of three integers `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are positive integers. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated based on specific conditions. However, the actual calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions specified in the annotations is missing from the code. The functionality should include the calculation of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions provided in the annotations.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the value of the second element in the list or tuple 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts a parameter 'item', which is expected to be a list or tuple. It then returns the value of the second element in the 'item'. The function does not handle cases where 'item' is not a list or tuple, or if 'item' does not have a second element.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list 'l' in reverse order based on the custom key function 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns a sorted list in reverse order based on the custom key function 'getKey'. The function does not define the implementation of the custom key function 'getKey', so its behavior is dependent on the definition of 'getKey' outside the function.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list with 'n' rows and 'm' columns, where each element in the list is 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_9 accepts three integers, n, m, and num, and returns a 2D list with n rows and m columns, where each element in the list is equal to num. The function creates the 2D list by using list comprehension.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns x and not x & x - 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `x` and returns the result of the expression `x and not x & x - 1`.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of the integer variable 'n', removing the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer n and returns its binary representation without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer n to a binary string and removes the '0b' prefix before returning the result.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from each character in the string 'n'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_12 accepts a parameter `n` which is a string and converts each character in the string to an integer, returning a list of these integers.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
    #The program returns the result of calculating the combination of n choose r, where n, r, and the factorial function are involved in the calculation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `r`. It calculates the combination of `n` choose `r` using the factorial function and returns the result. The function correctly computes the combination without any missing functionality or edge cases.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns the result of integer division of x by y, where x is an integer divisible by y
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the result of integer division of x by y plus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. Therefore, the function provides the integer division result of `x` by `y`, potentially adjusted by 1 if `x` is not exactly divisible by `y.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res` is the result of `x` raised to the power of the original value of `y` modulo `p`, `y` is 0, `x` is updated based on the operations in the loop
    return res
    #The program returns the result of 'x' raised to the power of the original value of 'y' modulo 'p'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It calculates the result of `x` raised to the power of the original value of `y` modulo `p`. The function utilizes a loop to perform the calculation based on the binary representation of `y`. The final result is returned.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 1, `y` is 2
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x, which is 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, and iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the final value of `x`, which is 1.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer. n is larger than 1.
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer larger than 1. n is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer larger than 1, n is greater than 3. n is not divisible by 2 or 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is an integer larger than 1, not divisible by 2 or 3. The loop terminates when i is such that i * i is greater than n.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns True or False based on various conditions. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False. If `n` is not divisible by 2, 3, or any number i such that i * i is less than or equal to `n`, the function returns True. The function covers these cases accurately according to the code, but the annotations do not align with the actual functionality in some cases.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_18 does not accept any parameters and sets the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to a file named 'output.txt'. It then returns the integer 18.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        a, b, c = func_3()
        
        func_20(c + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the return values of `func_3()` after all the iterations of the loop have finished.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_19 does not accept any parameters and iterates over the range of values returned by func_1(). Within each iteration, it assigns the values returned by func_3() to variables a, b, and c. After all iterations are completed, it calls func_20 with the value of c incremented by 1. The function overall seems to be focused on iterating through func_1() values and performing operations based on the results of func_3().

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_20():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is False and a newline character is written to the file. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs` dictionary, it is removed. No other changes occur in the program state after the execution of the if-else block.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to a file separated by the specified separator. It then writes a newline character to the file and flushes the file if the 'flush' key is present in the `kwargs` dictionary. The functionality does not align entirely with the annotations as the actual code does not specify the input parameters `args` and `kwargs`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
