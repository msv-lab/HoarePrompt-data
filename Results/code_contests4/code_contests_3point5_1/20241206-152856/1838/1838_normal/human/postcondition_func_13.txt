The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. Therefore, the function provides the integer division result of `x` by `y`, potentially adjusted by 1 if `x` is not exactly divisible by `y.
