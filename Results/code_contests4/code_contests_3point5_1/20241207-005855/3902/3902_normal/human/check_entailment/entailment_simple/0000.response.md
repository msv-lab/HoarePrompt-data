Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic described in the problem description. The program should be counting the number of excellent numbers of length exactly n that can be formed using only the digits a and b. However, the program does not include any logic to calculate this.

The program only initializes a list of integers from a pre-defined string, but this list is not used to calculate the required result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
