Example Answer:
The string `s` is split using the `split()` method and then each element is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. As `a` is assigned the list of integers, the values of `a` are influenced by the numbers in the string `s`. Since the initial state of `a` and `b` is not given, we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `s`, `b` remains unchanged, `n` and `s` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `s`, `b` remains unchanged, `n` and `s` remain unchanged**
