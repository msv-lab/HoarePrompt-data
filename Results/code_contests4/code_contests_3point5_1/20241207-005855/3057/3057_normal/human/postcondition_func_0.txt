The function `func` reads input values for `steps` and `index`, converts them to integers, and calculates a value based on the input constraints. If the index is odd, it prints 1. If the index is even, it iterates until the midpoint between `left` and `right` is equal to the index, then prints the number of steps taken in the iteration. The function does not accept any parameters, and the return value is based on the input constraints provided for `n` and `k`.
