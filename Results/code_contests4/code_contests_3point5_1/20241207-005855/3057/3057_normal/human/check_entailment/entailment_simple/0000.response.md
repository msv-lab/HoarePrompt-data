Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm to find the value of the element at the k-th position in the generated sequence. 

1. The program reads input values for `steps` and `index` using `raw_input()`, which is not a valid function in Python. It should use `input()` instead.
2. The program then checks if the index is odd and prints 1 if true. This logic is incorrect as it does not follow the algorithm described in the problem.
3. The while loop that follows is trying to update `steps` based on the index value, but the logic is incorrect. The loop should be updating the sequence generation process according to the algorithm provided in the problem description.
4. The print statement inside the loop prints `steps`, which is incorrect. The program should output the element at the k-th position in the sequence, not the number of steps taken.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
