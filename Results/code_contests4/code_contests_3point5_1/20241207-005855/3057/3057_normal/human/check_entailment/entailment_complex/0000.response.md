Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem description. The program does not generate the sequence of integers as described in the problem. It calculates a value based on the input values `n` and `k`, but it does not generate the sequence and find the value at the k-th position in the obtained sequence. 

The program simply calculates the value `steps` based on the input values and prints it if the index is even. If the index is odd, it simply prints 1. This is not the correct behavior as per the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
