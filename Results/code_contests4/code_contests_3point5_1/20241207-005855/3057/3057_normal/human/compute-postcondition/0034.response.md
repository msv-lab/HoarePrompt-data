The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return a value based on the constraints provided for the parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints state that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1. The function is expected to return a value based on these constraints.
