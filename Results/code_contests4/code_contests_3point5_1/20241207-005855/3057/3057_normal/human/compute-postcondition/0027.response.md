Output State: `n`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 1, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is updated to a new value, `right` is updated to a new value for the loop to execute one more time. `right` is assigned the value of `(right + left) / 2 - 1`, which means `right` is updated based on the current values of `right` and `left`.
