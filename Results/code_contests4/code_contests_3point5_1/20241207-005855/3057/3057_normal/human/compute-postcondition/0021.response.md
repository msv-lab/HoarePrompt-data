Example Answer: 
`right` is updated to a new value which is calculated as `(right + left) / 2 - 1`. Since `left` is 1, the new value of `right` will be `(right + 1) / 2 - 1`. The condition `index is greater than the new midpoint of left and updated right` implies that `index > (1 + right) / 2 - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 2, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, and `right` is updated to a new value where `index > (1 + right) / 2 - 1`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 2, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, and `right` is updated to a new value where `index > (1 + right) / 2 - 1`**
