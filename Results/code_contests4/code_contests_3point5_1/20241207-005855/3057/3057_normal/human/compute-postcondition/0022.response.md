Example Answer:
`left` and `right` are updated to a new value where both are calculated as the midpoint of the previous values of `left` and `right` plus 1. Since `left` is initially 1, and `right` is updated to a new value, the new midpoint is greater than the index. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 2, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is updated to a new value, `right` is updated to a new value where index is greater than the new midpoint of left and updated right.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 2, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is updated to a new value, `right` is updated to a new value where index is greater than the new midpoint of left and updated right**
