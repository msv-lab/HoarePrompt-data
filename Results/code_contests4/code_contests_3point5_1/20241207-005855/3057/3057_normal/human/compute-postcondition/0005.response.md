Example Answer:
`left` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1**
