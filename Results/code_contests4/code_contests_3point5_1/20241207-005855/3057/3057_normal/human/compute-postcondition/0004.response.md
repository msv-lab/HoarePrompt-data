Example Answer:
`index` is assigned the value of `int(index)`, where `int` converts the input to an integer. The variables `n`, `k`, `steps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input**
