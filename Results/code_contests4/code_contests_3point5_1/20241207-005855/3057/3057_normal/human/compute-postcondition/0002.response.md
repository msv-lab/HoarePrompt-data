Example Answer:
`steps` is assigned the first value after splitting the input by space, and `index` is assigned the second value after splitting the input by space. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected, so the output state is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; steps is the first value of the input, index is the second value of the input.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; steps is the first value of the input, index is the second value of the input**
