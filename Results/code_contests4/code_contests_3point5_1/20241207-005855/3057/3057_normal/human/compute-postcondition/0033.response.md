Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is either 1 or a newly updated value, `right` is either calculated as `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)` or a newly updated value. After the execution of the if else block, the program variables will retain their initial conditions. If the index is odd, the variables stay the same, and index remains an odd number. If the index is even, `left` and `right` are updated such that (right + left) / 2 = index, and the loop completes all iterations. The final value of `steps` is printed.***
