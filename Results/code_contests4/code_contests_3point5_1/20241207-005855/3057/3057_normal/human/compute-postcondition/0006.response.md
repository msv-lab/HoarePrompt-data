Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value of `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`, where `math.pow(2, steps)` calculates 2 raised to the power of `steps`. The value of `steps` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `right`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, `right` is calculated as `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, `right` is calculated as `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`**
