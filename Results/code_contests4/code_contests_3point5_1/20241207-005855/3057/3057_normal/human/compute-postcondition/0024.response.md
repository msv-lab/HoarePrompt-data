Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 2, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is updated to a new value, and `right` is updated to a new value. If index < (right + left) / 2, `right` is set to a new value where `index > (1 + right) / 2 - 1`. Otherwise, if index is greater than the new midpoint of left and updated right, then the program will have the mentioned state after the execution of the if else block.***
