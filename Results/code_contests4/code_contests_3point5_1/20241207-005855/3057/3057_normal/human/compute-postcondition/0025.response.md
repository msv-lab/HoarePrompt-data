According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `(right + left) / 2 != index` is true. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the midpoint of `left` and `right` should not be equal to `index`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
1. `left` needs to be updated to a new value.
2. `right` needs to be updated to a new value.

State: **`n`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 2, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is updated to a new value, `right` is updated to a new value for the loop to execute one more time**
