Example Answer:
The variable `steps` is assigned the integer value of the input `steps`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `index` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input**
