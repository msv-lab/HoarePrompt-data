According to the code, the loop will execute again if the midpoint of `left` and `right` is not equal to `index`. At the end of the previous iteration, the initial states are as follows: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 1, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, `right` is calculated as `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`. The index is not an odd number.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- If the midpoint of `left` and `right` is not equal to `index`, then `right` should be updated to a new value.
- The index should be greater than the new midpoint of `left` and updated `right`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 1, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, `right` is updated to a new value, index is greater than the new midpoint of left and updated right**
