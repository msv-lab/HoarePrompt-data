Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `steps`. Since there are no other operations or changes to the variables mentioned, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is updated to a new value, `right` is updated to a new value such that (right + left) / 2 = index. The loop has terminated after all iterations. The value of `steps` is printed.**
