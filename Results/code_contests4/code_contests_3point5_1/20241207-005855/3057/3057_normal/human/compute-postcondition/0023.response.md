Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 2, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is updated to a new value, and `right` is updated to a new value. If index is greater than the new midpoint of left and updated right, then the program will have the mentioned state after the execution of the if else block.***
