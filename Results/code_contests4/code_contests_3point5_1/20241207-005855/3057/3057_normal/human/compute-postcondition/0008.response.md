Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, `right` is calculated as `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`. After entering the if condition where index % 2 == 1, the program variables are as follows: `n` and `k` remain integers satisfying the given conditions, `steps` remains an integer, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` remains 1, and `right` is still calculated as `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`. Additionally, index is an odd number.**
