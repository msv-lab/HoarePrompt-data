Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1; `steps` is an integer - 1, `index` is the second value of the input, `left` is 1, `right` is calculated as `int(math.pow(2, steps) - 1)`. The index is not an odd number, for the loop to execute the first time, the calculated midpoint of left and right should not be equal to index. If the index is less than (right + left) / 2, `right` is updated to a new value. If the index is greater than or equal to (right + left) / 2, the index is greater than (right + left) / 2 after the if condition.***
