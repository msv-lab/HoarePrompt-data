Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the described problem. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the value at the k-th position in the obtained sequence. The program only prints "1" if the index is odd, which is not the correct approach.

The correct solution involves recursively building the sequence according to the described algorithm and then directly accessing the k-th element in the sequence. The given program does not implement this logic and hence is incorrect.
