Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. It does not generate the sequence as described in the problem statement. The output of the program is not the value of the element at the k-th position in the obtained sequence. 

The program should append the sequence to itself and insert the minimum positive integer not used before in the middle, but the program does not follow this logic. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
