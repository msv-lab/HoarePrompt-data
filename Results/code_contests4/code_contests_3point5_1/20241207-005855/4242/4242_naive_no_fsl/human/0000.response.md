Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes four integer numbers and three signs as input, then calculates the minimal result that can be obtained by performing the given sequence of operations. The program uses permutations to try all possible orders of the numbers and operations, then evaluates the expressions to find the minimal result. The logic seems to correctly implement the problem description and there are no obvious missing edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
