Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads input consisting of four integers a, b, c, d where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000 and a sequence of three signs either '+' or '*'. It then evaluates different expressions formed by performing the sequence of operations on the input integers a, b, c, and d. The function calculates the minimum value obtained from these evaluations and prints it as the final result. The code seems to cover all possible cases and correctly implements the logic based on the problem description. The use of itertools.permutations to try all possible orders of the numbers and operations ensures that all combinations are considered to find the minimum result. The eval function is used to evaluate the expressions and the minimum value is updated accordingly. Overall, the code appears to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
