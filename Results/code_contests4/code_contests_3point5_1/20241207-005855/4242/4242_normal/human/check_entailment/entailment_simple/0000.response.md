Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads four integers as input and the sequence of operations. It then iterates through all permutations of the four integers and calculates the result based on the given sequence of operations. The program then finds the minimum result obtained from all the evaluations and prints it.

The program follows the problem description by taking four integers and a sequence of operations as input, performing the operations as described, and outputting the minimum result that can be obtained.
