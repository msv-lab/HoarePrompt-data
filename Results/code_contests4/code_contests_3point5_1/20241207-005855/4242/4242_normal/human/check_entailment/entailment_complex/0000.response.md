Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads four integers a, b, c, d and a sequence of three signs '+' or '*' as input. It then evaluates different expressions formed by performing the sequence of operations on the input integers a, b, c, and d. The program calculates the minimum value obtained from these evaluations and prints it as the final result. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which requires finding the smallest number that can be obtained from the original numbers by the given sequence of operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
