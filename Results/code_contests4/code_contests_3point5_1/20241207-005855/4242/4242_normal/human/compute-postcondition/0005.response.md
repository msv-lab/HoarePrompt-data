Example Answer:
The code snippet compares the value of `res` with the result of the expression constructed using the values of `c` and `z`. After the comparison, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of the expression. The values of `a` and `z` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`res` is updated to a new value after the comparison, `a` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged**
