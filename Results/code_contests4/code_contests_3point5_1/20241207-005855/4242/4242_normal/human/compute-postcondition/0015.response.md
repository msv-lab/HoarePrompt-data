Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input consisting of four integers a, b, c, d where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000 and a sequence of three signs either '+' or '*'. It then evaluates different expressions formed by performing the sequence of operations on the input integers a, b, c, and d. The function calculates the minimum value obtained from these evaluations and prints it as the final result.**
