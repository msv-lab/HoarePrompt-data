According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `itertools.permutations(a)`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` is a very large number does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is a list of strings with at least one string element, and `z` must be populated by splitting the input. 
State: **`res` is a very large number, `a` is a list of strings with at least one string element, `z` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, for the loop to execute `itertools.permutations(a)` must have at least one permutation**
