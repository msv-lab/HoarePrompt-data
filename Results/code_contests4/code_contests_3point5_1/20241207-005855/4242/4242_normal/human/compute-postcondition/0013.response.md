Example Answer: 
The code prints the value stored in the variable `res`. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `res`, the output state will only mention that `a` and `z` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`res` is printed, `a` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged**
