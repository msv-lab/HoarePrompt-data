Example Answer:
'res' is updated to a new value after comparison based on the evaluation of the expression provided. 'a' remains unchanged, 'z' remains unchanged, and the loop may continue for more permutations of 'a'. The new value of 'res' is determined by evaluating the expression using the values of 'c' and 'z'. 
Output State: **'res' is updated to a new value after comparison, 'a' remains unchanged, 'z' remains unchanged, loop may continue for more permutations of 'a'**
