Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the result of `raw_input().split()`. Since raw_input() is not a valid function in Python 3, assuming it is meant to be `input()`, the input is split by spaces into a list stored in `a`. The value of `res` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: res is a very large number, `a` is a list of strings.
Output State: **res is a very large number, `a` is a list of strings**
