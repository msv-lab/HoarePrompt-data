Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes four integers as input and three signs representing the operations. It then calculates all possible permutations of the input integers and evaluates the expressions according to the given sequence of operations. The program finds the minimum result that can be obtained from the original numbers.

The program uses the itertools library to generate permutations of the input numbers, and then evaluates the expressions using the eval function. It considers all possible combinations of the input numbers and operations, ensuring that it finds the smallest possible result. 

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the minimal result that can be obtained from the original numbers based on the given operations, it can be considered correct.
