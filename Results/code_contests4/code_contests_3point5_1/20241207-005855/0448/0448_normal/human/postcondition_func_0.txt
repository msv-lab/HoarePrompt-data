The function `func_1` reads input data for integers `n`, `m`, lists `h` and `p`, and performs a complex computational process involving binary search and nested loops to determine certain conditions based on the input values. The function outputs the value of `ss` after the loop execution. However, the specific purpose or outcome of this computational process is not explicitly defined in the code or annotations.
