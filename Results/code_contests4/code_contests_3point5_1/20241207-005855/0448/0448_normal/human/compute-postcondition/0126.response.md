Output State: **`pidx` is 0, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
