According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx` and `pidx`. If `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is incremented by 1, and `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `hidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of list `h`, and `pidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of list `p`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`works` is a boolean, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer based on the calculation mentioned above, `alsotoright` is the result of the operation max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is the result of max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`**
