According to the code, the loop can execute if both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both `hidx` and `pidx` need to be less than the length of their respective arrays. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, both `hidx` and `pidx` need to be increased by 1.
State: **`hidx` and `pidx` are increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
