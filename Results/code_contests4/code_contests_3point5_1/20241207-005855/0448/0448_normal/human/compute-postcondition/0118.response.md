The loop increments the value of `pidx` as long as `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and the element at index `pidx` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. Once the loop finishes executing, `pidx` will have been incremented by the number of elements in list `p` that satisfy the given condition.
Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by the number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p)`**
