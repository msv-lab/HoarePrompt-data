Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`. The value of `getbacktime` is recalculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. Therefore, the value of `alsotoright` depends on the recalculated value of `getbacktime`. 
Output State: **`getbacktime` is recalculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is assigned based on the recalculated value of `getbacktime`.**
