According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. 
If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. 
Right before the loop, `furthestright` is updated based on the recalculated `remtime`. So for the loop to execute the first time, `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` and there must be an element in `p` that is less than or equal to the updated `furthestright`.
State: **`furthestright` is updated based on the recalculated `remtime`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and there exists an element `p[pidx]` that is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
