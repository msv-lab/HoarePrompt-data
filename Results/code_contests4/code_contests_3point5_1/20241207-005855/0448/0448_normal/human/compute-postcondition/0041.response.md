Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The other variables `furthestright`, `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to `furthestright`; `pidx` is incremented by 1.
