Example Answer:
The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `furthestright` remains unchanged, `hidx` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`pidx` is equal to the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `furthestright` remains unchanged, `hidx` is increased by 1**
