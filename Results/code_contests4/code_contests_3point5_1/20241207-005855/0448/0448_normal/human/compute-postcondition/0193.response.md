Example Answer:
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, where `p` is a list and `pidx` is the index of the element to be accessed. The values of `hidx` and `pidx` are increased by 1 for the loop to execute again. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` and `pidx` are increased by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
Output State: **`hidx` and `pidx` are increased by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
