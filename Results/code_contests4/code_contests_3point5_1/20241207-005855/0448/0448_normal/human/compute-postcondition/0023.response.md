At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are that `pidx` should be less than the length of list `p` and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`. Additionally, there should be at least one more element in the list `p` after the current index being accessed.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `pidx` should be incremented by 1 to access the next index in list `p`.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing should be adjusted to check if `pidx + 1` is less than the length of list `p`.
- The value at index `pidx + 1` in list `p` should be less than or equal to the updated `furthestright`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is 0, `ll` is a large number, `avg` is half of the large number, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again there should be at least one more element in list `p` after the current index being accessed, and the value at index `pidx + 1` in list `p` is less than or equal to the updated `furthestright`**.
