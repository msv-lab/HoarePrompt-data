According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop will execute again if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is increased by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be increased by 1 again and `furthestright` remains unchanged.
State: **`pidx` is increased by 2, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged**
