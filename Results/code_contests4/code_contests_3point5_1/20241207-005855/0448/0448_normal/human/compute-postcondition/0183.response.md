Example Answer:
`getbacktime` is recalculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is then assigned based on the recalculated value of `getbacktime`. `remtime` is also recalculated based on the formula `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`. Finally, `furthestright` is calculated by adding `curpos` to the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`. The values of all variables are dependent on the initial values of `curpos`, `leftget`, `avg`, and `leftime`. 
Output State: **dependent on the initial values of the variables**
