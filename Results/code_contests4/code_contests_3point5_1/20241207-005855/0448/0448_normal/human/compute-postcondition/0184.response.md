According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, the states are dependent on the initial values of the variables. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `pidx` needs to be less than the length of list `p`.
2. The element at index `pidx` in list `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.
No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **dependent on the initial values of the variables, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` should be less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
