Output State: **`works` is false, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, and `getbacktime` is calculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`.**
