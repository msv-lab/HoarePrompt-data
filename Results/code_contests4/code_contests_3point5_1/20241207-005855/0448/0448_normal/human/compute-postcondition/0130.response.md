Output State: **`pidx` is 0, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `works` is False if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `remtime` is the maximum of 0 and the result of (avg - leftime) divided by 2, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
