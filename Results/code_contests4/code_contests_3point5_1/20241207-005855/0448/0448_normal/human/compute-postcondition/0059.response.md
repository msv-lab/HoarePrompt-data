According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `pidx` should be incremented to move to the next index.
2. `furthestright` needs to be recalculated based on the updated values.

State: **`pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime` is calculated based on the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is updated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`, `remtime` is updated based on the calculation mentioned, `furthestright` is recalculated based on the mentioned formula**
