Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to `furthestright`; `pidx` is incremented by 1.
