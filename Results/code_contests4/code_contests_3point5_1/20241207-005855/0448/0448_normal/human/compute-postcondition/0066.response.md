Example Answer:
The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so after execution, `hidx` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is increased by the total number of elements in `p` that satisfy the condition, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pidx` is increased by the total number of elements in `p` that satisfy the condition, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged**
