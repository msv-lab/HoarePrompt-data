Example Answer:
`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. The values of `curpos` and `alsotoright` remain the same, but `remtime` is recalculated. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `furthestright` is determined by the recalculated `remtime`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`furthestright` is updated based on the recalculated `remtime`**
