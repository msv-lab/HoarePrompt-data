Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`. The variables `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, and `getbacktime` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx`, `pidx` are integers increased by 1. `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, if `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False. `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`.
Output State: **`hidx`, `pidx` are integers increased by 1. `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, if `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False. `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`**
