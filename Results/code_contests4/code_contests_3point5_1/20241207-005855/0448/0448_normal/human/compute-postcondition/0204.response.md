Example Answer:
The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: Dependent on the initial values of `hidx`, `pidx`, `p`, `h`, `avg`, `works`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `furthestright`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is incremented by 1.
