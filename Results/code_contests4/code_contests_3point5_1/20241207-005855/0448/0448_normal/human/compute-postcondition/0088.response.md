Example Answer:
The value of `getbacktime` is calculated as the maximum between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. Since the initial state mentions that if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is False, and the values of `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, and `curpos` are defined, we can calculate `getbacktime` accordingly.
Output State: **`works` is a boolean, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer based on the calculation mentioned above**
