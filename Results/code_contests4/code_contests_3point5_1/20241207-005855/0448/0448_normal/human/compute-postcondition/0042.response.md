According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. At the end of the previous iteration, `furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`. To ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to `furthestright`; `pidx` is incremented by 1**
