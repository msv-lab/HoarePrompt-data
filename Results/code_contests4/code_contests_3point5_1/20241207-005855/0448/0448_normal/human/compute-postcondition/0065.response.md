The loop increments the value of `pidx` by the number of elements in the list `p` that meet the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. This means that `pidx` will be incremented by the total number of elements that satisfy the condition. All other variables will remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Output State: **`pidx` is increased by the total number of elements in `p` that satisfy the condition, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged.**
