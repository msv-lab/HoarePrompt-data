Example Answer: 
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The values of `works`, `hidx`, and `pidx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `works` is True, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
Output State: **`works` is True, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
