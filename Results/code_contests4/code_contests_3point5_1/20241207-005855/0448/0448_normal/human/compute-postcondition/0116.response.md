According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in array `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is further increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be further increased by 1, and no other states need adjustment.
State: **variable `pidx` is further increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is further increased by 1**
