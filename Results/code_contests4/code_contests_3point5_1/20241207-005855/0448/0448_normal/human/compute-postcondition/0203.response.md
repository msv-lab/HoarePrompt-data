According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. 

Right before the loop, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p`.
- The value at index `pidx` in `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **Dependent on the initial values of `hidx`, `pidx`, `p`, `h`, `avg`, `works`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `furthestright`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
