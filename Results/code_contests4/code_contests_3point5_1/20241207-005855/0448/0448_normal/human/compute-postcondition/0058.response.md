Example Answer: 
`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime` is calculated based on the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is updated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`, `remtime` is updated based on the calculation mentioned, `furthestright` is calculated based on the mentioned formula.
