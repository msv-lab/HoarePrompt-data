Output State: **`works` is a boolean, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, `pidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer based on the calculation mentioned above, `alsotoright` is the result of the operation max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is the result of max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright**
