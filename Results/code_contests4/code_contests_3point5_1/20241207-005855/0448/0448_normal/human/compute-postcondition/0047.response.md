Example Answer:
The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `hidx` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` after all iterations of the loop have executed; `pidx` is equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `hidx` is incremented by 1.
