Example Answer:
If `works` is true, then `avg` is assigned the value of `(ss + ll) // 2`. If `works` is false, then `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula; If `works` is false, `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`.
Output State: **If `works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula; If `works` is false, `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1**.
