Example Answer:
The value of `lefttime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. If `curpos` is greater than `leftget`, `lefttime` will be `curpos - leftget`, otherwise, it will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` remain the same, `lefttime` is calculated based on the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is updated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`**
