According to the code, the loop can execute if both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. Right before the loop, `works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0. 

For the loop to execute the first time, both `hidx` and `pidx` need to be less than the respective lengths of `h` and `p`. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- `hidx` needs to be less than the length of `h`
- `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p`

No other states need adjustment.
State: **`works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of `p`**
