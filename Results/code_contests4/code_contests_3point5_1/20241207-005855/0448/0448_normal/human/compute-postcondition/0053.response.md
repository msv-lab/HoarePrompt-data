Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`. `pidx` is either equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`. `hidx` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, where `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, and `works` is False.***
