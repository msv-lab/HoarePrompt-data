Example Answer:
The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The value of `furthestright` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute again, `pidx` should be less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is further incremented, `furthestright` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`pidx` is further incremented, `furthestright` remains unchanged**
