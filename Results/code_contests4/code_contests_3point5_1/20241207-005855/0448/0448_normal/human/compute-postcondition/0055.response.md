Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`. The values of `avg` and `getbacktime` are not provided, so the exact value of `alsotoright` cannot be determined. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` remain the same, and `alsotoright` is updated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`.
Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` remain the same, and `alsotoright` is updated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`**
