According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ss` is less than `ll`. Right before the loop, `ss` is 0 and `ll` is a large number. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `ss` needs to be less than `ll`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ll` is a large number**
