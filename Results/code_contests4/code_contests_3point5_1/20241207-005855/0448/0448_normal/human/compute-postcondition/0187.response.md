Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again as long as `pidx` is still less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is still less than or equal to `furthestright`. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`pidx` is further incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is still less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is still less than or equal to `furthestright`**
