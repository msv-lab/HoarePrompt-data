Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `pidx` is incremented by 1, loop condition is checked with updated `pidx`.
Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by 1, loop condition is checked with updated `pidx`**
