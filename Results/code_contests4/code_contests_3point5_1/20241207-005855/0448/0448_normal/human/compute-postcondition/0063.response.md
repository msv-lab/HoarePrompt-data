According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `pidx` is increased by 3. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be adjusted to `pidx increased by 3 more`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`pidx` is increased by 6, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged**
