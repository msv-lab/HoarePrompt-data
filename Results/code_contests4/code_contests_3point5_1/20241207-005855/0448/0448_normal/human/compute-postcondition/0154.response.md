Example Answer: 
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The values of `p` and `pidx` are not provided, so the specific value of `leftget` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.
Output State: **`works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of `p`**
