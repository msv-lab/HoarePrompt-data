Example Answer:
The value of `pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, so after execution, the new value of `pidx` is one more than the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright` updated based on `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to the new value of `furthestright`; `pidx` is one more than the previous value.
Output State: **`furthestright` updated based on `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to the new value of `furthestright`; `pidx` is one more than the previous value**
