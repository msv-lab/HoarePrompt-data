Example Answer:
The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous values of other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `pidx` is incremented by the number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p); `hidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by the number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p); `hidx` is incremented by 1**
