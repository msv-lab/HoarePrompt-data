According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `len(p)`, `p[pidx]`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is further incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` should be less than `len(p)` after the increment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pidx` is further incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is still less than `len(p)` and `p[pidx]` is still less than or equal to `furthestright`**
