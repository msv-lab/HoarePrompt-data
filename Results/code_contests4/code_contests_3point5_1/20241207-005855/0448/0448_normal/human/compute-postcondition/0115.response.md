Example Answer:
The value of `pidx` is increased by 1. Since the initial state of `pidx` is not specified, we can infer that `pidx` starts at an unknown value and is then increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `pidx` is further increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `pidx` is further increased by 1**
