According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ss` and `ll`. If `ss` is less than `ll`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `works` is a boolean. If `works` is true, the values of `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are updated as described in the program fragment. If `works` is false, `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `ss` needs to be less than `ll`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `works` is true, the values of `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` are updated as described. If `works` is false, `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1 and for the loop to execute again `ss` must be less than `ll`**
