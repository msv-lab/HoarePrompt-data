According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and the element at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented, and `furthestright` remains unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, `pidx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of list `p`, and the element at index `pidx` in list `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`.
State: **`pidx` is incremented, `furthestright` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
