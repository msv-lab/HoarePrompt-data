Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is 0, `ll` is a large number, `avg` is half of the large number, `works` is True, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is such that it is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or equal to the length of `p`, for the loop to execute one more time `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` in list `p`, `curpos` is the value at index `hidx` in list `c`. If `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is set to False.***
