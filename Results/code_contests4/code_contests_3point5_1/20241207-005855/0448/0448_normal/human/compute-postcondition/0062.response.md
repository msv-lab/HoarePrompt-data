Example Answer:
The value of `pidx` is increased by 1, and the initial state mentions that `pidx` is increased by 2. Therefore, after execution, `pidx` will be increased by a total of 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pidx` is increased by 3, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged**
