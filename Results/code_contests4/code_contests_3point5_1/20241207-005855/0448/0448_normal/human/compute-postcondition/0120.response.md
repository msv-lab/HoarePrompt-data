According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx`, `pidx`, `h`, and `p`. If `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by the number of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to `furthestright` and `pidx` is greater than or equal to the length of list `p`, and `hidx` is incremented by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` should be reset to 0, `hidx` should be incremented by 1, and the condition of `pidx` being greater than or equal to the length of list `p` should be changed to `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`.
State: **`pidx` is 0, `hidx` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p)**
