According to the code, the loop can execute if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. At the end of the last iteration, these conditions need to be met for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **Dependent on the initial values of `hidx`, `pidx`, `p`, `h`, `avg`, `works`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `furthestright`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is incremented by 1**
