Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference of `curpos` and `leftget`. The value of `curpos` and `leftget` are known, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables retain their previous values except `alsotoright` which is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference of `avg` and `getbacktime`.
Output State: **All variables retain their previous values except `alsotoright` which is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference of `avg` and `getbacktime`.**
