Example Answer: 
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is incremented by 1, the loop condition still holds true.
Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by 1, the loop condition still holds true**
