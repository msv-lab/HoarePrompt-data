Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, the program variables are in the following state: `works` is False, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, `getbacktime` is calculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated based on the formula `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.***
