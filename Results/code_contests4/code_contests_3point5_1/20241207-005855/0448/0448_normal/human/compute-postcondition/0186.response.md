According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be incremented further, and the loop condition should still hold true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pidx` is further incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is still less than len(p) and p[pidx] is still less than or equal to furthestright**
