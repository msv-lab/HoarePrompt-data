Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`. `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`.
Output State: **`furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`**
