Example Answer: 
`leftime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. The previous values of `curpos` and `leftget` are known, so we can calculate `leftime`. The output state is: `hidx`, `pidx` are integers increased by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, if `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.
Output State: **`hidx`, `pidx` are integers increased by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, if `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`**.
