According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. Right before the loop, `pidx` is 0, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `furthestright` is calculated based on certain conditions. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `pidx` needs to be incremented to a value greater than 0.
2. The list `p` needs to have at least one more element after the current index being accessed (`pidx`).
3. The value at index `pidx` in list `p` needs to be less than or equal to the updated `furthestright`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is 0, `ll` is a large number, `avg` is half of the large number, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again the list `p` has at least one more element after the current index being accessed, and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to the updated `furthestright`**
