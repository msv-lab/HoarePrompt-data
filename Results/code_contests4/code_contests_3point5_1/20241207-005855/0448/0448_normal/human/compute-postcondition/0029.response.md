According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if both `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` has been incremented by 1, and `pidx` is such that it is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or equal to the length of `p`, which means `pidx` is at a specific position in the list `p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state as follows:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is 0, `ll` is a large number, `avg` is half of the large number, `works` is True, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is such that it is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or equal to the length of `p`, for the loop to execute one more time `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`**
