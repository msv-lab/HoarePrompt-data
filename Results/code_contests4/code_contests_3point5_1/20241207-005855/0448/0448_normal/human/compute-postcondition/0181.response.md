Example Answer: 
`leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, where the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is taken. The value of `leftget` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `leftime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `getbacktime` is recalculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is assigned based on the recalculated value of `getbacktime`.
Output State: **`getbacktime` is recalculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is assigned based on the recalculated value of `getbacktime`**
