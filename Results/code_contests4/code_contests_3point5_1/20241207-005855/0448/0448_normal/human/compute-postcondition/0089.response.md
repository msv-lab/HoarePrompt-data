Example Answer: 
`alsotoright` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`. The variables `avg` and `getbacktime` are not provided in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `works` is a boolean, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer based on the calculation mentioned above, and `alsotoright` is the result of the operation max(0, avg - getbacktime).
Output State: **`works` is a boolean, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer based on the calculation mentioned above, `alsotoright` is the result of the operation max(0, avg - getbacktime)**
