Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is 0, `ll` is a large number, `avg` is half of the large number, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, `leftget` is the value of `p` at index `pidx`, `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and half of the large number minus `getbacktime`, `remtime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the integer division of the difference between `avg` and `leftime` divided by 2.**
