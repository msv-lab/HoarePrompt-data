According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is further incremented, and `furthestright` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be less than the updated length of list `p` after the previous iteration, and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` should still be less than or equal to `furthestright`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pidx` is further incremented, `furthestright` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
