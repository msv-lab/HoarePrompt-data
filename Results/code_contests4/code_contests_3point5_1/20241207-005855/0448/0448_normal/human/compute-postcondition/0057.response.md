Example Answer:
`remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `lefttime`. If `avg` is greater than `lefttime`, then `remtime` will be calculated as (avg - lefttime) // 2, otherwise it will be 0. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime` is calculated based on the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is updated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`, `remtime` is updated based on the calculation mentioned.
Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime` is calculated based on the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is updated based on `avg` and `getbacktime`, `remtime` is updated based on the calculation mentioned**
