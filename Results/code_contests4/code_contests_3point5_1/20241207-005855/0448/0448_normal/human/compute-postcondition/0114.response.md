According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in the list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be further increased by 1, and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `pidx` is further increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
