Example Answer:
The list `p` is created by mapping the input string into a list of integers. Since the input is split by spaces, each integer in the input will be a separate element in the list `p`. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5. `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input**
