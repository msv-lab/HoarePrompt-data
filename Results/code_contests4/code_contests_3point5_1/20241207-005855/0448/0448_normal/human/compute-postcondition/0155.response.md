Example Answer:
`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, where `h` is a list and `hidx` is an index. The value of `hidx` must be less than the length of `h` for the assignment to be valid. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
Output State: **`works` is true, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`**
