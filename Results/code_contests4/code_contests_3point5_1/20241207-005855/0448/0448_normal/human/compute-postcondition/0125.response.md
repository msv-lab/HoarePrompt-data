Postcondition: ***`pidx` is 0, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
