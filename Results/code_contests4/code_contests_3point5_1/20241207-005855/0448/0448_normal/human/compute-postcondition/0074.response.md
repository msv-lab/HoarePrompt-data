Example Answer:
`ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`, where `avg` is half of a large number. Therefore, `ss` is equal to half of the large number + 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is equal to half of a large number + 1, `ll` is a large number, `avg` is half of the large number, `works` is False, `hidx` is equal to the length of `h` or `h[hidx]` is greater than the last element of `p`, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` or `p[pidx]` is greater than the last element of `h`, `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p` and `works` is False**
