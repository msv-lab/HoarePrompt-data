Example Answer:
`pidx` is further incremented by 1. The value of `furthestright` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute again, `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is further incremented, `furthestright` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright.
Output State: **`pidx` is further incremented, `furthestright` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
