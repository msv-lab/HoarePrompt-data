Example Answer:
`leftget` is reassigned the value of `p[pidx]`. The previous state of the affected variables remains the same. 
Output State: **`works` is a boolean, `hidx` is incremented by 1, `pidx` is equal to the length of list `p`, `leftget` is assigned the new value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer based on the calculation mentioned above, `alsotoright` is the result of the operation max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is the result of max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is the result of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`**
