Output State: **`furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime` after all iterations of the loop have executed; `pidx` is either equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `hidx` needs to be less than the length of `h` and `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
