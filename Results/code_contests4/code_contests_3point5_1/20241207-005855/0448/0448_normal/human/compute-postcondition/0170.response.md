Output State: **`works` is false, `avg` is updated based on the formula, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is updated by 3, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, `getbacktime` is calculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, `leftime` is assigned the value of `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is calculated based on the formula `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` and for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright**
