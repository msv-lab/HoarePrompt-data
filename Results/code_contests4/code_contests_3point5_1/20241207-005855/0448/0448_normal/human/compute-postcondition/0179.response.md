Example Answer:
`getbacktime` is recalculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. The previous values of `curpos` and `leftget` are known, so the new value of `getbacktime` is determined by this calculation.
Output State: **`getbacktime` is recalculated based on the formula `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`**
