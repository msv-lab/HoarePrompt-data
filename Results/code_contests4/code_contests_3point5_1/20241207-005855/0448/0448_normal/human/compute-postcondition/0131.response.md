According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. Right before the loop, `pidx` is 0, `pidx` is less than len(p), and `p[pidx]` should be less than or equal to `furthestright` for the loop to execute. So, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `pidx` needs to be incremented to move to the next element in the list `p`.
2. `furthestright` needs to be updated based on the new values of `curpos`, `avg`, and other related variables.
State: **`pidx` needs to be incremented, `furthestright` needs to be updated**.
