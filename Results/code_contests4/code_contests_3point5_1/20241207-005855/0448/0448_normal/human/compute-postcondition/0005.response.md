Example Answer:
The variable `avg` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `ss` and `ll` by 2. The initial values of `ss` and `ll` are 0 and a large number respectively. Therefore, `avg` will be half of the large number. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `h` is a list of integers, `p` is a list of integers created from user input, `ss` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ll` is a large number, `avg` is half of the large number**
