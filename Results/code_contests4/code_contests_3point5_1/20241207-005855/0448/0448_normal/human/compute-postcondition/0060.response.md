Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `pidx` is increased by 1, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pidx` is increased by 1, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `lefttime`, `alsotoright`, `remtime`, `furthestright` remain unchanged**
