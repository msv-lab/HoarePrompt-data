According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. 

Right before the loop, `furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `pidx` and the elements in `p` need to be checked. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`furthestright` is updated based on the calculation involving `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
