According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`. Right before the loop, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, and `pidx` is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be met:
1. `hidx` should be less than the length of list `h`.
2. `pidx` should be less than the length of list `p`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`works` is True, `hidx` is less than the length of list `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`**
