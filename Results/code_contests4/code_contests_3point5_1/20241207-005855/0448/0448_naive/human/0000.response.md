Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values and processes them.
- The binary search algorithm to find the minimum time required to read all the needed tracks is implemented correctly.
- The program handles all possible cases and edge cases such as when the number of tracks to read is equal to the number of disk heads, or when the tracks are already at the initial positions of the heads.
