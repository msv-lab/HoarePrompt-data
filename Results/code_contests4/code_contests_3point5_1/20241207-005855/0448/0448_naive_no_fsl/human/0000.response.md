Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input as described in the problem statement, then it calculates the minimum time required to read all the needed tracks. It uses a binary search approach to find the optimal time by checking if it is possible to read all tracks within that time. The logic of moving the heads and checking if all tracks can be read within the given time seems correct and aligns with the problem description. The program also handles edge cases such as when the heads are already positioned at the required tracks. Overall, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
