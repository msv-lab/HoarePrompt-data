You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vanya got n cubes. He decided to build a pyramid from them. Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows: the top level of the pyramid must consist of 1 cube, the second level must consist of 1 + 2 = 3 cubes, the third level must have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 cubes, and so on. Thus, the i-th level of the pyramid must have 1 + 2 + ... + (i - 1) + i cubes.

Vanya wants to know what is the maximum height of the pyramid that he can make using the given cubes.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104) — the number of cubes given to Vanya.

Output

Print the maximum possible height of the pyramid in the single line.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.**
def func():
    x = int(input())
    i = 0
    k = 1
    c = 0
    while x - (i + k) >= 0:
        i = i + k
        
        x = x - i
        
        c = c + 1
        
        k = k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of `k` minus 1, `k` is the initial value of `k` plus 1, `c` is the number of times the loop executed, `x` is less than the final value of `i`
    print(c)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer input `x`, calculates the sum of integers from 1 to a certain point based on `x`, and prints the number of iterations it took to reach a point where subtracting the sum from `x` results in a non-positive value. The function does not have return values and operates without taking any parameters.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
