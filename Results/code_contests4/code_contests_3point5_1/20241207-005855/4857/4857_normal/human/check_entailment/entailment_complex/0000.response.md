Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer input `n`, calculates the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes, and prints the result. The loop in the program iterates until it is not possible to build another level of the pyramid with the remaining cubes, which aligns with the problem description. The program counts the number of iterations it takes to reach this point and prints the maximum possible height of the pyramid. The logic of the program is correct and it produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
