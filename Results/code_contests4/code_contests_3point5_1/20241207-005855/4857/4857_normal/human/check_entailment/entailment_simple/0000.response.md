Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built using the given number of cubes. It iterates through the levels of the pyramid, calculating the number of cubes required for each level and subtracting them from the total number of cubes. It keeps track of the number of levels completed and prints the result at the end.

The program follows the problem description by ensuring that each level of the pyramid has the correct number of cubes as specified in the problem statement. It handles different input values within the specified range and calculates the maximum height of the pyramid accurately.
