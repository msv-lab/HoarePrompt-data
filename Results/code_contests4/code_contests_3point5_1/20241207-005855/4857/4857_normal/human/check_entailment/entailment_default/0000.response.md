Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer input `x`, calculates the sum of integers from 1 to a certain point based on `x`, and prints the number of iterations it took to reach a point where subtracting the sum from `x` results in a non-positive value. The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the maximum possible height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes by iterating over the levels of the pyramid and checking if the remaining number of cubes is enough to build the next level. The code handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
