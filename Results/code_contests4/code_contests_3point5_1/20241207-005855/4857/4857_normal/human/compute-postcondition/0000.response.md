Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, after execution, `x` will hold a value within that range based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer within that range.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer within that range.**
