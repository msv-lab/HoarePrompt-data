According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `x - (i + k)`. If the result of this expression is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `c` is 2, `x` is less than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to a value where the expression `x - (i + k)` is greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 3, `c` is 2, `x` is less than 3, for the loop to execute again the expression `x - (i + k)` needs to be greater than or equal to 0**
