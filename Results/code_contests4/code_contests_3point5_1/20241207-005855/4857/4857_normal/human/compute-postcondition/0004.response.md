According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `x - (i + k) >= 0`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, and `c` is 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` needs to be such that `x - (i + k)` is greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `k` is 1, `c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `x` must satisfy x - (i + k) >= 0**
