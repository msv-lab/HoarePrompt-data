Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated by subtracting the value of `i`, which is 1. The previous value of `x` is unknown, so the new value of `x` after execution is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `k` is 1, `c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `x` must satisfy x - (i + k) >= 0.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 1, `c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `x` must satisfy x - (i + k) >= 0**
