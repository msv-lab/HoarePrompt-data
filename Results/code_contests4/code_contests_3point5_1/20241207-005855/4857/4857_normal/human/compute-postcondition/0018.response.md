Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `k + 1`, where `k` is 3, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 6, `k` is 4, `c` is 3, `x` is less than 3.
Output State: **`i` is 6, `k` is 4, `c` is 3, `x` is less than 3**
