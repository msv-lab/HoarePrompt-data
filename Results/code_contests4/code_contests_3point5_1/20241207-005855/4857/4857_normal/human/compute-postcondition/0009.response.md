According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `i`, and `k`. If `x - (i + k)` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `c` is 1. This means `x - (i + k)` should be greater than or equal to 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` must satisfy x - (i + k) >= 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `x` must satisfy x - (i + k) >= 0**
