Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built using the given number of cubes. It iterates through the levels of the pyramid, subtracting the cubes needed for each level from the total number of cubes until it is not possible to build the next level. The final count of levels is then printed, which represents the maximum height of the pyramid. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output for all given examples.
