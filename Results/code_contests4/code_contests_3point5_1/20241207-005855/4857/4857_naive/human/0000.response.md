Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible height of the pyramid that can be built using the given number of cubes. It follows the logic described in the problem statement where the i-th level of the pyramid contains cubes from 1 to i. The program iterates through levels of the pyramid until there are enough cubes to build the next level. The output is the maximum height of the pyramid that can be built. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
