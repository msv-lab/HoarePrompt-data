Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The logic implemented in the program seems to be incorrect as it is trying to find Pythagorean triples and then checking if the sides of the triangle are divisible by the found triple. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem of determining whether a right triangle with legs of length a and b can be located on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes with integer coordinates.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
