Correctness: True

Explanation: The program iterates through all possible integer coordinates for the vertices of the triangle and checks if the sides are not parallel to the coordinate axes. It then checks if the given triangle with legs of length a and b can be formed using the Pythagorean theorem. If a valid triangle can be formed, it outputs the coordinates of the vertices. The logic seems to be correct and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
