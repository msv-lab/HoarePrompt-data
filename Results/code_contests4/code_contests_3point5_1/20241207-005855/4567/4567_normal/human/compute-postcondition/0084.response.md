Example Answer: 
The function `func_2` is called with arguments `j * mul1` and `i * mul1`. Since `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, and `k` represents the third trip in the list, the value of `mul1` is determined. Similarly, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`, and 'YES' has been passed as an argument to `func_2`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` represent the third trip in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, `i`, `j`, and `k` represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`, and 'YES' has been passed as an argument to `func_2`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, `i`, `j`, and `k` represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`, and 'YES' has been passed as an argument to `func_2`**
