Postcondition: ***For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, i, j, and k represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`. If i * mul1 is not equal to mul2 * j, the program does not return any specific value.***
