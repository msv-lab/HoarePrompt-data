Example Answer:
`mul1` is assigned the value of `a` divided by `k`. Since `a` is divisible by `k`, `mul1` will be an integer value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute the first time, trips is a list of trips with at least 1 trip, i, j, and k represent the first trip in the list. Additionally, a is divisible by k and b is divisible by k, mul1 is an integer value.
