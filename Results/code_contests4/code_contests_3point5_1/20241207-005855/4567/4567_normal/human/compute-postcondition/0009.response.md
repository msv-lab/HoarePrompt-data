According to the code, the loop execution depends on the iterable `args`. For the loop to execute again, there must be more elements in `args` that have not been iterated over yet. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `at_start` is False, and args is a non-empty iterable. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `at_start` is False, args is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over**
