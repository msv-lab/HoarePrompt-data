Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `at_start` is unknown, but after execution, `at_start` is now `False`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `args` remain unchanged.
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `at_start` is False, args is a non-empty iterable**
