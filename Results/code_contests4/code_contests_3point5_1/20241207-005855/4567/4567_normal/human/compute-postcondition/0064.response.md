Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with arguments `j * mul1` and `i * mul1` where 'YES' is passed as an argument but does not affect any variables. The values of `j`, `i`, and `mul1` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact result of the function call. Therefore, the Output State is: No variables are affected by the function call 'func_2('YES')'.
Output State: **No variables are affected by the function call 'func_2('YES')'**
