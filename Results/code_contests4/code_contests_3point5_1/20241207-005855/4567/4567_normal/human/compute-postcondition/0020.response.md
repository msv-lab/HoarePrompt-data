Example Answer:
The 'end' key is popped from kwargs and written to the file. The 'end' key specifies the character to be appended at the end of the file, defaulting to a newline character. The values of 'a', 'b', at_start, and args remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, at_start is False, args is a non-empty iterable.
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, at_start is False, args is a non-empty iterable**
