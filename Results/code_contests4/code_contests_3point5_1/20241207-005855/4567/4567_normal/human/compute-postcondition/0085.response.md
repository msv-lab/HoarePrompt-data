Example Answer:
`func_2(-i * mul2, j * mul2)` is called with arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mul1`, and `mul2` are not explicitly given, so we cannot determine the exact values of the arguments. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, `i`, `j`, and `k` represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`, and 'YES' has been passed as an argument to `func_2`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, `i`, `j`, and `k` represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`, and 'YES' has been passed as an argument to `func_2`**
