Postcondition: ***a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute the first time, trips is a list of trips with at least 1 trip, i, j, and k represent the first trip in the list. Additionally, a is divisible by k and b is divisible by k, mul1 is an integer value, mul2 is the result of integer division of b by k. The condition (i * mul1 != mul2 * j) is false, which means i * mul1 is equal to mul2 * j.***
