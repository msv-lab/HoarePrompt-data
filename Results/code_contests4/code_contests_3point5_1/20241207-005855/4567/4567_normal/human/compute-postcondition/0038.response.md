According to the code, the loop will execute for values of j ranging from 1 to 1000. Since the loop needs to execute one more time with i being 1001, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, and `i` is now 1001.
State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time j ranges from 1 to 1000**
