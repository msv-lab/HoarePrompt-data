Example Answer:
The value of `k` is calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of `i` and `j`. Since `i` is 1001 and `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, the value of `k` will vary depending on the value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j**
