Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000. If a % k == 0 and b % k == 0 for all trips in the list, the loop will return 'YES' indicating the successful comparison of i * mul1 and mul2 * j. If the condition (i * mul1 != mul2 * j) is never met, the loop will not return any specific value.**
