The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The program has three possible cases of output:
Case_1: The program returns nothing.
Case_2: The program returns 'YES'.
Case_3: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return value specified in the code snippet. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to have three possible cases of output: returning nothing, returning 'YES', or having no explicit return value specified.
