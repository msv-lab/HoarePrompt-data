Example Answer:
The list `trips` is appended with a sublist containing values `[i, j, k]` where `i` is 1001, `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, and `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j, which is guaranteed to be an integer. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j, `k` is an integer, and a sublist `[i, j, k]` is appended to the list `trips`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j, `k` is an integer, and a sublist `[i, j, k]` is appended to the list `trips`**
