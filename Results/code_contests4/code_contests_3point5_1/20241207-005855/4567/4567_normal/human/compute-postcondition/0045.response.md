Example Answer:
The code calculates the value of `k` as the square root of the sum of squares of `i` and `j`. As given, the initial values of `i` and `j` are 1001 and 1 respectively. Therefore, `k` is calculated as the square root of (1001^2 + 1^2), which results in an integer value. The list `[1001, 1, k]` is appended to the list `trips`. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and 1001, and k is an integer, a sublist `[1001, 1, k]` is appended to the list `trips`.**
