Example Answer:
A new list [i, j, k] is appended to the trips list. The values of i, j, and k can range from 1 to 1000 as per the initial state. Therefore, the trips list now contains all possible unique lists [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 1000**
