According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more trips in the list. At the end of the last iteration, trips has at least 2 trips, i, j, and k represent the second trip in the list. Additionally, a is divisible by k and b is divisible by k. Mul1 is an integer value obtained from the integer division of a by k. Mul2 is the result of integer division of b by k. The condition (i * mul1 != mul2 * j) is false, which means i * mul1 is equal to mul2 * j. Therefore, if a % k == 0 and b % k == 0, the program returns 'YES' indicating the successful comparison of i * mul1 and mul2 * j.

State: **For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, i, j, and k represent the third trip in the list.**
