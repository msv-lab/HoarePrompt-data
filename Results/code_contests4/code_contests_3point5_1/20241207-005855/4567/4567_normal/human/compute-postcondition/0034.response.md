Example Answer:
A new list [i, j, k] is appended to the trips list. Since j is always assigned the value 1001, the list will look like [i, 1001, k]. The values of i and k can vary from 1 to 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, 1001, k] where i and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, k ≤ 1000.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, 1001, k] where i and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, k ≤ 1000**
