Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to a stream specified by `file` with a separator `sep`. If the `flush` keyword argument is True, it flushes the stream. The function does not calculate the sum of two random integers a and b as the annotations suggest.**
