According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in `args` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args` to iterate over.
State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args`**
