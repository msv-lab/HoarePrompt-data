Example Answer:
Initially, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j. In addition, `k` is an integer.

After executing the code `k = int(k)`, `k` is converted to an integer. Since `k` was already an integer, the conversion does not change its value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j, `k` is an integer.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j, `k` is an integer**
