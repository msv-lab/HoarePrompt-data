According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is a non-empty iterable (such as a list, tuple, etc.), the loop will execute. 
Before the loop starts, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, and at_start is True. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to set `args` as a non-empty iterable. 
State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, at_start is True, for the loop to execute `args` is a non-empty iterable**
