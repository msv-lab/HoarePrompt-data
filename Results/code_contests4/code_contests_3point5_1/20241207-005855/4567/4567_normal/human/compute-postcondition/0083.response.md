Example Answer:
`func_2` is called with arguments 0 and 0, so the function is executed with those arguments. The values of the arguments do not affect the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, i, j, and k represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`, and 'YES' has been passed as an argument to func_2.
