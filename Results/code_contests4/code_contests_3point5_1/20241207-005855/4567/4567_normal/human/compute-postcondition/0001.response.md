Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of the 'sep' key in the 'kwargs' dictionary to the variable 'sep', and the value of the 'file' key in the 'kwargs' dictionary to the variable 'file'. If 'sep' key is not present in 'kwargs', the default value ' ' (space) is assigned to 'sep'. If 'file' key is not present in 'kwargs', the default value 'sys.stdout' is assigned to 'file'. Since the initial state does not provide information about the 'kwargs' dictionary, we can't determine the exact values of 'sep' and 'file'. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000**
