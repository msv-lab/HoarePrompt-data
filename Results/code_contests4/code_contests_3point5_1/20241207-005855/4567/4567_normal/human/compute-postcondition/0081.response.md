The value of `mul2` is assigned the floor division of `b` divided by `k`. The previous values of `b` and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, i, j, and k represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, i, j, and k represent the third trip in the list, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` divided by `k`, `mul2` is the floor division of `b` divided by `k`**
