According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than 1001, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and 1001, and it is an integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1 and `k` should be recalculated as the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and the new value of `j`, and it must be an integer.
State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and the new value of `j`, k is an integer, a sublist `[1001, 1, k]` is appended to the list `trips`**
