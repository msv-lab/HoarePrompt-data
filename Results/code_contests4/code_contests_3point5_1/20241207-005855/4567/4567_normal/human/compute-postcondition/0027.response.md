Example Answer: 
The variable `k` is assigned the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`. Since `i` and `j` are integers and their squares are added and squared root is taken, `k` will also be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying the conditions mentioned above**
