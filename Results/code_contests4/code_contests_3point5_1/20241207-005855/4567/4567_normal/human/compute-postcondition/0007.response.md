Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is converted to a string using `str(x)`, and then written to the file using `file.write()`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, at_start is either True or False, args is a non-empty iterable.
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, at_start is either True or False, args is a non-empty iterable**
