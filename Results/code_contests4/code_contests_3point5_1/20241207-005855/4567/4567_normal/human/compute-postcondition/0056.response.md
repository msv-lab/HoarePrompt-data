Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values returned by the function `get_list()`. The function `get_list()` returns a list of two integers. The values of `a` and `b` can be any integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000**
