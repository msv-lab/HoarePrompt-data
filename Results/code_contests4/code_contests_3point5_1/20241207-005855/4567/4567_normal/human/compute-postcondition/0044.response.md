According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1001, `j` is 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and j. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should range from 1 to 1000, and `k` should be an integer. This means that `k` should be the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and 1001, resulting in an integer value.
State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, `i` is 1001, for the loop to execute the next time `j` ranges from 1 to 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of squares of 1001 and 1001, and k is an integer, a sublist `[i, j, k]` is appended to the list `trips`.**
