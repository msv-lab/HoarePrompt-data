Example Answer:
The value of `k` is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`. Since `j` is 1001 and `i` can vary from 1 to 1000, `k` will be calculated accordingly for each unique list in the trips list. The initial state remains unchanged.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 1000. If k is an integer, the program retains the initial state, `j` is 1001**
