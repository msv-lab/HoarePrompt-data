Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with the arguments `-i * mul2` and `j * mul2`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `mul2` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of the arguments passed to the function. Therefore, the Output State is: 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **'YES' is printed**
