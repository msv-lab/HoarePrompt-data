Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `int(k)`, where `k` is already an integer. The value of `k` remains the same. The value of `j` is set to 1001. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 1000. If k is an integer, `j` is 1001.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, trips list contains all possible unique lists [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 1000. If k is an integer, `j` is 1001**
