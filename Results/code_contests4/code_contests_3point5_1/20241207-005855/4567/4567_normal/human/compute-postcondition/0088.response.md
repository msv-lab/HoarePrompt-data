Postcondition: ***For the loop to execute the third time, trips is a list of trips with at least 3 trips, i, j, and k represent the third trip in the list. `a`, `b`, and `k` are integers. If `a` is divisible by `k` and `b` is divisible by `k`, `mul1` is the floor division of `a` by `k` and `mul2` is the floor division of `b` by `k`. If `i * mul1` is not equal to `mul2 * j`, the program does not return any specific value.***
