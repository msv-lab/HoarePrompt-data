Example Answer:
`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output state. However, this operation does not affect `a`, `b`, `at_start`, or `args`.
Output State: **No changes to the initial state**
