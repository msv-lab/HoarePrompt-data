#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` generates Pythagorean triples [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 1000. It then compares these triples to values a and b obtained from `get_list()`. If a % k == 0 and b % k == 0 for any triple, it performs certain calculations and calls `func_2` with specific arguments. The function can have three possible outputs: returning nothing, returning 'YES', or having no explicit return value specified.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, at_start is False, args is a non-empty iterable. The 'flush' key has been popped from kwargs and its value is True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing them to a stream specified by `file` with a separator `sep`. If the `flush` keyword argument is True, it flushes the stream. The function does not calculate the sum of two random integers a and b as the annotations suggest.
