Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program generates all possible Pythagorean triples [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 1000. It then compares these triples to the input values a and b. If a location exists where the right triangle can be placed such that none of its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the program outputs the appropriate coordinates of the vertices. The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
