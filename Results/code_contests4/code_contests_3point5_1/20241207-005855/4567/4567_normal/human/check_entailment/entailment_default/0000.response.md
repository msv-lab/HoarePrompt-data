Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly determine whether it is possible to locate a right triangle with legs of length a and b on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes and all vertices have integer coordinates. The `func_1` function generates Pythagorean triples [i, j, k] within the range 1 to 1000 and compares them to the input values a and b. If a solution exists, it outputs the appropriate coordinates of the triangle vertices. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description, and the output hints also support the correct functionality of the program. Since the code seems to handle all potential cases as per the problem description and the output hints, the correctness is deemed as True.
