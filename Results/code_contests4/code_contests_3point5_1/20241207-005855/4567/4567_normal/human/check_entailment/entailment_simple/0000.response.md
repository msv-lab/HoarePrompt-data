Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it attempts to find a valid location for the right triangle with legs of length a and b, it does not output the correct coordinates of the triangle vertices as required by the problem description. The `func_2` function seems to be incomplete and does not print the vertices as requested in the problem description. Additionally, the logic used in the `func_1` function to check for valid locations may not cover all possible cases where a valid location exists. Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for.
