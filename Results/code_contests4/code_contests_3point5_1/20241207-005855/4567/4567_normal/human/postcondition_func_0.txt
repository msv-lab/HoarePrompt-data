The function `func_1` generates Pythagorean triples [i, j, k] where i, j, and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 1000. It then compares these triples to values a and b obtained from `get_list()`. If a % k == 0 and b % k == 0 for any triple, it performs certain calculations and calls `func_2` with specific arguments. The function can have three possible outputs: returning nothing, returning 'YES', or having no explicit return value specified.
