Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the first card is a trump card and the second card is not a trump card. In this case, the first card should beat the second card regardless of their ranks. 

For example, if the input is:
```
H
QH 9S
```
The program should output "YES" but it will output "NO" because it does not consider the trump suit when comparing the cards.
