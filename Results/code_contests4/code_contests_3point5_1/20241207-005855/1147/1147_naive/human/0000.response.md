Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the rules of the "Durak" card game. 

An example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
S
8D 6D

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO

In this case, the first card (8D) should beat the second card (6D) because the suit of the second card (6D) is diamonds, which is not the trump suit (spades), and the rank of the first card (8) is higher than the rank of the second card (6). However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" in this case.
