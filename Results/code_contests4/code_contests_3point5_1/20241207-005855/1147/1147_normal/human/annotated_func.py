    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined, `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to numerical values. If the second element of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second element of `s` is not equal to `coz`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the condition (f[1] == coz and s[1] != coz) is false, then in the if part, if f[1] is equal to s[1] and f[0] is greater than the numerical value of s[0] in the dictionary `d`, the program's state is maintained.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not take any input arguments and reads input from the user using `raw_input()`. It then processes the input to determine certain conditions based on the values of the cards provided. The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions. The function utilizes a dictionary `d` to map card values to numerical values. However, the code raises a `NameError` due to the deprecated `raw_input()` function in Python 3. Overall, the function performs card comparison logic based on the input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
