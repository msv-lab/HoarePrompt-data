Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. One specific case where the code does not work as expected is when both cards have the same suit but the second card has a higher rank than the first card. In this case, the code will incorrectly print 'YES' instead of 'NO'. 

For example, if the input is:
```
H
9H QH
```
According to the game rules, the second card "QH" should beat the first card "9H" since they have the same suit "H" but the rank of the second card is higher. However, the code will output 'YES' instead of 'NO', which is incorrect. 

Hence, the code is not correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
