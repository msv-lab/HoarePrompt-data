Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not fully adhere to the problem description. The program only checks if the first card beats the second card based on their suits and ranks, but it does not consider the case where the first card is a trump card. According to the problem description, a trump card can beat any non-trump card regardless of their ranks. The program does not handle this case, so it is incorrect.
