Functionality: **The function does not take any input arguments and reads input from the user using `raw_input()`. It then processes the input to determine certain conditions based on the values of the cards provided. The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions. The function utilizes a dictionary `d` to map card values to numerical values. However, the code raises a `NameError` due to the deprecated `raw_input()` function in Python 3. Overall, the function performs card comparison logic based on the input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.**
