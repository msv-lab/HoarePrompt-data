Postcondition: ***NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined, `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to numerical values. The condition (f[1] == coz and s[1] != coz) is false. In the if part, if f[1] is equal to s[1] and f[0] is greater than the numerical value of s[0] in the dictionary `d`, then the program's state is maintained. In the else part, if f[1] is not equal to s[1] or f[0] is not greater than d[s[0]], then the program's state is maintained.***
