Example Answer:
The dictionary `d` is initialized with key-value pairs where the keys are strings representing card values and the values are their corresponding numerical values. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined, `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to numerical values.
Output State: **NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined, `d` is a dictionary mapping card values to numerical values**
