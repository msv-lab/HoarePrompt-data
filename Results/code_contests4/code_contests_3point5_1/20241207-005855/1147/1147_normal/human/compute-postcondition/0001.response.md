Example Answer:
The code snippet tries to split the input received from the function `raw_input()` into two separate variables `f` and `s`. However, the `raw_input()` function is not defined in Python 3, causing a NameError. As a result, the code cannot be executed successfully.
Output State: **NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined**
