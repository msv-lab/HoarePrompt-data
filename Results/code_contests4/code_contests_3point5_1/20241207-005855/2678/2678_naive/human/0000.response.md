Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input grid of squares correctly.
2. The function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum distance of white squares from the black squares.
3. The program then prints the number of operations required to turn all white squares to black, which is the maximum distance found in step 2.
4. The logic of checking adjacent squares and updating the distances is correctly implemented.
5. The program handles the case where the initial grid has at least one black square, as mentioned in the problem description.
6. The program works correctly for all potential cases and inputs described in the problem statement.
