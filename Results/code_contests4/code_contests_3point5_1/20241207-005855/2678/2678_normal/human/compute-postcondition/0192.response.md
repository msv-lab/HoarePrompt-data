Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements that satisfy the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'. `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell during the loop execution. The grid is updated with values representing the distance from the original cell `[i, j]` in the input grid.**
