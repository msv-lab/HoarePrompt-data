Postcondition: ***After the if condition, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates with at least one more coordinate, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations. Additionally, `r` is within the range of 0 to `H`, `c` is within the range of 0 to `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
