Example Answer:
`maxx` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`. The value of `maxx` can change depending on the comparison. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements including the newly appended one, `maxx` holds the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements including the newly appended one, `maxx` holds the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1.**
