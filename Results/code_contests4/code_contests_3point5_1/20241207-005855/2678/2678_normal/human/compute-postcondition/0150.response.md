Output State: **After executing the code, the coordinates [r, c] will be appended to the list `qq`. The other variables such as `H`, `W`, `dist`, `j`, `i`, and `maxx` will remain unchanged. The grid will be updated with the shortest path distances and the coordinates of the path will be correctly stored in `qq`. `maxx` will be updated to hold the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`.**
