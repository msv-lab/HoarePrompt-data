Example Answer:
The code appends the coordinates [i, j] to the list `q`. The initial state mentions that `q` contains the coordinates of the black square [i, j], so after executing the code, the coordinates [i, j] will be added to the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of the black square [i, j], `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time.
Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of the black square [i, j], `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time**
