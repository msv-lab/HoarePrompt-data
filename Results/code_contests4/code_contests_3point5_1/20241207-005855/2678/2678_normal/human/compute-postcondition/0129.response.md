According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j` within the boundaries of the grid and the condition `grid[r][c] == '.'`. If the condition is met, the grid is updated and `q`, `qq`, and `maxx` are modified accordingly.

At the end of the last iteration, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and grid[r][c]. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the new coordinates [r, c] must be within the boundaries of the grid and the value at that position must be '.'.

State: **`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and grid[r][c].**
