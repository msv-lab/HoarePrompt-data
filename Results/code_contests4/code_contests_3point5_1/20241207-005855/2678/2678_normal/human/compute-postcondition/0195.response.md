Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements. Additionally, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
