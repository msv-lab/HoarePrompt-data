Example Answer:
The value at position `grid[i][j]` is updated to 0, with `i` being updated to a new value less than `H+1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters with updated value at position `i`, `j`, `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is 1, `i` is updated to a new value less than `H+1`.
Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters with updated value at position `i`, `j`, `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is 1, `i` is updated to a new value less than `H+1`**
