Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a 2D list of characters representing a grid with at least one black square. It replaces all black squares with 0, calculates the shortest path distances from the starting point, and returns the maximum shortest path distance value stored in variable 'maxx' after all iterations of the loop have finished. **

Note: The code seems to accurately perform the functionality described in the annotations without missing any important edge cases.
