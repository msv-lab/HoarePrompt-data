According to the code, the loop will execute `H` times where `H` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `H` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 0, `W`, `q`, and `dist` remain unchanged, each index of `dist` contains an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
