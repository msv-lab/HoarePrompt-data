Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point, `q` will be an empty list, `H` and `W` will remain the same, `dist` will remain unchanged, `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`, `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value, and `qq` will contain the coordinates of the shortest path.**
