According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the `q` list is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `grid`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `j`, `i`, `maxx`, and `q` have specific conditions that need to be met for the loop to execute one more time. The `qq` list contains all the coordinates that have been appended during the loop iterations.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `q` should not be empty.
- `maxx` should be updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]` for all valid coordinates.
- Update `q` with the contents of `qq`.

State: **After all the loop iterations, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]` for all valid coordinates, and `qq` contains all the coordinates that have been appended during the loop iterations, and `q` is assigned the value of `qq` for the loop to execute again.**
