Postcondition: ***grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. If the square at position [i, j] is a black square, it is now set to 0. The variables H and W are greater than 0. The list q contains the coordinates of all the black squares. The list dist remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. The variable j is less than W. For the loop to execute again, i must be less than H+1. The list q contains the coordinates [i, j].***
