Postcondition: ***`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates with at least one more coordinate, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H + 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations. If 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.'), `grid` is updated with the value at position `[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains all the coordinates `[r, c]` that have been appended during the loop iterations.***
