Postcondition: ***`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0. If 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.', then grid is updated with the value grid[i][j] + 1. `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and grid[r][c].***
