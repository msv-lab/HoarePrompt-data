Example Answer:
`[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements including the newly appended one, `maxx` holds the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements including the newly appended one, `maxx` holds the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1.**
