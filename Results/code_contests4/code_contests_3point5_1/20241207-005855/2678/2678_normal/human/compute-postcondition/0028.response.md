Example Answer:
The code appends the current coordinates [i, j] to the list `q`. The list `q` now contains all the coordinates of the black squares. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is less than W, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1.
