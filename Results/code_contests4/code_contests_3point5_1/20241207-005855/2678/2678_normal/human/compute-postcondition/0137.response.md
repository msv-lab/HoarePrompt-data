Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point, `q` will not be empty, `H` and `W` will remain the same, `dist` will remain unchanged, `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`, `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value, `qq` will contain the coordinates of the shortest path, and the coordinates [i+1, j], [i-1, j], [i, j+1], [i, j-1] must be within the boundaries of the grid represented by `H` and `W`, and (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.'))***
