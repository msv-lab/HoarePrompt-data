According to the code, the loop will execute `H` times, where `H` is the number of rows in the grid. Therefore, the `H` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. 

Before the loop starts, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, so it meets the condition. 

`q` is an empty list, which is not used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

`dist` is a list of zeros with length equal to the number of rows in the grid, so it also meets the condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `H` is greater than 0.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 0, `W`, `q`, and `dist` remain unchanged**
