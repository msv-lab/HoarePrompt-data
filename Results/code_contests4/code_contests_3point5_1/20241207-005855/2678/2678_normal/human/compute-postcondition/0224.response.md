Example Answer:
The value of `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. The values of `r` and `c` are already present in the list `qq`, and `i` and `j` are not mentioned in the initial state. To execute the loop one more time, `q` must have more elements. The maximum value assigned to any grid cell is stored in `maxx`. Therefore, the Output State is: `qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements.
Output State: **`qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements**
