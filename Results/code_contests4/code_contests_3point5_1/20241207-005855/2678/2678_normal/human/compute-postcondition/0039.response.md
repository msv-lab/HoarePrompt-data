Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. Any black square in the grid is set to 0 after the loop execution. The list `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares in the grid. The variable `H` is greater than 0. The variable `W` is greater than 0. The list `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. The variable `j` is equal to `W`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `H+1`.**
