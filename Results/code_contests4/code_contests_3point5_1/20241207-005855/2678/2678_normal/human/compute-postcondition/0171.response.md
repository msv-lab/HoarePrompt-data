Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `grid` will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variable `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path.**
