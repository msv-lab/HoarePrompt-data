Output State: After the execution of the if-else block, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` and `W` are still greater than 0. `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` contains the appended coordinates [r, c] in the list for the next iteration of the loop. The value at grid[r][c] is updated to the value of grid[i][j] + 1.
