According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `H`. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, and `j` is equal to W-1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than `H+1`.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is equal to W-1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`**
