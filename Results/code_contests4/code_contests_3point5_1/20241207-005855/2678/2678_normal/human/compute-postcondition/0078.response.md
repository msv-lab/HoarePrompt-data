According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are coordinates in the list [[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]. Since `q` contains all the black square coordinates, the next coordinates (x, y) should be taken from `q` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid with all black squares replaced with 0, `q` contains all the black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations, for the loop to execute one more time the next coordinates in `q` are (x, y)**.
