Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`. `maxx` is 0**
