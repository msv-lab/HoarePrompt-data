According to the code, the loop can execute based on the values of `i`, `j`, `H`, `W`, `r`, `c`, and the conditions specified. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `H`, `j` is equal to `W`, and the queue `q` is not empty. To execute the loop one more time, the values of `r` and `c` must be such that they satisfy the conditions 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, the values of `grid` will be updated with the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will not be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variables `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path. The next iteration of the loop will execute if the values of `r` and `c` are such that they satisfy the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'.**
