Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements including the newly appended one. `maxx` is updated to hold the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements. `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to `grid[i][j] + 1. `grid[r][c]` is updated to be equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` appends a new list `[r, c]`.***
