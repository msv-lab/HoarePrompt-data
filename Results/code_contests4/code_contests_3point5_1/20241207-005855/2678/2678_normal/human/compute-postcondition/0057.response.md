According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `q` is not empty. Right before the loop, `q` contains coordinates of black squares in the grid, so it must not be empty for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` must be less than `H+1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, `maxx` is 0, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1` and `q` must not be empty**
