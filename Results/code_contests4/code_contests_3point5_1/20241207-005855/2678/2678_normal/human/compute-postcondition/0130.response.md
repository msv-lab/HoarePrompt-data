Example Answer:
`grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, where `i` and `j` are the previous coordinates. `maxx` is updated to hold the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`. The states of `q` and `qq` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`**
