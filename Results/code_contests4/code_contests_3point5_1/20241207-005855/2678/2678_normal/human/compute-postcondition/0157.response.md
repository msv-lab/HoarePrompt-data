Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at grid[r][c] is updated with the value of grid[i][j] + 1. The values of H, W, dist, j, i, maxx, and qq remain unchanged. The loop will only execute if 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'.
