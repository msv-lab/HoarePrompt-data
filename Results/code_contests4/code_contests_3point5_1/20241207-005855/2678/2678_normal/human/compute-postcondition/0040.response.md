According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares in the grid, `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is equal to `W`, and `i` is equal to `H`. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `H+1`, which means `i` needs to be equal to `H-1` in order to satisfy the condition.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares in the grid, `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`**
