Example Answer:
The code appends the list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. The previous state of `qq` contains all valid `[r, c]` elements, and now it will have an additional element `[r, c]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements plus the newly appended `[r, c]`, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements.
Output State: **`qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements plus the newly appended `[r, c]`, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements**
