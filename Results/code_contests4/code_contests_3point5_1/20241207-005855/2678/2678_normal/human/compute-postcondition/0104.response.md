Example Answer:
`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`. The previous value of `maxx` is unknown, but after this execution, `maxx` will be updated accordingly. The other variables `grid` and `qq` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with the value at position `[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains all the coordinates `[r, c]` that have been appended during the loop iterations.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with the value at position `[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains all the coordinates `[r, c]` that have been appended during the loop iterations**
