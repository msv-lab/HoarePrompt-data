Postcondition: ***`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and the character at position `grid[r][c]` if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.'.***
