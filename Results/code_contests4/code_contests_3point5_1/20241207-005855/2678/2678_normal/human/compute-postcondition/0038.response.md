Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains coordinates [i, j+1], `j` is incremented and `j` is less than `W+1. If the square at position [i][j] is a black square represented by '#', then the program updates `q` to contain the coordinates [i, j+1].***
