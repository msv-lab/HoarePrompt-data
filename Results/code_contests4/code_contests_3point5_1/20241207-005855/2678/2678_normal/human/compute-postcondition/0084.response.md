According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j` and the coordinates in the list. If there are more coordinates in `q` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c] + 1`, `qq` contains all coordinates [r, c] appended during the loop iterations, and the next coordinates in `q` are (x, y). So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more coordinates in `q` to iterate over and the next coordinates should be (x, y).
State: **After the execution of the if block, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c] + 1`, `qq` contains all coordinates [r, c] appended during the loop iterations, and for the loop to execute one more time, the next coordinates in `q` are (x, y)**.
