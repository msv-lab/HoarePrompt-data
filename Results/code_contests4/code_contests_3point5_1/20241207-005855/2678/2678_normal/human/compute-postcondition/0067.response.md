Example Answer:
The value at position `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`. The values of `r` and `c` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `grid[r][c]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if-else block, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` and `W` are still greater than 0. `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` remains an empty list. For the loop to execute the next time, the next coordinate in `q` will be determined.
