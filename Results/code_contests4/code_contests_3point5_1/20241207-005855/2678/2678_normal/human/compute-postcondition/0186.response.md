Postcondition: ***`qq` is a list. If 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.'), then `qq` is updated to contain an additional element [r, c]. `maxx` is updated, and `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j]` + 1. The conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.' are satisfied after the execution of the if-else block.***
