According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width of the grid `W`. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `W` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and remain less than `W`.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `grid[i][j]` is equal to '#', then the square at coordinates [i, j] is replaced with 0, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of the black square [i, j], `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
