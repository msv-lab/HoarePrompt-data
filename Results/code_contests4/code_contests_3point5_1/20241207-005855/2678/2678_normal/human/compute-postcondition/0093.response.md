Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c] + 1`, `qq` contains all coordinates [r, c] appended during the loop iterations, for the loop to execute one more time the next coordinates in `q` are (x, y), `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`.***
