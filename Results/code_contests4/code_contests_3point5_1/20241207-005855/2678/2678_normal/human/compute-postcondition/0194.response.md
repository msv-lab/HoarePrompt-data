According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list [[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]. If the list has at least one element, the loop can execute. After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements, so for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements. Also, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell during the loop execution.

State: **After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid [r, c] elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements**
