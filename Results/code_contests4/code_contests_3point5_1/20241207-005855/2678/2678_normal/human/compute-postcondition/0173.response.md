According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the queue `q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the queue `q` is empty. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the queue `q` needs to be non-empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `grid` will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` is empty. The values of `H` and `W` remain unchanged. The `dist` remains the same. The variable `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` holds the maximum shortest path distance value. The `qq` list contains the coordinates of the shortest path. For the loop to execute one more time, the queue `q` needs to be non-empty**
