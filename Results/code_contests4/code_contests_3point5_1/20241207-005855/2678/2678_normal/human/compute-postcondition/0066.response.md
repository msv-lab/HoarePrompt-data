According to the code, the loop can execute based on the coordinates `(r, c)` and the dimensions `H` and `W`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0, `q` stores the coordinates of black squares, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, `maxx` is updated, and `qq` is an empty list. To execute the loop again, the next coordinate in `q` must be determined. Since the loop iterates over the coordinates `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]`, the next coordinate will be `[i + 1, j]` which means `i` needs to increase by 1.
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` and `W` are still greater than 0. `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` remains an empty list. For the loop to execute the next time, the next coordinate in `q` will be determined.**
