Output State: **After executing the code, the `qq` list is initialized as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged: `grid` updated with shortest path distances, `q` is empty, `H` and `W` remain the same, `dist` unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` holds the maximum shortest path distance value, and `qq` contains the coordinates of the shortest path.**
