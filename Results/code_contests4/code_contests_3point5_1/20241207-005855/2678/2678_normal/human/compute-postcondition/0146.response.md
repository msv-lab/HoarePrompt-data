Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the grid will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will not be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variable `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path, and [r, c] will be appended to it if (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.')). The coordinates [i+2, j], [i, j], [i+1, j+1], [i+1, j-1] must be within the boundaries of the grid represented by `H` and `W`. The grid will be updated with the shortest path distances and the coordinates of the path will be correctly stored in `qq`.***
