Example Answer: 
A new empty list is assigned to the ith index of the `dist` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 0, `W`, `q`, and `dist` remain unchanged, and a new empty list is assigned to the ith index of `dist`.
Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 0, `W`, `q`, and `dist` remain unchanged, and a new empty list is assigned to the ith index of `dist`**
