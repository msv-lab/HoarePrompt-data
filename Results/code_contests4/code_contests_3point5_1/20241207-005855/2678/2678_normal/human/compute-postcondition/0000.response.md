Example Answer: 
`H` is assigned the value of the length of `grid`, which represents the number of rows in the grid. `W` is assigned the value of the length of `grid[0]`, which represents the number of columns in the grid. The values of `H` and `W` are calculated based on the initial state of the grid. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is the number of rows in the grid; `W` is the number of columns in the grid.
Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is the number of rows in the grid; `W` is the number of columns in the grid**
