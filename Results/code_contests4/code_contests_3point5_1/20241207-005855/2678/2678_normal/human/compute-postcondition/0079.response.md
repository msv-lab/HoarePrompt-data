Postcondition: ***After the if condition is met, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid with all black squares replaced with 0, `q` contains all the black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations, for the loop to execute one more time the next coordinates in `q` are (x, y). Additionally, after entering the if condition, 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'***
