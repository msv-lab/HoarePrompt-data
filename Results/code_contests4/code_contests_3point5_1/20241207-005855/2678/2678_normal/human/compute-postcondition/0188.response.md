Example Answer:
`grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j]` + 1. The conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` == '.' are satisfied after the execution of the if-else block for the next iteration. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `qq` is updated with additional elements based on the next iteration values of r and c, `maxx` is updated, and `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j]` + 1.
Output State: **`qq` is updated with additional elements based on the next iteration values of r and c, `maxx` is updated, and `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j]` + 1**
