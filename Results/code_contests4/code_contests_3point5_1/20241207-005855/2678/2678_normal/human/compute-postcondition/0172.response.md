Example Answer:
The value of `q` is assigned the value of `qq`, updating the queue with the coordinates of the shortest path. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `grid` will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` is empty. The values of `H` and `W` remain unchanged. The `dist` remains the same. The variable `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` holds the maximum shortest path distance value. The `qq` list contains the coordinates of the shortest path.
