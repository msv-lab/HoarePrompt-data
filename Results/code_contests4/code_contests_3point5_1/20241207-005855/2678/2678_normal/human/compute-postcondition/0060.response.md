According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the coordinates (r, c) that are being iterated over in the list. For the loop to execute the first time, there must exist at least one coordinate (i, j) in `q`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that the first coordinate in `q` is used to set the initial values of `r` and `c`.

State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, `maxx` is 0, `qq` is an empty list. For the loop to execute the first time, the first coordinate in `q` is (i, j)**.
