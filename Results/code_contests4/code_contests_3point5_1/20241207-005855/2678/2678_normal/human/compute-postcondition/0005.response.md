According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `H` is greater than 0. Since a new empty list is assigned to the ith index of `dist`, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than `H - 1`.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 0, `W`, `q`, and `dist` remain unchanged, and a new empty list is assigned to the (i+1)th index of `dist` for the loop to execute a second time**
