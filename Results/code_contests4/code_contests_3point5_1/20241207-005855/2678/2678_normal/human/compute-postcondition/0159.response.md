Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the values of `grid` will be updated with the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will not be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variables `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path. If the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.' are met, the value at grid[r][c] will be updated with the value of grid[i][j] + 1. The coordinates [r, c] will be appended to the `qq` list. The loop will only execute if the stated conditions are satisfied.***
