Example Answer:
`maxx` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the value of the grid cell at position `[r, c]`. The previous value of `maxx` is unknown, but after the execution, `maxx` will hold the maximum value between its previous value and the value of the grid cell at position `[r, c]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements.
Output State: **`qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements**
