The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `grid`, which is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. Each character in the grid is either '#' for a black square or '.' for a white square. The function returns the maximum shortest path distance value stored in variable 'maxx' after executing all iterations of the loop.
