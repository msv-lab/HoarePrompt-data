Postcondition: ***grid will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue q will not be empty. The values of H and W will remain unchanged. The dist will remain the same. The variable j will be equal to W, i will be equal to H. The variable maxx will hold the maximum shortest path distance value. The qq list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path. The loop will only execute if 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'.***
