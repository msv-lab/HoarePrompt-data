Example Answer: 
The value at position `grid[r][c]` is appended to the list `qq`. The variable `maxx` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`**
