According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of the black square [i, j], `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, and `j` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of the black square [i, j], `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time.**
