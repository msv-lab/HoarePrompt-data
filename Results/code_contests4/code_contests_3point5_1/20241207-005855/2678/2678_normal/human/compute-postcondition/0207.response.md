Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. Since `grid[r][c]` is updated to be `grid[i][j] + 1`, the new value of `maxx` is the maximum between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is updated to be equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`.
Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to be equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`**
