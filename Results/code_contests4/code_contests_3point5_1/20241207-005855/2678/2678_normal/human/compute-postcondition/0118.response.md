According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the coordinates in `q`. If `q` contains at least 1 coordinate pair, the loop can execute. At the start of the first iteration, `(i, j)` needs to be the first coordinate pair in `q`. For the loop to be executed the first time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains at least 1 coordinate pair, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]` for all valid coordinates, `qq` is an empty list, `q` is assigned the value of `qq`, for the loop to execute the first time `(i, j)` is the first coordinate pair in `q`**
