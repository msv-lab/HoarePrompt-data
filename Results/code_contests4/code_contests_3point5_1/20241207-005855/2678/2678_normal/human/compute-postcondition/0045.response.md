Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. The black square at position [H-1, 0] is replaced with 0. `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares in the grid including [H-1, 0]. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is 0, `i` is `H-1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`.***
