The code appends the coordinates [i, j] to the list `q`. Since `i` is `H-1` and `j` is 0, the coordinates [H-1, 0] are added to the list `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares in the grid including [H-1, 0], `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `H-1`.
Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares in the grid including [H-1, 0], `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `H-1`**
