Example Answer:
Adding a new list `[r, c]` to the list `qq`. This means that the list `qq` now contains an additional element `[r, c]`. Other variables like `q`, `i`, `j`, `H`, `W`, and `grid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `qq` contains the added element `[r, c]`.
Output State: **`qq` contains the added element `[r, c]`**
