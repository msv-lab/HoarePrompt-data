Postcondition: ***`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates with at least one more coordinate, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is updated to `H + 2`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]` from the new coordinates, `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations. Additionally, if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and `grid[r][c]` == '.', then `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`***
