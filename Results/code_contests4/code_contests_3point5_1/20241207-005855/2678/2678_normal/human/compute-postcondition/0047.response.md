Example Answer:
A new coordinate [i, j] is appended to the list `q`. Since [H-1, 0] is already in `q`, this operation adds another black square to the list. The values of `H`, `W`, `dist`, and `j` remain unchanged. Now, the loop can execute again as `i` has been updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. The black squares in the grid are represented by the coordinates in `q`. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is 1, `i` is updated to a new value less than `H+1`.
