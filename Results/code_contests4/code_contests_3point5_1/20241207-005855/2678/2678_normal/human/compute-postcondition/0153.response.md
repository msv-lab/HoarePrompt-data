According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the queue `q` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances, `q` will not be empty, `H` will be equal to `i`, `W` will be equal to `j`, `dist` will remain the same, `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value, and `qq` will contain the coordinates of the shortest path. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the queue `q` must still not be empty.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` will be updated with the values of the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will not be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variable `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path.**
