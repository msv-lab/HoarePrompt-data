Output State: **After appending the coordinates [r, c] to `qq`, the variables remain as follows: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid, `q` contains coordinates of black squares, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `dist` still contains empty lists, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` now contains the appended coordinates [r, c] in the list.**
