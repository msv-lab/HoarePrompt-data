Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is less than W, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1. When the condition `grid[i][j] == '#'` is true, the square at position (i, j) is a black square***
