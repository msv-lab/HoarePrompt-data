Output State: `H` and `W` remain unchanged, `dist` remains the same, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` holds the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` list contains the coordinates of the shortest path, `[r, c]` is appended to `qq` if conditions are met, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`.
