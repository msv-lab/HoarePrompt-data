Example Answer:
The code appends the coordinates [r, c] to the list `qq`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `q` contains all black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c] + 1`, `qq` contains all coordinates [r, c] appended during the loop iterations, and for the loop to execute one more time, the next coordinates in `q` are (x, y), `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **After the execution, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `q` contains all black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c] + 1`, `qq` contains all coordinates [r, c] appended during the loop iterations, and for the loop to execute one more time, the next coordinates in `q` are (x, y), `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`.**
