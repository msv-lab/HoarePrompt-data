Example Answer:
The list `qq` appends a new list `[r, c]`. This means that the variables `r` and `c` are added to the list `qq`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is updated to be equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, `qq` appends a new list `[r, c]`.
Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is updated to be equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, `qq` appends a new list `[r, c]`**
