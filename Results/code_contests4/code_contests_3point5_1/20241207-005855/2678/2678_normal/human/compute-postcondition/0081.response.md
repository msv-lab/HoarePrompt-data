Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, which is `grid[i][j] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`.
Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`**
