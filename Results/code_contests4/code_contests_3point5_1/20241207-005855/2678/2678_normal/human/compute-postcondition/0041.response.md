According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `W`. Since `j` is equal to `W`, the loop will execute if `W` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `W` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `H-1`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares in the grid, `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `H-1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`**
