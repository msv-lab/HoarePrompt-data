Postcondition: ***`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0. `q` contains at least 1 coordinate pair. `H` and `W` are still greater than 0. `dist` remains unchanged. `j` is equal to `W`. `i` is equal to `H`. `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]` for all valid coordinates. `qq` is an empty list. `q` is assigned the value of `qq`. For the loop to execute the first time, `(i, j)` is the first coordinate pair in `q`. If `0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.')`, then `grid` is updated with the value at position `grid[r][c]` incremented by 1. `q` is updated to an empty list. `qq` is updated with the new coordinate `[r, c]`. `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`.***
