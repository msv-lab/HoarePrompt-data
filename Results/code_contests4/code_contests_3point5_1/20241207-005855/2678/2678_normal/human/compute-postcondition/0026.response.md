According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `W`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `W`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `H+1`. 
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` and `W` are greater than 0, `q` contains the coordinates of all the black squares, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is less than W, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1**.
