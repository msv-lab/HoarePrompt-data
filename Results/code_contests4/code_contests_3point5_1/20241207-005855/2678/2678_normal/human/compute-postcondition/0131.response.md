Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated by taking the maximum value between its previous value and the value at position `grid[r][c]`. The previous value of `maxx` is unknown, but `grid[r][c]` is specified as a character. Therefore, the output state is: `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and the character at position `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` is an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate [r, c], and `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and the character at position `grid[r][c]`**
