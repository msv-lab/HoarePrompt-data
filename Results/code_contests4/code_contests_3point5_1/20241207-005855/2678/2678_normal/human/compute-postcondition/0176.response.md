According to the code, the loop can execute if `q` has at least 1 element. The loop iterates over a list of lists, where each inner list contains two elements. Before the loop starts, `qq` is an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `q` must have at least 1 element, and `i` and `j` are set according to the first element in `q`.

State: **`qq` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `q` has at least 1 element, `i` and `j` are set according to the first element in `q`**
