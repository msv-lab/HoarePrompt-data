Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]` for all valid coordinates, and `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations, and `q` is assigned the value of `qq`.**
