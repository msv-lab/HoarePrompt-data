Output State: **`grid` is now updated with the value at position `grid[r][c]` which is incremented by 1, `q` is updated to an empty list, `qq` is updated to an empty list, `H` is still greater than 0, `W` is still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]` for all valid coordinates, for the loop to execute the first time `(i, j)` is the first coordinate pair in `q`, `0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.') and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`**
