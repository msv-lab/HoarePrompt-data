According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are coordinates (i, j) in the list q. At the end of the loop, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0, and `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. For the loop to execute, the list `q` must have at least one coordinate (i, j). 

State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, `maxx` is 0, `qq` is an empty list. For the loop to execute the first time there exists at least one coordinate (i, j) in `q`**
