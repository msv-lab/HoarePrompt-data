Postcondition: ***`qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements. Additionally, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < H`, `c` is an integer such that `0 <= c < W`, and `grid[r][c] == '.'`. After the execution of the if statement, `maxx` is updated with the new maximum value, the values of grid cells at positions `[r, c]` and `[i, j]` are changed, `qq` contains valid `[r, c]` elements along with the newly appended element, and `q` must have more elements for another loop iteration.***
