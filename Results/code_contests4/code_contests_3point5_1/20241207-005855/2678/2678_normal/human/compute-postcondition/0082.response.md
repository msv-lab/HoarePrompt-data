Example Answer:
`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[i][j] + 1`, where the value of `grid[i][j]` is unknown. Then, `[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated based on the comparison with `grid[i][j] + 1`, `qq` contains the appended coordinates `[r, c]`.
Output State: **`maxx` is updated based on the comparison with `grid[i][j] + 1`, `qq` contains the appended coordinates `[r, c]`**
