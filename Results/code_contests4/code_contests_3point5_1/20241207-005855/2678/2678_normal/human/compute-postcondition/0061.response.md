Postcondition: ***After the if condition, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, `maxx` is 0, `qq` is an empty list. For the loop to execute the first time, the first coordinate in `q` is (i, j). Additionally, `(0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.'))`***
