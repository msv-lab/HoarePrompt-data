Example Answer:
The coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to the list `qq`, so the list `qq` now contains the coordinates of the shortest path including `[r, c]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` and `W` remain unchanged, `dist` remains the same, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` holds the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` list contains the coordinates of the shortest path including `[r, c]`, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`.
Output State: **`H` and `W` remain unchanged, `dist` remains the same, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` holds the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` list contains the coordinates of the shortest path including `[r, c]`, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`**
