Output State: **After the execution, the `grid` will be updated with the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will still not be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variables `j` will still be equal to `W`, `i` will still be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path. The next iteration of the loop will execute if the values of `r` and `c` satisfy the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'.**
