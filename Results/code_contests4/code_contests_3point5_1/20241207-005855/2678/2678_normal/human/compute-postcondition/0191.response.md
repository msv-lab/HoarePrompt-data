Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `qq` is updated with additional elements based on the next iteration values of `r` and `c`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value, and `grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j]` + 1. The conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.' are satisfied.***
