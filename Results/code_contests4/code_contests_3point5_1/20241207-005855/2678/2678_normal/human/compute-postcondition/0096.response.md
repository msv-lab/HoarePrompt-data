According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` and `j` are within the bounds of the grid, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **After all iterations of the loop, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares as 0, `q` contains all black square coordinates with at least one more coordinate, `H` and `W` are still greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is equal to `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations. For the loop to execute, `i` and `j` must be within the bounds of the grid.**
