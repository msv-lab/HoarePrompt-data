Example Answer:
`q` appends the coordinates `[i, j]`. The coordinates `[H-1, 2]` are added to `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters with the black square at position [H-1, 0] replaced with 0, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares including [H-1, 0] and [H-1, 2], `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list, `j` is 2, `i` is `H-1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`.
