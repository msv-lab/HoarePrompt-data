Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` and `W` are still greater than 0. `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value at position `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` contains all the coordinates [r, c] that have been appended during the loop iterations.**
