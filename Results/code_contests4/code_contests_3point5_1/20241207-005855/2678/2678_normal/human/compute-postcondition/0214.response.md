Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `qq` is a list containing all valid `[r, c]` elements, `maxx` holds the maximum value assigned to any grid cell during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have more elements. Additionally, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < H`, `c` is an integer such that `0 <= c < W`, `grid[r][c] == '.'`**
