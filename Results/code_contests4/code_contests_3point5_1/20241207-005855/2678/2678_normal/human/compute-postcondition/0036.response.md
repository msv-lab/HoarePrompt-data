Example Answer:
The coordinates [i, j] are appended to the list `q`. The previous values of `q`, `i`, and `j` are known. Therefore, the output state is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains coordinates [i, j], `j` is incremented and `j` is less than `W+1`.
Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `q` contains coordinates [i, j], `j` is incremented and `j` is less than `W+1`**
