Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` will be updated with the values representing the shortest path distances from the starting point. `q` will be empty. `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. `dist` will remain the same. `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`. `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value.**
