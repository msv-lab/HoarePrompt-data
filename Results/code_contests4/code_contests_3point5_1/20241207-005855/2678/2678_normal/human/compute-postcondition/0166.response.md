Output State: After the execution of the if-else block, the `grid` will be updated with the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will still not be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variables `j` will still be equal to `W`, `i` will still be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path and append the new coordinates `[r, c]` to it. The next iteration of the loop will execute if the values of `r` and `c` satisfy the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'. `grid[r][c]` will be updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`.
