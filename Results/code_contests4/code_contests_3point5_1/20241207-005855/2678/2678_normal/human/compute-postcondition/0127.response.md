Example Answer:
The new coordinate `[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with the value `grid[i][j] + 1`, `q` is still an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate `[r, c]`, `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with the value `grid[i][j] + 1`, `q` is still an empty list, `qq` contains the new coordinate `[r, c]`, `maxx` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `grid[r][c]`**
