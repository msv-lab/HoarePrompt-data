According to the code, the loop will execute for the next iteration if the new coordinates `[r, c]` satisfy the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the grid, queue `q`, `H`, `W`, `dist`, `j`, `i`, `maxx`, and `qq` will have specific values. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the new values of `r` and `c` need to be determined based on the previous iteration's values. Additionally, the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.' need to be met for the next iteration to occur.

State: **After the execution of the if-else block, the `grid` will be updated with the shortest path distances from the starting point. The queue `q` will still not be empty. The values of `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. The `dist` will remain the same. The variables `j` will still be equal to `W`, `i` will still be equal to `H`. The variable `maxx` will hold the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`. The `qq` list will contain the coordinates of the shortest path and append the new coordinates `[r, c]` to it. The next iteration of the loop will execute if the values of `r` and `c` satisfy the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and grid[r][c] == '.'.**
