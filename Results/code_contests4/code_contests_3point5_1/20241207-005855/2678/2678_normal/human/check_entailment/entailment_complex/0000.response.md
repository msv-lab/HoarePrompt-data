Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the grid, identifies black squares, replaces them with 0, and then calculates the shortest path distances from the black squares to white squares. The program continues this process until all white squares are turned black, and it returns the number of operations required to achieve this.

Therefore, the program always follows the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for every potential case.
