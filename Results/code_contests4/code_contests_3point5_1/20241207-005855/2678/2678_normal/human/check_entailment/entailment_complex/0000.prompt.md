You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns, where each square is painted white or black. HW characters from A_{11} to A_{HW} represent the colors of the squares. A_{ij} is `#` if the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is black, and A_{ij} is `.` if that square is white.

We will repeatedly perform the following operation until all the squares are black:

* Every white square that shares a side with a black square, becomes black.



Find the number of operations that will be performed. The initial grid has at least one black square.

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 1000
* A_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* The given grid has at least one black square.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
A_{11}A_{12}...A_{1W}
:
A_{H1}A_{H2}...A_{HW}


Output

Print the number of operations that will be performed.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. Each character in the grid is either '#' for a black square or '.' for a white square.**
def func_1(grid):
    H, W = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    q = []
    dist = [0] * H
    for i in range(H):
        dist[i] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `H` is greater than 0, `W`, `q`, and `dist` remain unchanged, and each index of `dist` contains an empty list
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if grid[i][j] == '#':
                q.append([i, j])
                grid[i][j] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares replaced with 0. All black square coordinates are stored in `q`. `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `dist` remains unchanged with each index containing an empty list. `j` is equal to `W`, `i` is `H-1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `H+1`.
    maxx = 0
    while q:
        qq = []
        
        for i, j in q:
            for r, c in [[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]:
                if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.':
                    grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1
                    maxx = max(maxx, grid[r][c])
                    qq.append([r, c])
        
        q = qq
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` will be updated with the values representing the shortest path distances from the starting point. `q` will be empty. `H` and `W` will remain unchanged. `dist` will remain the same. `j` will be equal to `W`, `i` will be equal to `H`. `maxx` will hold the maximum shortest path distance value.
    return maxx
    #The program returns the maximum shortest path distance value stored in variable 'maxx' after all iterations of the loop have finished.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a 2D list of characters representing a grid with at least one black square. It replaces all black squares with 0, calculates the shortest path distances from the starting point, and returns the maximum shortest path distance value stored in variable 'maxx' after all iterations of the loop have finished.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
