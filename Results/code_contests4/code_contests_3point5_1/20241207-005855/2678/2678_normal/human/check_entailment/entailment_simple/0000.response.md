Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the white squares that share a side with a black square and updates their values to represent the shortest path distances. It ensures that all white squares that are reachable from a black square are visited and updated.

The program maintains a queue `q` to keep track of the coordinates of the squares to be visited next. It continues this process until all reachable white squares are visited. The maximum distance value encountered during this process is returned as the number of operations performed.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly finds the number of operations that will be performed until all squares are black.
