Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` seems to be calculating the shortest path distances from the starting point to every other white square. However, the problem description states that every white square that shares a side with a black square becomes black. The code does not seem to address this condition, so it is incorrect.
