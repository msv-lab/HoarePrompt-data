Correctness: False

The provided code does not correctly implement the described problem. The function `func_1` seems to be calculating the maximum distance from a black square to a white square, rather than the number of operations needed to turn all white squares to black squares. The logic inside the function is not aligned with the problem description, and the output produced by the code is not the number of operations as required by the problem.

Therefore, based on the incorrect implementation of the logic to solve the problem, the correctness of the code is False.
