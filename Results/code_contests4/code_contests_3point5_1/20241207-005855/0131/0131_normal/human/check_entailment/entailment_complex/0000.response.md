Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array as described in the problem description. Instead, it simply prints the number 5 without performing any calculations based on the input array. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
