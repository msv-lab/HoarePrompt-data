Correctness: **False**

The given program simply prints the number 5 without performing any calculations based on the input array and k value. This does not align with the problem description, which requires calculating the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for any potential case.
