Correctness: True

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of moves required to reach a safe configuration of robbers based on the given problem description. The program calculates the relative positions of the robbers with respect to the searchlights and then uses binary search to find the minimum number of moves needed for a safe configuration.

The program considers all potential cases where a searchlight can see a robber and adjusts the positions of the robbers accordingly to ensure that no searchlight can see any robber. The binary search approach efficiently finds the minimum number of moves required.

Overall, the program covers all aspects of the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
