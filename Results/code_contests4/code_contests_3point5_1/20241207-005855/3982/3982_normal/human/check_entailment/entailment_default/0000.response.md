Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
Upon analyzing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code may not handle all potential cases correctly. The output hints also provide a scenario where the code might not work as expected.

The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration for the given robbers and searchlights. It iterates through combinations of robbers and lights, performs computations, and ultimately prints the final number of moves. However, there are potential issues with the implementation.

One specific case that the code may not handle correctly is when a searchlight can see a robber even after multiple moves. This situation could arise if the relative positions of the robbers and lights do not allow for a safe configuration within the constraints of the code. The code may not account for all scenarios where a safe configuration is not achievable.

Based on the analysis of the code and the output hints, it appears that there could be cases where the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect output. Hence, the correctness of the code is deemed as **False**.
