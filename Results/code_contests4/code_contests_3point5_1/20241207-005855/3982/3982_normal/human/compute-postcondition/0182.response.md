Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list are modified, `psum_min` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the sum of all elements in the `avail` list, `psum` is the sum of all elements in the `avail` list, if `psum_min` is equal to 0 then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`, if `psum_min` is not equal to 0 then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `l` is updated to `ans + 1`, `ans` is calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`, `ans` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is less than `r`, `i` is 1, `avail[i]` is 0**
