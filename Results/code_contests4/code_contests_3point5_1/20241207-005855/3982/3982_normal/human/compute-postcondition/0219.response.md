According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If there are more elements in the `avail` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is updated to a new value based on the minimum between the previous `psum_min` and the current `psum`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `avail` list must have more elements.
State: **`psum_min` is updated to a new value based on the minimum between the previous `psum_min` and the current `psum`, for the loop to execute another time `avail` must have more elements**
