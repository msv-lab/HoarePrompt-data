Example Answer: 
The values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0, the value of `y` is appended to the `rel_lights_y` list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0, `x` and `y` have been calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`, and if `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, the value of `y` has been appended to `rel_lights_y`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0, `x` and `y` have been calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`, and if `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, the value of `y` has been appended to `rel_lights_y`**
