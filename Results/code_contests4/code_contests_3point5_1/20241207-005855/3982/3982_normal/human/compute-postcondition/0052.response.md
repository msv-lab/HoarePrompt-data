Postcondition: ***`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0. If `x` and `y` are both greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` is updated with new elements and `rel_lights_y` has an additional element `y`. The `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time.***
