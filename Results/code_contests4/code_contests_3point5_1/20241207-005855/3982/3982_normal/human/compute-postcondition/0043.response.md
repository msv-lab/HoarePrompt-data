Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values of `lx - rx` and `ly - ry` respectively. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, derived from the differences between the elements of `lights` and `rx`, `ry`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `robbers` list, `lx` and `ly` are updated based on the next elements in the `lights` list, `x` and `y` are assigned values based on the unknown values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, `ry`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, derived from the differences between the elements of `lights` and `rx`, `ry`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `robbers` list, `lx` and `ly` are updated based on the next elements in the `lights` list, `x` and `y` are assigned values based on the unknown values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, `ry`**
