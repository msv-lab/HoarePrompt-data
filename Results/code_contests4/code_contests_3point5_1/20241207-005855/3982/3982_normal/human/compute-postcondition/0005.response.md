According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `robbers`. If the list `robbers` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are empty lists, they need to be adjusted to have the same number of elements as `robbers` list in order for the loop to execute. At the start of the first iteration, `rx` and `ry` will be the first elements of the `robbers` list.
State: **`rel_lights_x` is a list with the same number of elements as `robbers`, `rel_lights_y` is a list with the same number of elements as `robbers`, for the loop to execute the first time `robbers` is a list with at least one element, `rx` is the first element of `robbers`, `ry` is the first element of `robbers`**
