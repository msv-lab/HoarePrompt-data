According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `avail`. If there are more elements in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value and the current `psum`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list `avail` must have more elements.
State: **`psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value and the current `psum`, for the loop to execute one more time `avail` must have more elements**
