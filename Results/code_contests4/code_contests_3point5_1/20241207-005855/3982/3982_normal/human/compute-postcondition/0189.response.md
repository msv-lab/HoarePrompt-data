Example Answer:
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The value of `ans` is unknown, but `x` can be calculated based on the initial state. Therefore, the maximum value between 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)` is assigned to `sp`, and `ep` will be the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. 
Output State: **`sp` is assigned a value; `ep` is assigned a value**
