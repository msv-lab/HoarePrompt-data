According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans` and the elements in the `avail` list. If `ans` is greater than 0 and the elements in the `avail` list are 0 up to the new `ans` value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is less than 10^6 + 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated value of `l + (r - l) // 2`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ans` must be greater than 0 and all elements in `avail` list up to the new `ans` value must be 0.
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is less than 10^6 + 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated value of `l + (r - l) // 2`, for the loop to execute the third time `ans` is greater than 0, `avail[i]` is 0 where `i` is less than the new `ans` value**
