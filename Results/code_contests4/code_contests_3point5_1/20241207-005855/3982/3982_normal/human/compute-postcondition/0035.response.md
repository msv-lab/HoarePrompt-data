According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `lights` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights`, all elements are greater than or equal to 0. The values of `x` and `y` have been calculated and appended to `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` respectively. To execute the loop one more time, a new value of `y` needs to be appended to `rel_lights_y`.
State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights`, where all elements are greater than or equal to 0.**
