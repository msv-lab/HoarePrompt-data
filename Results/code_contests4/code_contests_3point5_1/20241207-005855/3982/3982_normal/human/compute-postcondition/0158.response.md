Example Answer:
`psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, which represents positive infinity in this context. The other variables and lists are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list up to the calculated `ans` value have been updated based on the conditions in the loop. The final values of `avail` depend on the values of `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, and `ans` after all iterations of the loop have finished. `psum_min` is assigned positive infinity.**
