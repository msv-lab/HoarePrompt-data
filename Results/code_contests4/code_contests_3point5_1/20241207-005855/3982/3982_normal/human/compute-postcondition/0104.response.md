According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `avail`. If the list `avail` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` being lists ensures that `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `ans` is 500000.5, `psum_min` is assigned an unknown value `INF`, and `psum` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `avail` must have at least one element and `ax` should be the first element of the list `avail`.
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 with certain values at specific indices incremented and decremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is 500000.5, `psum_min` is assigned an unknown value `INF`, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` has at least one element and `ax` is the first element of `avail`**
