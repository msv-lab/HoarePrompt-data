Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the length of the list `rel_lights_x`. The value of `n` will be the number of elements in the list `rel_lights_x`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, derived from the differences between the elements of `lights` and `rx`, `ry`. All valid `x` and `y` values where `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0 have been appended to `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`, respectively, for all combinations of `robbers` and `lights`. `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, derived from the differences between the elements of `lights` and `rx`, `ry`.
