Example Answer:
`psum_min` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `psum`, which is the value of `ax`. The value of `psum` is not provided, but `psum_min` is assigned an unknown value `INF`. Therefore, after this operation, `psum_min` will be updated to be the minimum between `psum_min` and the value of `ax`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 with certain values at specific indices incremented and decremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is 500000.5, `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `ax`, `psum` is the value of `ax`, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` has at least one element and `ax` is the first element of `avail`**
