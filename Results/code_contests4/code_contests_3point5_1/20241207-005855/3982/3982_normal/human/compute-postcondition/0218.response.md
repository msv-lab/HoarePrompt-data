Example Answer:
The value of `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `psum_min` and the value of `psum`. The initial state indicates that `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, so the new value of `psum_min` will be the minimum between `INF` and the current value of `psum`. Since the value of `psum` is updated based on the value of `ax`, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`, the final value of `psum_min` will depend on the specific values of `psum`, `ax`, and `avail`.

Output State: **`psum_min` is updated to a new value based on the minimum between the previous `psum_min` and the current `psum`**
