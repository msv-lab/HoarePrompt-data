According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` can be either 0 or 500001.5 and `r` can be either 500000.5 or 10^6 + 1. To guarantee the loop executes one more time, `l` needs to be less than `r`, which means `l` should be less than 10^6 + 1 and `r` should be greater than 0. Hence, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is less than 10^6 + 1, `r` is greater than 0**
