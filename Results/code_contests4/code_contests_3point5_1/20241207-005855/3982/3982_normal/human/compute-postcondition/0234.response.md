Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calculates certain values based on the relationships between the input parameters n, m, a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i. It then iterates through combinations of robbers and lights to derive `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` lists. After that, it performs a series of computations using the values from the lists and predefined constraints. The function ultimately prints the final value of `l`.**
