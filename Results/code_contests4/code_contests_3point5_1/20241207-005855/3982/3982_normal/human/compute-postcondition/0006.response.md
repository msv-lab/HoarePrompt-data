According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If the list has at least 1 pair of coordinates, the loop will execute. 

To adjust the state before the loop starts:
- `rel_lights_x` should have the same number of elements as the `lights` list
- `rel_lights_y` should have the same number of elements as the `lights` list
- `robbers` should be a list with at least one element
- `rx` should be the first element of the `robbers` list
- `ry` should be the first element of the `robbers` list

State: **`rel_lights_x` is a list with the same number of elements as `lights`, `rel_lights_y` is a list with the same number of elements as `lights`, for the loop to execute the first time `robbers` is a list with at least one element, `rx` is the first element of `robbers`, `ry` is the first element of `robbers`**
