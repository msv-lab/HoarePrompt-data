According to the code, the loop will execute `ans + 1` times. In this case, `ans` is 500000.5, so the loop will execute 500001 times. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 filled with zeros, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ans` is 500000.5**
