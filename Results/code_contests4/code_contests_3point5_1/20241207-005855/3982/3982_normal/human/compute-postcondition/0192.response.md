Example Answer:
`avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. The previous values of `sp`, `ep`, and `avail` are known, where `sp` is assigned a value, `ep` is assigned a value, and `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, the state of `avail` will change accordingly. 
Output State: **`sp` is assigned a value, `ep` is assigned a value, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1.**
