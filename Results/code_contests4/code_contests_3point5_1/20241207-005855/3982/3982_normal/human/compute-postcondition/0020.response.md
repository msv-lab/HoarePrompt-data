Example Answer:
The value of `y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`, which means the list `rel_lights_y` now has one more element. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with three more elements than `lights` after the last iteration. Both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with three more elements than `lights` after the last iteration. Both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0**
