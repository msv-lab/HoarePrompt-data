According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list of lights. If there are more lights to iterate over, the loop will execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0, and `x` and `y` are calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`. If `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, `rel_lights_y` has appended the value of `y`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, there should be more lights in the list to iterate over.
State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0. `x` and `y` are calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`. If `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, `rel_lights_y` has appended the value of `y`.**
