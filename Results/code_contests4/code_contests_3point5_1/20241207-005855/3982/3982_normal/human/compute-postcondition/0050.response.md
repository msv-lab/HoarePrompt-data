Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the `rel_lights_x` list. The elements of `rel_lights_x` are now updated based on the appended `x` value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` is a list with updated elements, `rel_lights_y` is a list with elements greater than or equal to 0, `x` and `y` are calculated based on the elements of the lists, and the `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` is a list with updated elements, `rel_lights_y` is a list with elements greater than or equal to 0, `x` and `y` are calculated based on the elements of the lists, and the `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time**
