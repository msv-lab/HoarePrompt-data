Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `l + (r - l) // 2`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is 10^6 + 1, `ans` will be `0 + (10^6 + 1 - 0) // 2` which simplifies to `10^6 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 = 500000 + 0 + 0.5 = 500000.5`. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 filled with zeros, `ans` is 500000.5.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 filled with zeros, `ans` is 500000.5**
