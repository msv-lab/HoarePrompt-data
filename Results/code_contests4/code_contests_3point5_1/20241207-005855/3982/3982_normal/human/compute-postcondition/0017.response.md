According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If there are more elements in the `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` lists compared to the `lights` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights`, and both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` lists must have one more element than the `lights` list.
State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with two more elements than `lights` after the last iteration. Both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0**
