Example Answer:
The value of `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `sp` and `ep` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `sp` is assigned a value, `ep` is assigned a value, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`sp` is assigned a value, `ep` is assigned a value, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1**
