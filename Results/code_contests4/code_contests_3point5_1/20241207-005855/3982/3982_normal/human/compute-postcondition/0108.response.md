Example Answer: 
The value of `ax` is added to `psum`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` still has elements left, `ans` is 500000.5, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is the value of `ax` added, for the loop to execute again `ax` is the next element in `avail`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` still has elements left, `ans` is 500000.5, `psum_min` is updated, `psum` is the value of `ax` added, for the loop to execute again `ax` is the next element in `avail`**
