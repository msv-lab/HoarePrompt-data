Example Answer:
`y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`, where `y` is a non-negative value. The length of `rel_lights_y` increases by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights`, where all elements are greater than or equal to 0 and `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`, `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights`, where all elements are greater than or equal to 0 and `x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`, `y` is appended to `rel_lights_y`**
