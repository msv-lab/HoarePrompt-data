Example Answer:
The `psum_min` value is updated to be the minimum of the current `psum_min` value and the `psum` value. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the `avail` list up to the updated `ans` value have been modified, `ax` is set to the next element in the `avail` list, and the updated `psum_min` and `psum` values are determined, `psum` is incremented by the unknown value of `ax`, `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of the current `psum_min` and `psum`.
Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list up to the updated `ans` value have been modified, `ax` is set to the next element in the `avail` list, and the updated `psum_min` and `psum` values are determined, `psum` is incremented by the unknown value of `ax`, `psum_min` is updated to the minimum of the current `psum_min` and `psum`**
