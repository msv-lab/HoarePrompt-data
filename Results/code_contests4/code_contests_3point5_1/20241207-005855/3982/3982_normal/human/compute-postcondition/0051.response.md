Example Answer:
`y` is appended to the `rel_lights_y` list. The elements of `rel_lights_y` are already greater than or equal to 0, and `y` is calculated based on the elements of the lists. The `rel_lights_x` list is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` is a list with updated elements, `rel_lights_y` is a list with elements greater than or equal to 0 and an additional element `y`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` is a list with updated elements, `rel_lights_y` is a list with elements greater than or equal to 0 and an additional element `y`**
