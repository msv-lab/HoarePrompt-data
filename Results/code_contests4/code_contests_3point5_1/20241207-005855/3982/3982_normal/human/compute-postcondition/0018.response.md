Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the differences between `lx` and `rx`, and `ly` and `ry` respectively. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not provided, so the output state is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with two more elements than `lights` after the last iteration. Both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with two more elements than `lights` after the last iteration. Both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0**
