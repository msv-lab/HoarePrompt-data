Example Answer:
`x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`, increasing its length by 1. The length of `rel_lights_x` is now one more than the length of `lights`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights` after the last iteration.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights` after the last iteration**
