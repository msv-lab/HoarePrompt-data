Example Answer:
`psum` is assigned the value 0. The values of other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the `avail` list up to the calculated `ans` value have been updated based on the conditions in the loop. The final values of `avail` depend on the values of `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, and `ans` after all iterations of the loop have finished. `psum_min` is assigned positive infinity. `psum` is 0.
