Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values `lx - rx` and `ly - ry` respectively. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights` after the last iteration.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights` after the last iteration**
