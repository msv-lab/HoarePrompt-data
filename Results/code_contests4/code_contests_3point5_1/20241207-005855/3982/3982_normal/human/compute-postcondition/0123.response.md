According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `i`. If `i` is less than `ans`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is less than 10^6 + 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated value of `l + (r - l) // 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans` is at least 0, `avail[i]` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ans` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be less than the new `ans` value.
