Example Answer:
`x` is appended to `rel_lights_x`. The previous states of all variables are retained. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0, `x` and `y` have been calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`, and if `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, the value of `y` has been appended to `rel_lights_y, `x` has been appended to `rel_lights_x`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0, `x` and `y` have been calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`, and if `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, the value of `y` has been appended to `rel_lights_y, `x` has been appended to `rel_lights_x`**
