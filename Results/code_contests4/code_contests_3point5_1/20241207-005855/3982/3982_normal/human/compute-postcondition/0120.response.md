Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `l + (r - l) // 2`, where `l` is less than 10^6 + 1 and `r` is greater than 0. The calculation involves simple arithmetic operations, so `ans` will be the result of adding `l` to half the difference between `r` and `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is less than 10^6 + 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated value of `l + (r - l) // 2`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is less than 10^6 + 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated value of `l + (r - l) // 2`**
