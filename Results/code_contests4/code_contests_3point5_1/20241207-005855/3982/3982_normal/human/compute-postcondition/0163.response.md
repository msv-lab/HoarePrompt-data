According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `avail` list. If there are more elements to iterate through, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, all elements of the `avail` list up to the calculated `ans` value have been updated. The final values of `avail` depend on `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, and `ans`. `psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between positive infinity and the sum of all elements in the `avail` list, and `psum` is the sum of all elements in the `avail` list.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `ax` should be set to the next element in the `avail` list after the last iteration. Additionally, the `ans` value should be incremented or updated based on the loop conditions.

State: **All elements of the `avail` list up to the updated `ans` value have been modified, `ax` is set to the next element in the `avail` list, and the updated `psum_min` and `psum` values are determined**.
