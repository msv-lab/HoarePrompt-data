According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `lights`. If there are more elements in the `lights` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights`. If `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`, the list `rel_lights_x` has an additional element `x` at the end, and `rel_lights_y` has `y` appended to it. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `lights` list must have at least one more element, and the new element should be considered for `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`.
State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights` after the last iteration.**
