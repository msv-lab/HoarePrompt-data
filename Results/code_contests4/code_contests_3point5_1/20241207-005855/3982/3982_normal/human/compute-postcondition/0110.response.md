According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `avail`. If there are still elements left in `avail`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` still has elements left. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `avail` becomes the value of `ax`.
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` still has elements left, `ans` is 500000.5, `psum_min` is updated with the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`, `psum` is the value of `ax` added, for the loop to execute again `ax` is the next element in `avail`**
