Postcondition: ***All elements of the `avail` list are modified to 0. `psum_min` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the sum of all elements in the `avail` list. `psum` is the sum of all elements in the `avail` list. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. `l` is less than or equal to `r`. `ans` is calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`. `ans` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute, `n` is greater than 0. `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`. `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. If `x + y >= ans`, `sp` is assigned a value, `ep` is assigned a value, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, the function updates the availability of resources accordingly.***
