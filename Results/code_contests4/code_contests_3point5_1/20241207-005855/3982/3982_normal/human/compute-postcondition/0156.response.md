Postcondition: ***Output State: All elements of the `avail` list up to the calculated `ans` value are set to 0. `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is updated to the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is updated to the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list. `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1.***
