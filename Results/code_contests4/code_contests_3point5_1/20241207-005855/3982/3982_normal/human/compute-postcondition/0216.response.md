According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `avail`. If `avail` is a non-empty iterable, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF` and `psum` is 0. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `avail` must be a non-empty iterable and `ax` should be the first element in `avail`.
State: **`psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `avail` is a non-empty iterable, `ax` is the first element in `avail`**.
