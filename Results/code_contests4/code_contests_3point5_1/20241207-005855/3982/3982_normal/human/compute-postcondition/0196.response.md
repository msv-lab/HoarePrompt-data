Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, where `rel_lights_x` is a list. The value of `i` determines which element from `rel_lights_x` will be assigned to `x`. The states of other variables are not affected in this step.
Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list are modified to 0, `psum_min`, `psum`, `r`, `l`, `ans`, `y`, `sp`, `ep` are updated based on the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 0, and the conditions related to `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep`, and the elements in the `avail` list must be met, `x` is updated to the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`.**
