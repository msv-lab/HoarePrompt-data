Example Answer:
The variables `l` and `r` are assigned the values 0 and 10^6 + 1, respectively. The previous values of all other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1**
