Example Answer:
The value of `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the output state is: `psum_min` is the minimum value of the cumulative sum `psum` after iterating through all elements in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in the `avail` list and it is not equal to 0; `l` is `ans + 1`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is the minimum value of the cumulative sum `psum` after iterating through all elements in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in the `avail` list and it is not equal to 0; `l` is `ans + 1`**
