Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, where `i` has been incremented by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the `avail` list are modified with an increment of 1 at index `sp` and a decrement of 1 at index `ep + 1`. `psum_min`, `psum`, `r`, `l`, `ans`, `n` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and now `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`.
Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list are modified with an increment of 1 at index `sp` and a decrement of 1 at index `ep + 1`. `psum_min`, `psum`, `r`, `l`, `ans`, `n` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]**
