Example Answer:
`psum` is updated by adding the value of `ax`. The loop will execute another time only if `avail` has more elements. The values of `psum_min`, `avail`, and `ax` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is updated to a new value based on the minimum between the previous `psum_min` and the current `psum`. The loop will execute another time only if `avail` has more elements.
Output State: **`psum_min` is updated to a new value based on the minimum between the previous `psum_min` and the current `psum`. The loop will execute another time only if `avail` has more elements**
