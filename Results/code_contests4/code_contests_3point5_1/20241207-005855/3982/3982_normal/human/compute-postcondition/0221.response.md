Example Answer:
`psum_min` is updated to a new value based on the minimum between the previous `psum_min` and the current `psum`. The loop will execute another time only if `avail` has more elements. After executing the code, the value of `psum_min` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value and the current `psum`.**
