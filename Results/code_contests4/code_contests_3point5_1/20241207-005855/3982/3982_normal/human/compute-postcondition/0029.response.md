Postcondition: ***`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0. `x` and `y` are calculated based on the differences between `lx` and `rx`, `ly` and `ry`. If `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, `rel_lights_y` has appended the value of `y`.***
