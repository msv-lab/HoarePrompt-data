Example Answer:
`y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`. The previous values of `rel_lights_y` are not provided, so the output state is: `rel_lights_x` contains the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` contains the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`**
