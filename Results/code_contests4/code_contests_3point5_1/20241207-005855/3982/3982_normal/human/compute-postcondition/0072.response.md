According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, and `n` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` need to be lists with elements greater than or equal to 0 and `n` should reflect the length of `rel_lights_x`. 
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 filled with zeros, `ans` is 500000.5, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
