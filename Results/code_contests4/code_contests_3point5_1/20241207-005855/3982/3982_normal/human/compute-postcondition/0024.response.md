According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` must have the same number of elements as `lights`, and all elements in both lists must be greater than or equal to 0. Also, for the loop to execute one more time, there should still be elements in the `robbers` list.
State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights` where all elements are greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time there are still elements in the `robbers` list**
