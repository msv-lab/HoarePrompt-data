According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` was either equal to `ans` or `ans + 1`, and `r` was greater than `l`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be less than `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All elements of the `avail` list will be modified. `psum_min` will be the minimum value between positive infinity and the sum of all elements in the `avail` list. `psum` will be the sum of all elements in the `avail` list. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be less than `r`.**
