Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 with the value at index `sp` incremented by 2 and decreased by 2 at index `ep + 1`, `ans` is 500000.5, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 2, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `ep` is less than `ans`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep = min(ans, x)`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 2, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 3, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is updated based on the calculation `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.**
