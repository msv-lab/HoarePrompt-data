According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of `robbers`. If there are more elements in the `robbers` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, derived from the differences between the elements of `lights` and `rx`, `ry`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `robbers` list.
