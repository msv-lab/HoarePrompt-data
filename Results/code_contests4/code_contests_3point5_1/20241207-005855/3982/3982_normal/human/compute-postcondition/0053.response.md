According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `lights`. If the list has more elements, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0. If `x` and `y` are both greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` is updated with new elements and `rel_lights_y` has an additional element `y`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `lights` list must have more elements.
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, if `x` and `y` are both greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` is updated with new elements and `rel_lights_y` has an additional element `y`, `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time**
