Example Answer:
The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are subtracted from each other and assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are elements of `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` lists. Therefore, `x` and `y` will be calculated based on the elements of the lists. The states of the other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `x` and `y` are calculated based on the elements of the lists, the `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time**
