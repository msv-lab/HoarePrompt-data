Example Answer:
`rel_lights_y` is appended with the value of `y`. The length of `rel_lights_y` becomes one more than the length of `lights` after the last iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights` after the last iteration.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights` after the last iteration**
