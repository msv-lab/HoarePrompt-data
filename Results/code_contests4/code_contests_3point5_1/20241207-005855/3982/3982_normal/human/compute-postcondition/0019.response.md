Example Answer:
`rel_lights_x` is appended with the value of `x`, increasing the size of the list by one. The variable `x` is added to `rel_lights_x`. The variables `rel_lights_y` and `lights` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with three more elements than `lights` after the last iteration. Both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with three more elements than `lights` after the last iteration. Both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0**
