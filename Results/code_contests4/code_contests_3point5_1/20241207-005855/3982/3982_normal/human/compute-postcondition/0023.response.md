According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `robbers` list. If there are still elements in the `robbers` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights`, and all elements in both lists are greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must still be elements left in the `robbers` list.
State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with the same number of elements as `lights`. All elements in `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time there are still elements in the `robbers` list**
