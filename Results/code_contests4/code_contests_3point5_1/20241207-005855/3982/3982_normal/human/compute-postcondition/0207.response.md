Output State: All elements of the `avail` list are modified with an increment of 1 at index `sp` and a decrement of 1 at index `ep + 1`. `psum_min`, `psum`, `r`, `l`, `ans`, `n`, `i` are all incremented by 1. `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]` and `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`. `sp` is calculated as `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`.
