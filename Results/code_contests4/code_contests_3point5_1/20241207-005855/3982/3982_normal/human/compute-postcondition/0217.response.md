Example Answer: 
`psum` is increased by the value of `ax`, and `ax` is the first element in `avail`, which is a non-empty iterable. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `psum` depends on the value of `ax` and the initial value of `psum`. The output state is: `psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, `psum` is updated based on the value of `ax`, `avail` is a non-empty iterable, `ax` is the first element in `avail`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is assigned the value `INF`, `psum` is updated based on the value of `ax`, `avail` is a non-empty iterable, `ax` is the first element in `avail`**
