Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `lx - rx` and `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not given, so the values of `x` and `y` cannot be determined. However, if `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are both greater than or equal to 0, then `rel_lights_x` is updated with new elements and `rel_lights_y` has an additional element `y`. Also, the `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` may be updated with new elements, `rel_lights_y` may have an additional element `y`, and `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` may be updated with new elements, `rel_lights_y` may have an additional element `y`, and `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time**
