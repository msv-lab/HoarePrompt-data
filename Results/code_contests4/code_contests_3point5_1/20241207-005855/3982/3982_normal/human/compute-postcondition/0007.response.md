Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values `lx - rx` and `ly - ry` respectively. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not specified in the initial state, but it is mentioned that `rx` is the first element of `robbers` and `ry` is the first element of `robbers`. Therefore, `x` and `y` will be calculated based on the values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` at the specific moment of execution.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` is a list with the same number of elements as `lights`, `rel_lights_y` is a list with the same number of elements as `lights`, for the loop to execute the first time `robbers` is a list with at least one element, `rx` is the first element of `robbers`, `ry` is the first element of `robbers`, `x` and `y` are calculated based on the values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` at the specific moment of execution.**
