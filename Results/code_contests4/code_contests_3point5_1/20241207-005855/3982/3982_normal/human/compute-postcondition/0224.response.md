Example Answer:
`psum_min` is updated by taking the minimum value between the previous `psum_min` and the current `psum`, and `psum` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value and the current `psum`.
Output State: **`psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value and the current `psum`**
