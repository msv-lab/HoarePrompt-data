According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ans`. If ans is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the variables `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` being lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` being the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` being less than 10^6 + 1, `r` being greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute. 
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is less than 10^6 + 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated value of `l + (r - l) // 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans` is at least 0**
