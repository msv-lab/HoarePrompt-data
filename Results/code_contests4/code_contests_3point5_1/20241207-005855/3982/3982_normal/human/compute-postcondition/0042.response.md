According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `lights` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `lights` list. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, derived from the differences between the elements of `lights` and `rx`, `ry`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `robbers` list, and the current values of `lx` and `ly` should be updated based on the next elements in the `lights` list.
