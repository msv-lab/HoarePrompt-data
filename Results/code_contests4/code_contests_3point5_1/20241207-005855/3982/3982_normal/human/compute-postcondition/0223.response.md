Example Answer:
`psum` is updated by adding `ax` to its current value. The value of `psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between its previous value and the current `psum`. For the loop to execute one more time, `avail` must have more elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value and the current `psum`, `psum` is updated by adding `ax` to its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time `avail` must have more elements.
Output State: **`psum_min` is updated based on the minimum between the previous value and the current `psum`, `psum` is updated by adding `ax` to its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time `avail` must have more elements**
