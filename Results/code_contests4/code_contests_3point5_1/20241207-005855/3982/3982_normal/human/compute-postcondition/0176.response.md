Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list will be modified. `psum_min` will be the minimum value between positive infinity and the sum of all elements in the `avail` list. `psum` will be the sum of all elements in the `avail` list. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be less than `r`. `ans` is calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`.**
