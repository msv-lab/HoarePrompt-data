Postcondition: ***All elements of the `avail` list are modified with an increment of 1 at the index `sp` and a decrement of 1 at the index `ep + 1`. `psum_min`, `psum`, `r`, `l`, `ans`, and `n` remain the same. If `ep` is less than `ans`, the described modifications to the `avail` list are executed.***
