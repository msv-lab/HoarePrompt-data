Output State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is equal to the final value before l < r condition is false, `r` is equal to the final value before l < r condition is false, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 with certain values at specific indices incremented and decremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is the final value before l < r condition is false, `psum_min` contains the minimum value of all elements in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, the minimum value of all elements in `avail` is 0. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, the minimum value of all elements in `avail` is not 0.**
