Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the differences between `lx` and `rx`, and `ly` and `ry` respectively. The calculation is straightforward based on the given initial state. 
Output State: **`rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` are lists with one more element than `lights`, where all elements are greater than or equal to 0; `x`, `y` are the differences between `lx` and `rx`, and `ly` and `ry` respectively.**
