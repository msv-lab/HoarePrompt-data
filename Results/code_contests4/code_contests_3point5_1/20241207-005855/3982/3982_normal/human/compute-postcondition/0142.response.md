Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list up to the calculated `ans` value are set to 0. `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is assigned the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list. After entering the if condition (x + y >= ans) holds true, `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and (x - (x + y - ans)) + 1**.
