Example Answer: 
`y` is appended to the `rel_lights_y` list. The `rel_lights_y` list may have additional elements now, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rel_lights_x` may be updated with new elements, `rel_lights_y` may have an additional element `y`, and `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`rel_lights_x` may be updated with new elements, `rel_lights_y` may have an additional element `y`, and `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time**
