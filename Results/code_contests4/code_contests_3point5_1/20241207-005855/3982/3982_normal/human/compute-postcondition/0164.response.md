Example Answer: 
`psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. The previous values of `psum` and `ax` are unknown, so the output state is: All elements of the `avail` list up to the updated `ans` value have been modified, `ax` is set to the next element in the `avail` list, and the updated `psum_min` and `psum` values are determined, `psum` is incremented by the unknown value of `ax`.
Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list up to the updated `ans` value have been modified, `ax` is set to the next element in the `avail` list, and the updated `psum_min` and `psum` values are determined, `psum` is incremented by the unknown value of `ax`**
