According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is less than `r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is 10^6 + 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `r` needs to be greater than `l`. So the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `r` needs to be greater than `l`
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements that are greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 filled with zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `r` needs to be greater than `l`**
