Example Answer:
The `psum_min` variable is assigned the minimum value between the current `psum_min` value and the sum `psum`. The previous values of `psum_min` and `psum` are unknown, so the output state is: All elements of the `avail` list up to the updated `ans` value have been modified, `ax` is set to the next element in the `avail` list, and the updated `psum_min` and `psum` values are determined. `psum` is updated with the value of `psum + ax`, `psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between the current `psum_min` value and the sum `psum`.
Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list up to the updated `ans` value have been modified, `ax` is set to the next element in the `avail` list, and the updated `psum_min` and `psum` values are determined. `psum` is updated with the value of `psum + ax`, `psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between the current `psum_min` value and the sum `psum`**
