Output State: **All elements of the `avail` list are modified to 0, `psum_min` is the minimum value between positive infinity and the sum of all elements in the `avail` list, `psum` is the sum of all elements in the `avail` list, if `psum_min` is equal to 0 then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`, if `psum_min` is not equal to 0 then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `ans` is calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`, `ans` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`.**
