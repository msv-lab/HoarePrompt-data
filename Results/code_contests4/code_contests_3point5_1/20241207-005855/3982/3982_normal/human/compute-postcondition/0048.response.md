According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lights` list. If there are more elements in the `lights` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `lights` list.
State: **`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, the `lights` list must have more elements for the loop to execute another time**
