Postcondition: ***`rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` are lists with elements greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `l` is 0, `r` is 10^6 + 1, `avail` is a list of length 10^6 + 2 with certain values at specific indices incremented and decremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is 500000.5, `psum_min` contains the minimum value of all elements in `avail`, `psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`. The minimum value of all elements in `avail` is not equal to 0.***
