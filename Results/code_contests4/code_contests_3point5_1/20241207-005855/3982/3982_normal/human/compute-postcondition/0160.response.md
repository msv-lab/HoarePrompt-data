According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `avail` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. At the end of the loop, the final values of `avail` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop. So, for the loop to execute, the avail list must have at least one element, and `ax` will take on each element of the `avail` list during each iteration.

State: **All elements of the `avail` list up to the calculated `ans` value have been updated based on the conditions in the loop. The final values of `avail` depend on the values of `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y`, and `ans` after all iterations of the loop have finished. `psum_min` is assigned positive infinity. `psum` is 0. For the loop to execute, `avail` list has at least one element, and `ax` will take on each element of the `avail` list during each iteration.**
