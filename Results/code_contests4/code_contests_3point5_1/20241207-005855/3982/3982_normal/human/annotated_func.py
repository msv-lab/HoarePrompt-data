#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calculates certain values based on the relationships between the input parameters n, m, a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i. It then iterates through combinations of robbers and lights to derive `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` lists. After that, it performs a series of computations using the values from the lists and predefined constraints. The function ultimately prints the final value of `l`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. The coordinates a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i ≤ 10^6.**

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of integers. The function does not handle any edge cases or check for invalid inputs. It simply converts the input string to a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. Coordinates a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i ≤ 10^6 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ i ≤ m.**

    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is the result of adding the integer value of each element in the input split by space to the variable 'o'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `o`, which is a string. It then splits the input by space, converts each element to an integer, adds it to the integer value of `o`, and returns a list of integers. The code does not consider potential errors that may occur during the conversion or addition process.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where both are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. The function returns a list of size 'n' where each element is the result of calling function `func_2()`.

def func_5(f):

    #The program returns a list of values obtained by calling the function func_5 with arguments from the second element onwards of 'dim' for 'dim[0]' number of times, or returns the result of calling function 'f' if 'dim' is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 accepts a parameter `f` and returns a list of values obtained by calling the function `func_5` with arguments from the second element onwards of 'dim' for 'dim[0]' number of times if 'dim' is not empty. If 'dim' is empty, it returns the result of calling function 'f'. The annotations suggest a recursive behavior that is not present in the code, as the code simply calls `f()` if 'dim' is empty, potentially missing the recursive aspect indicated in the annotations.
