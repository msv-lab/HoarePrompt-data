Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes in four integers, sorts them, and then calculates the values of a, b, and c based on the sorted numbers. It then prints the values of a, b, and c in the required format. The program works correctly for all potential cases as it correctly identifies a, b, and c by subtracting the sorted numbers. The output is in the correct format as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all cases.
