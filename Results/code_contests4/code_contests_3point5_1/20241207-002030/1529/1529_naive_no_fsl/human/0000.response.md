Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input numbers, sorts them in ascending order, and then calculates the three guessed integers a, b, and c by subtracting the minimum number from the maximum number, the second minimum from the maximum number, and the third minimum from the maximum number respectively. This logic covers all possible cases and the program provides the correct output as per the problem description for all inputs.
