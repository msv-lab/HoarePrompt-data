Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads four positive integers from the input, sorts them in ascending order, and then calculates the differences between the maximum and minimum, second maximum and minimum, and third maximum and minimum values in the sorted list. This logic correctly matches the problem description. Additionally, the code does not have any logical errors and covers all possible cases where the input numbers represent the sums of a, b, c, and a+b+c. Therefore, we can confidently say that the code is correct.
