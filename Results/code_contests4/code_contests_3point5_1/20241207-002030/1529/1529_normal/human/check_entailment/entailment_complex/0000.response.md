Correctness: **True**

The program reads four positive integers, sorts them, and then calculates the differences between the maximum and minimum values, second maximum and minimum values, and third maximum and minimum values in the sorted list. This approach correctly identifies the original three positive integers a, b, and c that were used to calculate the four numbers on the board. The program output matches the expected output as per the problem description for all potential cases.
