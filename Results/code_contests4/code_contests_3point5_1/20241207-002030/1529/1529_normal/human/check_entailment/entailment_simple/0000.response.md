Correctness: **True**

The program takes four positive integers as input, sorts them, and then prints three integers by subtracting the minimum from the maximum, the second minimum from the maximum, and the third minimum from the maximum. This approach is correct as it guarantees that the numbers printed are a, b, and c such that a+b, a+c, b+c, and a+b+c are the four numbers written on the board. This will always work for any valid input as the maximum value must correspond to a+b+c, and the other three values will be the pairwise sums. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
