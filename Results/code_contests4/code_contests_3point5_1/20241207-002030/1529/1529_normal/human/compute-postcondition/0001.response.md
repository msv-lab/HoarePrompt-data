Example Answer:
The list `numbers` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the list are unknown, so the output state is: x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9; numbers is a list containing the sorted integers.
Output State: **x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9; numbers is a list containing the sorted integers**
