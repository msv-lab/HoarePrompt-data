Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the differences between the maximum value in the list `numbers` and the other elements in the list. As the list is sorted, `numbers[3]` represents the maximum value, and `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, and `numbers[2]` represent the smaller values. Therefore, the differences calculated are `numbers[3] - numbers[0]`, `numbers[3] - numbers[1]`, and `numbers[3] - numbers[2]`. The values of `numbers` are not altered during this process. 
Output State: **x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9; numbers is a list containing the sorted integers**
