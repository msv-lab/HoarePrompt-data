The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. The parameters `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. The function has multiple return cases:

Case 1: The function returns the value of `x`.

Case 2: The function returns the sum of `y` and a non-negative integer `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Case 3: The function returns the value of 3n - x, where `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Case 4: The function returns the value of 3n - y, where `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and return different values based on the specified cases.
