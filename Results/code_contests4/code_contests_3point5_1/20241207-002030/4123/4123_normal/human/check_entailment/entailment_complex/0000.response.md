Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The logic in the program is not consistent with the problem requirements. The function `func_1` returns different values based on the conditions of `x` and `y`, which do not correspond to the calculation of the shortest distance between two points on a square.

Specifically, the return statements in the program do not calculate the distance between the two points on the square as required by the problem description. Instead, the function returns different calculations based on the values of `x` and `y`, which do not relate to finding the shortest path between the two points on the square.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
