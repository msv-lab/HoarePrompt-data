Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` in the code does not return the correct value based on the given problem description. The different cases mentioned in the description are not handled correctly in the code. 

For example, if we consider the case where `y` is 0 and `x` is not equal to `n`, the code does not return the correct value as per the problem description. 

Thus, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
