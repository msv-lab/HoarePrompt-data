Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a square as described in the problem. The program's logic is not consistent with the problem description. The program returns fixed values based on the positions of the points, which does not accurately represent the shortest distance between the points on the square. The program should calculate the shortest path considering the square sides, but it does not do so in all cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
