Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the shortest distance between two points on a square as described in the problem statement. The logic inside the `func_1` function is not handling all the cases correctly. 

For example, if we take the input:
```
Input
2 0 0 1 0
```
The expected output should be 1, but the program will output 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the correctness should be False.
