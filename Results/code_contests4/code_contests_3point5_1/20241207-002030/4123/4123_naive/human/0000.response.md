Correctness: **False**

The program does not provide the correct output for all potential cases. For example, when the input is "2 0 0 1 0", the expected output is 1, but the program gives an output of 6. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly calculate the shortest distance between the points for all scenarios.
