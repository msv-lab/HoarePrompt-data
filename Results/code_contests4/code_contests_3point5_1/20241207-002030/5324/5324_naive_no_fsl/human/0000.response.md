Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk to buy both cakes. The program first reads the input, sorts the tiers based on their sizes, calculates the distance for Sasha and Dima separately, and then prints the total distance. The logic of the program is correct and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
