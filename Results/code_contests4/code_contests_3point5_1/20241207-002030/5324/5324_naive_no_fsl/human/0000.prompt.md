You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sasha and Dima want to buy two n-tier cakes. Each cake should consist of n different tiers: from the size of 1 to the size of n. Tiers should go in order from the smallest to the biggest (from top to bottom).

They live on the same street, there are 2 ⋅ n houses in a row from left to right. Each house has a pastry shop where you can buy a cake tier. Unfortunately, in each pastry shop you can buy only one tier of only one specific size: in the i-th house you can buy a tier of the size a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).

Since the guys carry already purchased tiers, and it is impossible to insert a new tier in the middle of the cake, they agreed to buy tiers from the smallest to the biggest. That is, each of them buys tiers in order: 1, then 2, then 3 and so on up to n.

Initially, Sasha and Dima are located near the first (leftmost) house. Output the minimum distance that they will have to walk in total to buy both cakes. The distance between any two neighboring houses is exactly 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer number n — the number of tiers in each cake (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains 2 ⋅ n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where a_i is equal to the size of the tier, which can be bought in the i-th house. Remember that in each house you can buy only one tier. It is guaranteed that every number from 1 to n occurs in a exactly two times.

Output

Print one number — the minimum distance that the guys have to walk in total to buy both cakes. Guys can be near same house at the same time. They begin near the first (leftmost) house. Each of the guys should buy n tiers in ascending order of their sizes.

Examples

Input

1 1 2 2 3 3

4
4 1 3 2 2 3 1 4


Output


17

Note

In the first example, the possible optimal sequence of actions is:

  * Sasha buys a tier of size 1 near the 1-st house (a_1=1); 
  * Dima goes to the house 2; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 1 near the 2-nd house (a_2=1); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 4; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 2 near the 4-th house (a_4=2); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 5; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 3 near the 5-th house (a_5=3); 
  * Dima goes to the house 3; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 2 near the 3-rd house (a_3=2); 
  * Dima goes to the house 6; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 3 near the 6-th house (a_6=3). 



So, Sasha goes the distance 3+1=4, and Dima goes the distance 1+1+3=5. In total, they cover a distance of 4+5=9. You can make sure that with any other sequence of actions they will walk no less distance.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
