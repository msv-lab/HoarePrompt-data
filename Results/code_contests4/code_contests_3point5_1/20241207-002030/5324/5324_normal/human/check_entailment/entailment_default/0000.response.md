Initial Assesment:
The code seems to correctly solve the problem description by calculating the minimum distance Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy both cakes. It reads the input, sorts the tiers based on their size and position, then calculates the distance covered by Sasha and Dima to buy the tiers in ascending order of their sizes. The logic appears to be sound and there are no obvious issues with the implementation.

Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints provide a clear description of what the code is expected to do. It mentions that the function calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive positions of the elements in the list, which aligns with the problem description. The hints also mention that each of the guys should buy n tiers in ascending order of their sizes, which is exactly what the code is doing.

Final Assessment:
Based on the initial assessment and output hints analysis, it seems that the code is correctly solving the given problem and follows the problem description for every potential case. The code accounts for the minimum distance Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy both cakes in the specified order. Additionally, all provided examples work correctly and there are no edge cases mentioned where the code fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
