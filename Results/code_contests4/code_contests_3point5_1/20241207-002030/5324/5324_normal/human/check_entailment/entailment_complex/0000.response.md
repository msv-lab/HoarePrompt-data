Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided consists of two functions that work together to solve the given problem. 

- Function 1 (`func_1`): This function calculates the greatest common divisor of two input parameters `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. It iteratively updates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, where `x` then holds the greatest common divisor. Since the problem description does not involve calculating the greatest common divisor, this function is not directly related to the problem at hand. Hence, it does not affect the correctness of the overall solution.

- Function 2 (`func_2`): This function reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers where each value from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk in total to buy both cakes. The function sorts the input list based on the tier sizes and their corresponding house numbers. It then calculates the sum of absolute differences between the positions of the tiers in the sorted list to determine the total distance traveled by Sasha and Dima. The function correctly follows the problem description by considering the ordering of the tiers and the corresponding houses in the calculation of the total distance.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and its alignment with the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed true.
