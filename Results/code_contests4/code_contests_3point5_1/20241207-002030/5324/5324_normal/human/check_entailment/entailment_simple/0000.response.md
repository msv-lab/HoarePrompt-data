Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions. The first function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is not directly related to the problem description but is a correct implementation of the algorithm.

The second function `func_2` correctly solves the given problem. It takes input, sorts the tiers based on their sizes and positions, calculates the total distance that Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy the tiers in ascending order, and finally prints the total distance. The program iterates over the sorted list of tiers twice, once for Sasha and once for Dima, calculating the absolute differences between positions and adding them to the total distance. The final total distance is correctly calculated and printed.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk to buy both cakes following the specified rules.
