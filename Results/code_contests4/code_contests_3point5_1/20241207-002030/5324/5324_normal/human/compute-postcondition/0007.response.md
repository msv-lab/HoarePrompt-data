Example Answer: 
`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, which means `prev` now holds the value of `pos`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of `n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`.
Output State: **The values of `n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`**
