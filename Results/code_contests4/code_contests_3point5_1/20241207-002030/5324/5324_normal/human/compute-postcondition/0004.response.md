According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the list 'a' contains 2n integers sorted in ascending order, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. The variables `dist` and `prev` are not directly involved in the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0**
