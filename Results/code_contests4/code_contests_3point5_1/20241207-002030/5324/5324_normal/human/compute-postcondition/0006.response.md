Example Answer:
The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. The initial state mentions that `n` is greater than 0 and the values of `a` and `i` are unknown. Since `pos` is the value at index 1 of the sublist at index `2 * i` in list `a`, we can infer that `pos`, `prev`, and `dist` will be affected by this calculation. However, without knowing the specific values of `a`, `i`, `pos`, and `prev`, we cannot calculate the exact result.
Output State: **The values of `n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, where `pos` is the value at index 1 of the sublist at index `2 * i` in list `a`.**
