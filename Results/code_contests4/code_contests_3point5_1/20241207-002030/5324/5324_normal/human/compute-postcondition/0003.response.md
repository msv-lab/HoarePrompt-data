Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, the list 'a' contains 2n integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, dist is 0, prev is 1.
Output State: **n is an input integer, the list 'a' contains 2n integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, dist is 0, prev is 1**
