Example Answer:
The variable `dist` is assigned the value 0. Since the list 'a' is not involved in any operation, its contents remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, the list 'a' contains 2n integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, dist is 0.
Output State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, the list 'a' contains 2n integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, dist is 0**
