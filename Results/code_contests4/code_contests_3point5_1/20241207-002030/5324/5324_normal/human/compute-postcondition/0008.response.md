According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **The values of `n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1**
