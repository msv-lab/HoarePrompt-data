According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged. `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*i` in list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged. `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`**
