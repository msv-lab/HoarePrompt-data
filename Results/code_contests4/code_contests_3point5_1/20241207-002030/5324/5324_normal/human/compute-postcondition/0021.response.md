Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, and `pos` is assigned the second element of the sublist at index `2 * i + 1`. The value of `pos` is dependent on the current loop iteration, and the previous value of `prev` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains at least `2n+1` integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is updated based on the new `a` values, `prev` is updated based on the previous loop iteration, `pos` is assigned the second element of the sublist at index `2 * i + 1`, `dist` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains at least `2n+1` integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is updated based on the new `a` values, `prev` is updated based on the previous loop iteration, `pos` is assigned the second element of the sublist at index `2 * i + 1`, `dist` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`**
