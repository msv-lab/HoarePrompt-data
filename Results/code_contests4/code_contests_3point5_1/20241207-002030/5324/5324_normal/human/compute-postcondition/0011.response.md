Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, which means `prev` now holds the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*i` in list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*i` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*i` in list `a`.**
