Example Answer:
The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. The loop will execute one more time by incrementing `i` by 1. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*i` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*i` in list `a`.**
