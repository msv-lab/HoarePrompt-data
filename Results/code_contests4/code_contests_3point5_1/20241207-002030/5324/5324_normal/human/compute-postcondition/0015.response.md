Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value of `pos`, where the previous value of `pos` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged, `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between the new `pos` and the unknown previous `pos`, and `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged, `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between the new `pos` and the unknown previous `pos`, and `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`**
