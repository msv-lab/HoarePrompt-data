Example Answer:
`dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. The previous values of `dist`, `pos`, and `prev` are unknown. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`. Therefore, after execution, `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between the new `pos` and the unknown previous `pos`. 
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged, `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between the new `pos` and the unknown previous `pos`, and `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`**
