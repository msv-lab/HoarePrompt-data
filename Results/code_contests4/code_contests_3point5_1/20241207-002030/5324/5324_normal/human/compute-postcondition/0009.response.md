Output State: **The values of `n`, `a`, `i` are unchanged. The value of `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*i` in list `a`.**
