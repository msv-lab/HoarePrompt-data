Example Answer:
`pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`. The previous values of `pos`, `n`, `a`, and `i` are unknown, but `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged, `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, and `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `i` remain unchanged, `dist` is incremented by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, and `pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `2*(i+1)` in list `a`**
