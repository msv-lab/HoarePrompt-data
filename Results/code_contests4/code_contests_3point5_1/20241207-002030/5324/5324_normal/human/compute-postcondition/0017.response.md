Example Answer:
`prev` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `prev` is unknown, so after execution, `prev` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `a` contains 2n integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive positions in `a`, `prev` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` contains 2n integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive positions in `a`, `prev` is 1**
