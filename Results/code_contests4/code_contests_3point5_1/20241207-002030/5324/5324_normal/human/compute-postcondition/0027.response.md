Example Answer:
`pos` is assigned the value of the second element of the sublist at index `2 * i + 1` of list `a`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so the exact value of `pos` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains at least `2n+1` integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is updated based on the new `a` values, `prev` is updated to the value of `pos`, `pos` is assigned the second element of the sublist at index `2 * (i+1) + 1`, `dist` is increased by the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev` for the loop to execute one more time.
