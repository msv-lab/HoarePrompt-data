Example Answer:
The value of `pos` is assigned the value at index 1 of the sublist at index `2 * i` in list `a`. The previous value of `n` is greater than 0, but the values of `a` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, value of `a` and `i` are unknown, `pos` is the value at index 1 of the sublist at index `2 * i` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, value of `a` and `i` are unknown, `pos` is the value at index 1 of the sublist at index `2 * i` in list `a`**
