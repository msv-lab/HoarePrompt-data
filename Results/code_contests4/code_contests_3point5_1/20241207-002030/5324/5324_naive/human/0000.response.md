Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk to buy both cakes. It first sorts the tiers based on their size and position, then calculates the distance for Sasha and Dima separately by iterating through the sorted tiers. The program calculates the distance correctly for both Sasha and Dima, ensuring that they buy the tiers in ascending order of their sizes. Finally, it prints the total distance, which is the sum of the distances covered by Sasha and Dima. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
