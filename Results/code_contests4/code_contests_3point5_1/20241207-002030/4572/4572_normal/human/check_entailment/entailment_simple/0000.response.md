Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the given problem description. 

1. The program reads the input as floating-point numbers, while the problem description specifies that the input will be positive integers.
2. The program does not take into account the specific pattern of the polyline described in the problem, and the formula provided in the program does not match the problem requirements.
3. The program does not handle the case where there is no such x that satisfies the condition, as it simply prints -1 without any explanation or check.

Overall, the program does not accurately implement the requirements of the given problem description.
