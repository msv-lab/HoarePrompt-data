Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two positive floating-point numbers `a` and `b` as input.
- If `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and exits the program as per the problem description.
- Otherwise, it calculates (a + b) / (2 * floor((a + b) / (2 * b))) and prints the result.
- The code correctly handles the case where `a` is less than `b` by outputting -1 as expected.
- It also calculates the minimum positive value `x` as described in the problem statement.
- The output format also matches the requirements specified in the problem description.
- Therefore, the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
