Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are reassigned the values of floating-point numbers obtained by splitting the input. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers, the conversion to float may cause loss of precision. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive floating-point numbers.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive floating-point numbers**
