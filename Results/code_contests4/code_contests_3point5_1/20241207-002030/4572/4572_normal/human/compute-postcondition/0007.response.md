Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two positive floating-point numbers `a` and `b` as input. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and exits the program. Otherwise, it calculates (a + b) / (2 * floor((a + b) / (2 * b))) and prints the result. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, it misses importing the `math` module for the floor function, which may lead to a NameError during execution. **
