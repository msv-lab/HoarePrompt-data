Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two positive integers a and b as input, representing the point (a, b) that the polyline passes through. It then calculates the minimum positive value x such that the polyline passes through the given point (a, b) or determines that there is no such x. The program follows the problem description accurately by checking if a < b and outputting -1 if true. It then calculates the minimum x value using the formula provided in the problem description. The program uses Python's map function to convert the input to float values and calculates the result. Since the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and correctly handles the edge case of a < b, the correctness of the program is True.
