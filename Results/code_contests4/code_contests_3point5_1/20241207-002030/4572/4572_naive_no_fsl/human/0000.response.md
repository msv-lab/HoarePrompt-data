Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum positive value of x such that the polyline passes through the point (a, b) as described in the problem statement. 

The program first reads the input values of a and b, and then checks if a is less than b. If a is less than b, it directly prints -1 as there is no possible x that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum x value using the formula (a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b))) and prints the result.

The program uses floating-point arithmetic to ensure precision in the output as required by the problem statement. Overall, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly and provides the expected output for the given inputs.
