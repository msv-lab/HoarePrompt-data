The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`, and generates a list `res` containing elements computed by multiplying the previous element with the current index value. The list `res` has a length equal to `(en - be + 1)` where the first element is 1 and the subsequent elements are calculated based on the multiplication.
