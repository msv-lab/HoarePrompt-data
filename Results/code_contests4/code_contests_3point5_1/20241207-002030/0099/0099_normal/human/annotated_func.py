    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is [1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0] where the number of 0s is equal to `(en - be + 1)` , `be` is 0, `en` is at least 0
    return res
    #The program returns a list `res` with the number of elements equal to `(en - be + 1)` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0s.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`, and generates a list `res` containing elements computed by multiplying the previous element with the current index value. The list `res` has a length equal to `(en - be + 1)` where the first element is 1 and the subsequent elements are calculated based on the multiplication.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. l_i and r_i are positive integers for each i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_2(n, r):

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. l_i and r_i are positive integers for each i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9. n is greater than or equal to r
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the result of dividing the factorial of n by the factorial of n minus r, where n and r are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ r ≤ n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts two positive integers n and r, where n is not less than r. If n is less than r, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the result of dividing the factorial of n by the factorial of n minus r. It is important to note that the code does not handle any error cases such as when n or r exceed the specified constraints.

def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list containing the updated elements based on the calculation, `arr` has elements, `i` is the length of `arr` - 1
    return tem
    #The program returns the list `tem` containing the updated elements based on the calculation
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list. It iterates through the elements of the input list and calculates the cumulative sum of elements up to the current index. It then stores these updated elements in a new list `tem` and returns this new list. The functionality of the function is to generate a new list `tem` containing the cumulative sum of elements from the input list `arr`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n. Each pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) represents the period of time when the i-th lamp is turned on.**
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the value read from standard input using `BytesIO` object and the lambda function registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It redirects the standard output to a `BytesIO` object, registers a lambda function to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit, and returns the value read from standard input using the `BytesIO` object. The functionality is to manage input and output streams using `BytesIO` and `sys.stdout`.
