Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program consists of four functions that work together to solve the given problem description.
2. Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates a list of factorials from `be` to `en` inclusive, which is necessary for calculating combinations later on.
3. Function 2 (`func_2`) calculates the combination of choosing `r` elements from `n` elements using pre-calculated factorials, which is required for determining the number of ways to choose the lamps to turn on simultaneously.
4. Function 3 (`func_3`) calculates a cumulative sum of the input list, which is used in determining the valid combinations of lamps to turn on simultaneously.
5. Function 4 (`func_4`) reads input from standard input and outputs the result using `BytesIO` objects.
6. The program overall follows the problem description by correctly calculating the number of ways to choose the lamps to turn on simultaneously based on the given time intervals.
7. The functions interact correctly to provide the desired output modulo 998 244 353.
8. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
