You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is [1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0] where the number of 0s is equal to `(en - be + 1)` , `be` is 0, `en` is at least 0
    return res
    #The program returns a list `res` with the number of elements equal to `(en - be + 1)` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0s.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. l_i and r_i are positive integers for each i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. l_i and r_i are positive integers for each i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9. n is greater than or equal to r
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the result of dividing the factorial of n by the factorial of n minus r, where n and r are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ r ≤ n.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list containing the updated elements based on the calculation, `arr` has elements, `i` is the length of `arr` - 1
    return tem
    #The program returns the list `tem` containing the updated elements based on the calculation

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n. Each pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) represents the period of time when the i-th lamp is turned on.**
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the value read from standard input using `BytesIO` object and the lambda function registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
