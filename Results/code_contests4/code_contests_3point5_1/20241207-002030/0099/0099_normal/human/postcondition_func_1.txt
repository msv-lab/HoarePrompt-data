The function func_2 accepts two positive integers n and r, where n is not less than r. If n is less than r, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the result of dividing the factorial of n by the factorial of n minus r. It is important to note that the code does not handle any error cases such as when n or r exceed the specified constraints.
