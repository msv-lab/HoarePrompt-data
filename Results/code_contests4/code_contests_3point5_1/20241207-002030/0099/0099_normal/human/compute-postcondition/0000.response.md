Example Answer:
The code `sys.stdout = BytesIO()` redirects the standard output to a BytesIO object. This can be useful for capturing and manipulating program output before displaying it. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the values of n, k, l_i, or r_i. Therefore, the output state is simply that the standard output has been redirected to a BytesIO object.
Output State: **Standard output redirected to a BytesIO object**
