According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr` list. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tem` is a list containing the updated elements based on the calculation. In the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `arr` must be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **`tem` is a list containing the updated elements based on the calculation, for the loop to execute another time the length of `arr` must be greater than the updated `i`**
