Example Answer:
`tem` is appended with the sum of `tem[i]` and `arr[i]`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific values that will be added to `tem`. However, based on the logic provided, the length of `tem` will increase by 1 after the execution. 
Output State: **`tem` is a list containing the updated elements based on the calculation, with an additional element added**
