Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the number of queries and the segments for each query. It then prints two integers a and b such that l1 ≤ a ≤ r1, l2 ≤ b ≤ r2 and a ≠ b for each query. The logic for finding a and b is implemented in the `func_15()` function which is called for each query. The program handles the input constraints and the logic required to find the integers a and b as described in the problem statement. Since the program adheres to the problem description and works correctly for all possible cases, the correctness is True.
