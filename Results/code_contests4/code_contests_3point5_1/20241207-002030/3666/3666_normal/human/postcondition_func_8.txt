The function `func_9` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers such that `x` is less than `y`. It then swaps the values of `x` and `y` and performs the modulo operation iteratively until `y` becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the final value of `x`. The functionality does not handle cases where `x` is greater than or equal to `y` initially.
