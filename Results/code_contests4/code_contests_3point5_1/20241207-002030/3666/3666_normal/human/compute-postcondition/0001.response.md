Example Answer:
The values 'sep' and 'file' are assigned the values obtained from popping 'sep' and 'file' from the dictionary 'kwargs'. If 'sep' is not found in 'kwargs', it is assigned the default value ' '. If 'file' is not found in 'kwargs', it is assigned the default value sys.stdout. Therefore, after execution, the values of 'sep' and 'file' are determined based on the contents of 'kwargs'.
Output State: **'sep' and 'file' are assigned values based on popping from 'kwargs', with default values ' ' and sys.stdout respectively**
