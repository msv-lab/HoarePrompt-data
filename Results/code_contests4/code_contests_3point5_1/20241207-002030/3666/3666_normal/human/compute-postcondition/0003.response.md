According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If args is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, 'sep' and 'file' are assigned values based on popping from 'kwargs', with default values ' ' and sys.stdout respectively; 'at_start' is True. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, 'args' must not be empty and x should be the first element in 'args'.
State: **'sep' is assigned a value based on popping from 'kwargs', with default value ' ', 'file' is assigned a value based on popping from 'kwargs', with default value sys.stdout; 'at_start' is True, for the loop to execute the first time 'args' is not empty, x is the first element in 'args'**
