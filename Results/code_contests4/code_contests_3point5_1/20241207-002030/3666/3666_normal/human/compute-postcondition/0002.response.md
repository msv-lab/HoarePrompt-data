Example Answer:
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `'sep' and 'file' are assigned values based on popping from 'kwargs', with default values ' ' and sys.stdout respectively; 'at_start' is True.
Output State: **'sep' and 'file' are assigned values based on popping from 'kwargs', with default values ' ' and sys.stdout respectively; 'at_start' is True**
