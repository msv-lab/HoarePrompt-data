Functionality: **The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It assigns values to `sep` and `file` based on popping from `kwargs`, defaulting to ' ' and `sys.stdout` respectively. It iterates over `args`, writing each element to the `file` stream with the specified separator. It then writes the 'end' value from `kwargs` to the stream and flushes the stream if 'flush' evaluates to True. The function returns the integer value 16.**
