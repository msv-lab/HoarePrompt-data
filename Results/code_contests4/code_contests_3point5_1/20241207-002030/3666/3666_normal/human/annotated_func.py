    #The program returns an integer that is taken as input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user to input an integer and then returns that integer as the output. This function does not accept any parameters. It solely focuses on receiving an integer input from the user and returning it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input containing four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input containing four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i}. The function does not perform any further processing or validation on the input data.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that applies the int function to each element of the input obtained by splitting the user's input by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads the user's input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer using the `int` function. The function returns a map object containing the integer values of the input elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer. For each query, l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the input values split by space and converted to strings
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, splits the input values by space, converts them to strings, and returns a map object containing these string values. The function lacks error handling for cases where the input is not provided as expected or if the conversion to strings fails.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query input consists of four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by the function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It internally calls another function `func_3` to calculate a list of values. The program then returns this list of values as output. The functionality of the function `func_5` is to call the function `func_3` and return the list of values calculated by `func_3`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit, stack size, and starts a new thread with the target function `main`. This function does not explicitly return any value but initiates the execution of `main` in a separate thread.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer. Each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, and r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `q` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `q`
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of all the digits of the positive integer 'q'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of all the digits in that integer. It properly iterates through each digit in `n` and accumulates the sum. The function then returns the total sum of the digits.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(x):

    #The program returns a boolean value based on the bitwise AND operation between x and the negation of x AND the result of x - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter x and returns a boolean value based on the bitwise AND operation between x and the negation of x AND the result of x - 1.

    return x
    #The program returns the final value of x after swapping and performing the modulo operation until y becomes 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers such that `x` is less than `y`. It then swaps the values of `x` and `y` and performs the modulo operation iteratively until `y` becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the final value of `x`. The functionality does not handle cases where `x` is greater than or equal to `y` initially.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query consists of four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**

    gcd, x1, y1 = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns the values of gcd, x, and y after the calculations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. 
- In Case 1, if `a` is equal to 0, the function returns the values of `b`, `0`, and `1`.
- In Case 2, the function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, as well as the values of `x` and `y`. It then returns these calculated values.
- It seems that the function is using recursion to find the gcd and corresponding x, y values. However, it should be noted that the annotations mention the state of the program before the function call but do not provide detailed insights into the recursive process itself, potentially missing edge cases and specific logic details within the calculations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer parameter `n`. It returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` satisfies certain conditions based on the cases mentioned, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The function iterates through a loop to check additional conditions for the input `n`.

        #The program returns the sum of the value of `c` and the sum of the squares of the elements in `p`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` recursively calculates values based on the input parameter `n`. 
Case_1: If `n` is 0, the function returns 0 and 1.
Case_2: For odd values of `n`, it returns the sum of the squares of the elements in the previous result `p` multiplied by 2, added to a calculated value `c`.
Case_3: For even values of `n`, it returns the sum of the value of `c` and the sum of the squares of the elements in the previous result `p`.

def func_13():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from a file named 'input.txt' using sys.stdin for a series of queries. Each query consists of four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} where 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}. The function does not explicitly return any value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. It calculates the result of raising `x` to the power of the original value of `y` using a bitwise operation and returns this result. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, resulting in `res` being 1. The functionality does not account for negative values of `y` which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `q+1`, and `func_16(l1, r2)` will be called in each iteration. The specific impact of `func_16()` on the program's state cannot be determined without additional information.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` iterates over a range of values returned by `func_1` and calls `func_3` to get four integers `l1`, `r1`, `l2`, `r2`. It then calls `func_16(l1, r2)` in each iteration. The final values of `l1` and `r2` depend on the values returned by `func_3()`. There is no specified return value for this function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It assigns values to `sep` and `file` based on popping from `kwargs`, defaulting to ' ' and `sys.stdout` respectively. It iterates over `args`, writing each element to the `file` stream with the specified separator. It then writes the 'end' value from `kwargs` to the stream and flushes the stream if 'flush' evaluates to True. The function returns the integer value 16.
