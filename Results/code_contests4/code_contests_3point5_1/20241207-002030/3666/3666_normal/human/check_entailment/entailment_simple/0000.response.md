Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program consists of functions that handle input, perform calculations, and output results based on the problem description. Each function is well-defined and follows the problem requirements accurately. The program reads the number of queries, processes the queries, and prints two integers a and b for each query such that a belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and b belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2], ensuring a â‰  b.

The program handles multiple queries efficiently and outputs the required values for each query. The functions are structured to handle the input constraints specified in the problem description, ensuring the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for all potential cases, making it correct.
