Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program, the functions, and the code annotations, it appears that the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The program correctly handles the input of two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis and finds two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2, and a ≠ b. The code processes multiple queries effectively, ensuring that the answer exists and can be printed for each query. Additionally, the functions within the program perform specific tasks related to input processing, calculation, and output formatting, contributing to the overall functionality of the solution. Since no discrepancies or cases of incorrect behavior were identified in the code or annotations, the correctness of the program is deemed **True**.
