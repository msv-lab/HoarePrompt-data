The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from a file named 'input.txt' using sys.stdin for a series of queries. Each query consists of four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} where 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}. The function does not explicitly return any value.
