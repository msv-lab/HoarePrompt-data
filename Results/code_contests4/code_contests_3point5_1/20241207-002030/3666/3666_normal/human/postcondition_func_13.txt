The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. It calculates the result of raising `x` to the power of the original value of `y` using a bitwise operation and returns this result. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, resulting in `res` being 1. The functionality does not account for negative values of `y` which could lead to unexpected behavior.
