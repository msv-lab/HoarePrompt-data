Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads the number of queries and the segments for each query, then prints two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. The program correctly handles the input, processes each query, and prints the desired output for each query. It follows the problem description for every potential case, ensuring that the answer exists and is valid. Therefore, the program is correct.
