Example Answer:
The product of `n` and `m` is calculated, and then the result is divided by 2. Since the initial states of `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 1000, the output state will have the result of the division operation. 
Output State: **The result of (n * m) / 2 is included in the output state**
