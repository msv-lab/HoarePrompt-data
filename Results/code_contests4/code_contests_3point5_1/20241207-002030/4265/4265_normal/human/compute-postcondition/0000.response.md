Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. Since the values of `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, the values of `n` and `m` will be set accordingly based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 1000**
