Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply calculates the product of `n` and `m` and then divides it by 2 to get the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field. However, this logic does not take into account the restriction imposed by the Fairy Godmother's curse, which states that soldiers cannot be placed in squares where the squared distance between them equals 5. The code does not implement any mechanism to avoid placing conflicting soldiers, thus it fails to adhere to the problem description.
