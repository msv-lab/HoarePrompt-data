Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on the field without conflicting with each other. However, the program simply calculates the product of n and m, which does not take into account the constraints imposed by the Fairy Godmother's curse. 

The program should instead calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field following the rules specified in the problem description.
