Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on the field such that no two soldiers fall under the Fairy Godmother's curse, as described in the problem description. Instead, it simply calculates the product of `n` and `m` and divides it by 2 without considering the curse condition. Additionally, the program lacks error handling for invalid input values. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
