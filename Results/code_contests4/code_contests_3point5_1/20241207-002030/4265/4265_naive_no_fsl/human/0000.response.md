Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the total number of soldiers that can be placed on the field by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns and then dividing by 2. However, this logic does not consider the constraint imposed by the Fairy Godmother's curse, which states that soldiers cannot be placed within a squared distance of 5 from each other.

For example, in the case of input (2, 4), the program would output 4, indicating that 4 soldiers can be placed on the field. However, the correct answer should be 5, as placing a soldier at (1, 1) would conflict with soldiers at (3, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3), and (2, 4).

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
