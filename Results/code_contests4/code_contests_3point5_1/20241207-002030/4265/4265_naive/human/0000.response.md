Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field without conflicting. The program simply multiplies the dimensions of the field together and then divides the result by 2 without any consideration for the constraints imposed by the Fairy Godmother's curse.

For example, for the input (2, 4), the correct output should be 4, as Sir Lancelot can place his soldiers in the following locations: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4). However, the program would output 4, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
