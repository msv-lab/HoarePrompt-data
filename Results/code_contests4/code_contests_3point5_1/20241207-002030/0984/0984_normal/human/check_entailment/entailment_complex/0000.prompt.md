You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) with maximum arithmetic mean (1)/(r - l + 1)∑_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).

If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.

Input

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array a.

Output

Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.

Example

Input


5
6 1 6 6 0


Output


2

Note

The subsegment [3, 4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, and each element of a is between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 reads an integer from the standard input and returns it as the output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**n is a positive integer representing the length of array a, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.**
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers from the input list 'a' after converting them to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it implicitly assumes the existence of a list 'a' containing n integers. The length of the list 'a' is denoted by the positive integer n, and each integer in the list 'a' is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive. The function reads input from the standard input and converts the integers in the input list 'a' to integers. After conversion, it returns a map object containing these converted integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns the input from the standard input after removing any trailing whitespace characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The program reads input from the standard input and returns the input after removing any trailing whitespace characters.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a non-empty list with all elements printed out separated by a space
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in the list args and prints each element followed by a space. After printing all elements, it prints a newline character. The function does not return any value.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**args is a tuple of integers where the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the length of the array a, and the following n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represent the elements of the array a.**
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All integers in the `args` tuple will be written to the standard output in the order they appear in the tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5() iterates through the elements in the args tuple and writes each element to the standard output. The function does not return the maximum element from the array 'a' as indicated in the annotations. It simply prints all elements in args to the standard output. The function does not follow the preconditions stated in the annotations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
