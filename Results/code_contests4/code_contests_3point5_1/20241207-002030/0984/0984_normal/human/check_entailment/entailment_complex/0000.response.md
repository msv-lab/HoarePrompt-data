Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_5` does not return the maximum element from the array 'a' as indicated in the annotations. This violates the requirement of finding the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. Since the code does not handle this crucial aspect of the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be false.
