#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers with length n, and each element of a is between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 reads an integer from the standard input and returns it as the output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**n is a positive integer representing the length of array a, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.**
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers from the input list 'a' after converting them to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it implicitly assumes the existence of a list 'a' containing n integers. The length of the list 'a' is denoted by the positive integer n, and each integer in the list 'a' is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive. The function reads input from the standard input and converts the integers in the input list 'a' to integers. After conversion, it returns a map object containing these converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns the input from the standard input after removing any trailing whitespace characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The program reads input from the standard input and returns the input after removing any trailing whitespace characters.

def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a non-empty list with all elements printed out separated by a space
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in the list args and prints each element followed by a space. After printing all elements, it prints a newline character. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**args is a tuple of integers where the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the length of the array a, and the following n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represent the elements of the array a.**
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All integers in the `args` tuple will be written to the standard output in the order they appear in the tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5() iterates through the elements in the args tuple and writes each element to the standard output. The function does not return the maximum element from the array 'a' as indicated in the annotations. It simply prints all elements in args to the standard output. The function does not follow the preconditions stated in the annotations.
