The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it implicitly assumes the existence of a list 'a' containing n integers. The length of the list 'a' is denoted by the positive integer n, and each integer in the list 'a' is between 0 and 10^9 inclusive. The function reads input from the standard input and converts the integers in the input list 'a' to integers. After conversion, it returns a map object containing these converted integers.
