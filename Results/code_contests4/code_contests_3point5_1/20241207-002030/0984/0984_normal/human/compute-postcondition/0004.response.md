According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If there is at least one more element in the list, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, an integer value is written to the standard output. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `args` list.
State: **An integer value is written to the standard output, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more element in the `args` list**
