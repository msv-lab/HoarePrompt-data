According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If there are more elements in the `args` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, an integer value is written to the standard output. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `args` list.
State: **An integer value is written to the standard output, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more element in the `args` list**
