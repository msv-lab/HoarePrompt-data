Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the length of the array and the array itself.
2. It then calculates the maximum value in the array and counts the occurrences of that maximum value to find the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean.
3. The program correctly outputs the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean.
4. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description and there are no edge cases mentioned that the program does not handle.
