Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to correctly solve the problem description. The program calculates the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum value in the array, rather than finding the subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. The logic implemented in the program is not aligned with the problem description, hence it is incorrect.
