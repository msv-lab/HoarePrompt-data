Example Answer:
The value of `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the variables are known, where `r` has been updated and is less than `n+1`, `c` has been updated, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` has been calculated, for the loop to execute again `l` is less than or equal to `r-1`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1, and `r` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `r` is updated and less than `n+1`, `c` is updated, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated, for the loop to execute again `l` is less than or equal to `r-1`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is updated and less than `n+1`, `c` is updated, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated, for the loop to execute again `l` is less than or equal to `r-1`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1**
