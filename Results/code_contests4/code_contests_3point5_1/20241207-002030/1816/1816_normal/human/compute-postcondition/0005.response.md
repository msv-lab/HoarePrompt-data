Example Answer:
`l` is assigned 0 and `r` is assigned -1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `c` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted, `b` contains the mapped integer values of the input, `s` contains the sum of values in `b`, `c` is a list of zeros with a length of `m`, `l` is 0, `r` is -1.
Output State: **`n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted, `b` contains the mapped integer values of the input, `s` contains the sum of values in `b`, `c` is a list of zeros with a length of `m`, `l` is 0, `r` is -1**
