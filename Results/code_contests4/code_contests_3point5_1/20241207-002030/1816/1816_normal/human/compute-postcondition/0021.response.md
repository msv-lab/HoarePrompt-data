Example Answer:
The value at index `r` of list `a` is used as an index to access and increment the value at the corresponding index in list `c`. The value of `r` is less than `n - 1` and is incremented by 4. Therefore, the value at index `r` of list `a` is used to access and increment the value at the corresponding index in list `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1` and incremented by 4, values in list `c` have been updated based on the values at respective indices from list `a`.**
