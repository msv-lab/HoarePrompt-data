Example Answer:
The sum of all values in list `b` is assigned to variable `s`. The previous values of variables are as follows: `n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted, `b` contains the mapped integer values of the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted, `b` contains the mapped integer values of the input, `s` contains the sum of values in `b`.
Output State: **`n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted, `b` contains the mapped integer values of the input, `s` contains the sum of values in `b`**
