Example Answer:
The lambda function subtracts 1 from each value inputted after splitting the raw input. The variable `a` is assigned the result of the map function. The initial state variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted**
