According to the code, the loop can execute again if both conditions `r + 1 < n` and `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` are met. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need adjustment:
- `r` is increased by 1
- `r + 1 < n` condition should be met, so adjust it to `r + 2 < n`
- `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` condition should be met, no adjustment needed for this condition as it already satisfies

State: **Output State: `t` is 0, `r` is increased by 1, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `r + 2 < n` and `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` conditions should be met, `r` is increased by 1**
