Example Answer:
The value of `r` is increased by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `t` is 0, `r` is less than `n`, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1. After the execution, the new state is: `t` is 0, `r` is increased by 1, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1.
Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is increased by 1, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1**
