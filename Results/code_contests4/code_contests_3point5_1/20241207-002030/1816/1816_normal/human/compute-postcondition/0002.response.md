Example Answer:
The values in `b` are obtained by mapping the input values to integers after splitting the raw input. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted, `b` contains the mapped integer values of the input.
Output State: **`n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers, `a` contains the values inputted with 1 subtracted, `b` contains the mapped integer values of the input**
