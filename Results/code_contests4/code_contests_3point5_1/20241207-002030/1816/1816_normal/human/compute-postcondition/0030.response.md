According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is 0, `r` is equal to `n - 1`, `c` has been updated based on the values in list `a`, the loop has finished execution, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated as `r - l + 1 - s`. To execute the loop one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `r`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`t` is 0, `r` is equal to `n - 1`, `c` has been updated based on the values in list `a`, the loop has finished execution, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated as `r - l + 1 - s`, for the loop to execute the first time `l` needs to be less than or equal to `r`**
