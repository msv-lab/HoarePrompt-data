Example Answer:
`r` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `r` is less than `n - 1`, so after execution, `r` will have a new value greater than its previous value. The state of `t` remains the same. 
Output State: **For the loop to execute the first time, `t` is greater than 0 and `r` is less than `n - 1. After execution, `r` is incremented by 1.**
