Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current value of `ans` and `(r - l + 1 - s)`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `r` is such that `r + k < n` and `c[a[l]] >= b[a[l]]` for all k, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is updated, `l` is less than or equal to `r + 1`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1 for all values of l, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1 for all values of r, and `(c[a[l]] < b[a[l]])` is true.
Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is such that `r + k < n` and `c[a[l]] >= b[a[l]]` for all k, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is updated, `l` is less than or equal to `r + 1`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1 for all values of l, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1 for all values of r, and `(c[a[l]] < b[a[l]])` is true.**
