Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input. Since the input represents the counts of Jedi Knights with lightsabers of each color, the impact is that `n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights and `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers.
Output State: **`n` represents the total number of Jedi Knights, `m` represents the total number of colors of lightsabers**
