Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is equal to `n`, `c` has been updated based on the final values in list `a`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is calculated, `l` is greater than `r`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1, If `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `l` is incremented by 1, The value of `ans` is printed.**
