Postcondition: ***For the loop to execute the first time, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1`, and after execution, `r` is incremented by 1. The values in list `c` are updated based on the values in list `a`. If `c[a[r]] == b[a[r]]`, then `t` is decreased by 1, `r` is less than `n - 1`, and `r` is incremented by 1. The values in list `c` are updated based on the values in list `a`.***
