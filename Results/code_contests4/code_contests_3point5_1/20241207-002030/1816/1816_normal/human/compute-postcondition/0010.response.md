Example Answer:
The value of `a[r]` is used as an index to access the value in the list `c`, which is then incremented by 1. The value of `r` is then incremented by 1. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` is greater than 0 and `r` is less than `n - 1. After execution, `r` is incremented by 1. The values in list `c` are updated based on the values in list `a`.
