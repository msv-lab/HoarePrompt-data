Example Answer:
`t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially greater than 0, after execution, `t` will be decremented by 1. The values of `r` and the list `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1` and incremented by 4, values in list `c` have been updated based on the values at respective indices from list `a`.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1` and incremented by 4, values in list `c` have been updated based on the values at respective indices from list `a`**
