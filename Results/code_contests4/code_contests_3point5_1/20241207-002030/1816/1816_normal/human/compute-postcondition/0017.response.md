Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` is initially greater than 0, after execution, `t` will be less than 0. The values of `r` and `c` remain the same as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is less than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1` and `r` is incremented by 2, `c` is updated based on the values in list `a`.
Output State: **`t` is less than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1` and `r` is incremented by 2, `c` is updated based on the values in list `a`**
