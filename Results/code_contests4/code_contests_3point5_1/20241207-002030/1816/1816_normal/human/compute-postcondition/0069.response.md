According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `r + 1 < n` and `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `r` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `r + 1 < n`.
- `c[a[r]]` should be decremented by 1 to maintain the condition `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]`.
- The value of `l` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `l` is less than or equal to `r + 1`.

State: **Output State: `t` is 0, `r` is such that `r + k < n`, `c[a[l]] < b[a[l]]` for all k, `c[a[l]]` is greater than or equal to `b[a[l]]`, `t` is greater than 0, `ans` is updated, `l` is less than or equal to `r + 1`, `c[a[l]]` has been decremented by 1 for all values of l, `c[a[r]]` is incremented by 1 for all values of r, `(c[a[l]] < b[a[l]])` is true, `r` is incremented by 1**.
