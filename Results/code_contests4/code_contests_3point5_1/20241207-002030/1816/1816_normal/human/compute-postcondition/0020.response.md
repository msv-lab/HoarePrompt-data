Example Answer:
The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `r` is less than `n - 1` and is incremented by 4, and `t` is greater than 0, we can calculate the new value of `r`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1` and incremented by 4.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is less than `n - 1` and incremented by 4**
