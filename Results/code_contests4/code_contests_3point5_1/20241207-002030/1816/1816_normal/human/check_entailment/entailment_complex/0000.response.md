Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input data about the colors of lightsabers of Jedi Knights and the desired counts of Jedi Knights with lightsabers of each color. It then processes this data to determine the optimal distribution of lightsabers among the Jedi Knights based on the desired counts. The program calculates and prints the final answer, which is the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed from the sequence so that there is an interval with the prescribed counts of lightsaber colors.

The program uses two pointers to keep track of the subsequence of Jedi Knights and efficiently calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed. It loops through the sequence, updating the counts of lightsaber colors and comparing them with the desired counts. The final answer is calculated correctly based on these comparisons.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for the given input.
