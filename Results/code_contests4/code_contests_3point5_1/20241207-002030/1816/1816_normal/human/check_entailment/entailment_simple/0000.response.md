Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed from the sequence so that there is an interval with the prescribed counts of lightsaber colors. The program uses two pointers to keep track of the interval and updates the counts of each color as needed. It then calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights to be removed based on the counts.

The program handles all potential cases as it iterates through the list of Jedi Knights and colors, making sure to check if it's possible to select the desired interval. It then calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights to be removed if necessary. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly solves the given task.
