Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and processes them to determine the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed in order to select the desired interval with the prescribed counts of lightsaber colors. The logic of the program seems to be correct as it iterates through the Jedi Knights and adjusts the counts of each color accordingly. It also handles cases where it may not be possible to select the desired interval. The program terminates correctly and outputs the minimum number of Jedi Knights to be removed.

Overall, the program seems to follow the problem description and should work correctly for all potential cases.
