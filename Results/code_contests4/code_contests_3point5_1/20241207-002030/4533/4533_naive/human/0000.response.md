Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. 

For example, let's take the input:
```
5
1 2 3 1 2
```
The expected output should be:
```
3 2 0 2 0
```
But the given program outputs:
```
1 0 0 2 0
```
This shows that the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct number of floors that need to be added to each house.
