Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. It iterates through the list of floors in reverse order, keeping track of the maximum number of floors seen so far. It then calculates the difference between the current number of floors and the maximum number seen so far, adding 1 to account for the current floor. If the calculated value is negative, it is replaced with 0. Finally, it outputs the calculated values in the correct order. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
