Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of floors in each house into a list `floors`.
- It then iterates through the list `floors` in reverse order and calculates the number of floors needed to be added to each house to make it luxurious.
- The formula used to calculate the number of floors to be added is correct based on the problem description.
- The code correctly handles the case where the house is already luxurious and no floors need to be added (resulting in `0`).
- The output format also matches the expected output format mentioned in the problem description.
- The code seems to be following the problem description for all potential cases and the logic is sound.
