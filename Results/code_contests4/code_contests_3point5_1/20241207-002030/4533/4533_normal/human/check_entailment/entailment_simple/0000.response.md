Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. It iterates through the list of floors in reverse order, keeping track of the maximum number of floors seen so far. For each house, it calculates the difference between the maximum number of floors and the current house's number of floors, adding 1 to the result if the difference is positive. This ensures that the house is considered luxurious only if it has more floors than all the houses to its right. The program then prints the calculated values in the correct order. The program handles all possible cases and provides the correct output as per the problem description.
