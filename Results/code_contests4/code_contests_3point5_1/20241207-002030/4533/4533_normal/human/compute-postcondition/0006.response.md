Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the maximum value between `h` and the current value of `m`. The value of `h` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 element, `m` is the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` contains the calculated value or 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 element, `m` is the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` contains the calculated value or 0**
