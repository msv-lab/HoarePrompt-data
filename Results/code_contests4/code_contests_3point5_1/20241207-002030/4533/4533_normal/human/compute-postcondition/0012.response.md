Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`. The value of `m` can potentially change based on the value of `h`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers with more elements, `m` is updated to be the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` contains the calculated value or 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers with more elements, `m` is updated to be the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` contains the calculated value or 0**
