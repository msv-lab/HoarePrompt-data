Example Answer:
The value of `m - h + 1` is calculated and then checked if it is greater than 0. Depending on the result, either the calculated value or 0 is appended to the list `s`. The values of `n` and `floors` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 element, `m` is 0, `s` contains the calculated value or 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 element, `m` is 0, `s` contains the calculated value or 0**
