According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `floors` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 element, `m` is the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` contains the calculated value or 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements, `m` is the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` contains the calculated value or 0**
