Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n` and `floors` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is 0**
