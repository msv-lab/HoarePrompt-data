Example Answer:
The list `s` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is 0, `s` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is 0, `s` is an empty list**
