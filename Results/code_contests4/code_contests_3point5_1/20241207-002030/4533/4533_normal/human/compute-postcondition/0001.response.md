Example Answer:
`floors` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.next()` by spaces. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `floors` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
