According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `floors` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 0 and `s` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed, the `floors` list must have at least 1 element and `h` should be the last element in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `floors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 element, `m` is 0, `s` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `h` is the last element in the `floors` list**
