Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program defines a recursive function `func_2` to generate all possible combinations of weights and checks if the sum of weights on one scalepan is strictly greater than the sum on the other pan. 
- The function `func_3` is used to filter out weights that satisfy the given conditions. 
- The `func_4` function extracts weights available for Xenia based on the input string.
- The `func_1` function prints the result obtained from `func_2`.
- The program then calls `func_1` with the necessary inputs to determine if it's possible to put m weights on the scales following the given rules.
- The program covers all possible cases and provides a valid solution if it exists.
