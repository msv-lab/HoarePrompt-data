Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not seem to correctly solve the given problem description. There are several issues in the code that may lead to incorrect output.

1. The `func_2` function seems to have a logical error in the recursive loop. It is not handling the case where two consecutive weights of the same weight are not allowed. This could lead to invalid solutions being generated.

2. The `func_3` function is supposed to filter out weights that can be used based on the current weights on the scalepans. However, it does not take into account the rule that two consecutive weights must be different.

3. The `func_4` function is converting the input string of available weights into a list of integers representing the weights. However, this conversion does not consider the fact that only weights corresponding to "1" in the input string are available.

Overall, the code does not seem to correctly implement the rules specified in the problem description, so the correctness of the program is **False**.
