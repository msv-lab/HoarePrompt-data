The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `result`, which is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, either "0" or "1", representing the availability of weights. The integer `m` is such that 1 <= m <= 1000. The function checks if the first element of the `result` list is true. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by printing all elements in `result[1]`. If false, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return a value.
