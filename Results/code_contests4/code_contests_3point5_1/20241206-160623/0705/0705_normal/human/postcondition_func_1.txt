The function `func_2` accepts a string `l` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, an integer `w` with 1 <= w <= 1000, and a positive integer `m` with 1 <= m <= 1000. The function recursively modifies the string `l` by adding elements returned by `func_3` and then calls itself with the modified `l`, `w`, and `m`. If certain conditions are met, it returns True along with different types of values based on the cases. However, the actual code does not fully reflect the annotations provided as the annotations mention returning a list and calling `func_3`, which is not present in the code.
