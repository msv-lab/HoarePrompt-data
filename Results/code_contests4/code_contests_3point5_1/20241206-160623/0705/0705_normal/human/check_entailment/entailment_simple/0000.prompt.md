You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string consists of exactly ten characters, either "0" or "1", representing the availability of weights. The integer m is such that 1 <= m <= 1000.**
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The input string consists of exactly ten characters, either "0" or "1", representing the availability of weights. The integer m is such that 1 <= m <= 1000. The first element of the result list is true, 'YES' is printed. All elements in result[1] have been printed.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input string consists of exactly ten characters, either "0" or "1", representing the availability of weights. The integer m is such that 1 <= m <= 1000. If the first element of the result array is true, 'YES' is printed and all elements in result[1] have been printed. If the first element of the result array is false, 'NO' is printed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, w is an integer such that 1 <= w <= 1000, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.**
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns True and the string l of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will continue executing until `func_3` returns an iterable object. The loop will modify `l` by adding elements returned by `func_3`, `tmp` will be the result of calling `func_2` with the modified `l`, `w`, and `m`. If `tmp[0]` evaluates to True at any point, the program will return True and the second element of `tmp`. Otherwise, the loop will continue until `func_3` returns an iterable object.
        return False,
        #The program returns False

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting only of '0's and '1's, and weights is an integer such that 1 <= weights <= 1000.**
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns a list of elements from 'weights' that are greater than 'tmp' and not equal to the last element of 'seq'
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the integer value of weights which is in the range of 1 to 1000

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a string of length 10 containing only zeros and ones representing the available weights for Xenia, and an integer m representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales.**
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: w consists of 10 characters, either '0' or '1', m represents the total number of weights to be placed on the scales, and result contains the values of all indices where the corresponding element in w is '1'.
    return result
    #The program returns the values of all indices where the corresponding element in string 'w' is '1'


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
