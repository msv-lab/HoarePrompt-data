Correctness: **True**

The program defines four functions that work together to solve the problem described. 

1. `func_1` prints "YES" if there is a way to put m weights on the scales and prints the weights in the order they are placed if it is possible. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
2. `func_2` takes the input string of available weights, the number of available kilo weights, and the total number of weights to be placed on the scales. It then calls `func_3` to find the possible weights that can be used to balance the scales and recursively tries different combinations of weights to see if it is possible to place m weights on the scales.
3. `func_3` finds the possible weights that can be used based on the condition that the weight placed on the next scalepan must be greater than the weight on the other pan and not the same as the previous weight placed.
4. `func_4` finds the indices where the available weights are '1' and returns these indices.

The program follows the problem description as it checks all possible combinations of weights to see if it is possible to place m weights on the scales while following the given rules. It ensures that consecutive weights are not the same and that the weight on the scalepan must outweigh the weight on the other pan. It returns the correct result along with the weights if it is possible, and "NO" if it is not possible.
