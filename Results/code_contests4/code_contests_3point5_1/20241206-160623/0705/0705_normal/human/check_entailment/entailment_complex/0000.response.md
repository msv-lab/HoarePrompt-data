Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully adhere to the problem description. The `func_2` function is missing the implementation of calling `func_3` as mentioned in the annotations. This discrepancy could lead to incorrect behavior of the program, as `func_3` is supposed to return a list of weights that meet certain criteria. Without this functionality, the weights selected for the scales might not satisfy all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, there is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, making the correctness of the program false.
