Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. One specific case where the code does not work as expected is when Xenia has only weights of 1 kilo available and m is greater than 1. In this scenario, it is impossible to satisfy the second rule where each scalepan must outweigh the other, as the weights available are all the same. The code does not handle this edge case and may incorrectly output "YES" when it should output "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
