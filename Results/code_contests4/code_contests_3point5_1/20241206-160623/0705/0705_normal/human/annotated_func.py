#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `result`, which is a string consisting of exactly ten characters, either "0" or "1", representing the availability of weights. The integer `m` is such that 1 <= m <= 1000. The function checks if the first element of the `result` list is true. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by printing all elements in `result[1]`. If false, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return a value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, w is an integer such that 1 <= w <= 1000, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.**
def func_2(l, w, m):

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will continue executing until `func_3` returns an iterable object. The loop will modify `l` by adding elements returned by `func_3`, `tmp` will be the result of calling `func_2` with the modified `l`, `w`, and `m`. If `tmp[0]` evaluates to True at any point, the program will return True and the second element of `tmp`. Otherwise, the loop will continue until `func_3` returns an iterable object.
        return False,
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `l` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, an integer `w` with 1 <= w <= 1000, and a positive integer `m` with 1 <= m <= 1000. The function recursively modifies the string `l` by adding elements returned by `func_3` and then calls itself with the modified `l`, `w`, and `m`. If certain conditions are met, it returns True along with different types of values based on the cases. However, the actual code does not fully reflect the annotations provided as the annotations mention returning a list and calling `func_3`, which is not present in the code.

    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the integer value of weights which is in the range of 1 to 1000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `seq` of length 10 consisting only of '0's and '1's, and an integer `weights` in the range of 1 to 1000. If the string `seq` is not empty, the function calculates the absolute difference between the sums of alternate elements in `seq` and returns a list of elements from `weights` that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last element of `seq`. If `seq` is empty, the function simply returns the integer value of `weights`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of length 10 containing only zeros and ones representing the available weights for Xenia and an integer m representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales. It then iterates through the string and returns a list containing the indices where the corresponding element in the string is '1'.
