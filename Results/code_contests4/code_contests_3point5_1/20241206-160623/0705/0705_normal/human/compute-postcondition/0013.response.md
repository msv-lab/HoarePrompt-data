The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `w`, which is a string of length 10 containing only zeros and ones representing the available weights for Xenia, and an integer `m` representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales. After executing the function body, the program returns the values of all indices where the corresponding element in the string 'w' is '1'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_4 is to accept a string of length 10 containing only zeros and ones and an integer m, and return the indices where the corresponding element in the string 'w' is '1'.
