Output State: **The loop will continue executing until `func_3` returns an iterable object. The loop will modify `l` by adding elements returned by `func_3`, `tmp` will be the result of calling `func_2` with the modified `l`, `w`, and `m`. If `tmp[0]` evaluates to True at any point, the program will return True and the second element of `tmp`. Otherwise, the loop will continue until `func_3` returns an iterable object.**
