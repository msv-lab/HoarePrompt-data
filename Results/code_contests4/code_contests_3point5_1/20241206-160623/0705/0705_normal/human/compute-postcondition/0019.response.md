The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: a string `l` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's, an integer `w` such that 1 <= w <= 1000, and a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= m <= 1000. 

After executing the function body, the program may return True in multiple cases:
- Case 1: The program returns True and the string `l` of length 10 consisting of only '0's and '1's
- Case 2: The program returns True and the second element of the list `tmp`
- Case 3: The program returns True and the second element of the result of calling `func_2` with modified `l`, `w`, and `m`
- Case 4: The program returns True and the second element of the result of calling `func_2` with modified `l`, `w`, and `m`

Additionally, there is a case where the program returns False. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `l`, an integer `w`, and a positive integer `m`, and return True in multiple cases based on certain conditions.
