Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `i` to the `result` list. Since `i` is the current loop iteration, the value appended will be the current loop iteration value. The `result` list initially contains the value 2. After executing the code, the output state will be: w consists of 10 characters, either '0' or '1', m represents the total number of weights to be placed on the scales, and result contains the values 2 and the current loop iteration value.
Output State: **w consists of 10 characters, either '0' or '1', m represents the total number of weights to be placed on the scales, result contains the values 2 and the current loop iteration value**
