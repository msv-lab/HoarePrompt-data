Postcondition: ***`l` is a string of length 11 consisting of only '0's and '1's, `w` is an integer such that 1 <= w <= 1000, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `i` is 0, `tmp` is the result of calling `func_2` with modified `l`, `w`, and `m`. If tmp[0] evaluates to True, the program returns True and the second element of the result of calling `func_2` with modified `l`, `w`, and `m`. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if statement and continues with the next part of the program.***
