The function `func_3` accepts a string `seq` of length 10 consisting only of '0's and '1's, and an integer `weights` in the range of 1 to 1000. If the string `seq` is not empty, the function calculates the absolute difference between the sums of alternate elements in `seq` and returns a list of elements from `weights` that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last element of `seq`. If `seq` is empty, the function simply returns the integer value of `weights`.
