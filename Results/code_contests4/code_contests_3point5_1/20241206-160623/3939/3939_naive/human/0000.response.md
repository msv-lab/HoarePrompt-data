Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from the initial vertex D to itself in exactly n steps in a cyclic path. The program uses a memoization technique to store the previous values and calculates the current value based on the previous values. The modulo operation is used to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where n is less than or equal to 2. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
