Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an integer `n` as input.
- It initializes `memo` as a tuple (0, 3) to keep track of the number of ways to return to vertex D in n steps.
- It then iterates through a for loop for n - 2 times to update the values in `memo` based on the previous values of `x` and `y`.
- After the loop, if n is greater than 2, it prints the second value in `memo`, which is the required number of ways to return to vertex D in n steps modulo 10^9 + 7.
- If n is 1, it prints 0, and if n is 2, it prints 3.
- The code seems to correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases, as it calculates the number of different cyclic paths with the length of n from vertex D to itself.
