Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps in a tetrahedron. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways at each step and calculates the final result modulo 1000000007. The program handles all possible cases as defined in the problem description and returns the correct output.
