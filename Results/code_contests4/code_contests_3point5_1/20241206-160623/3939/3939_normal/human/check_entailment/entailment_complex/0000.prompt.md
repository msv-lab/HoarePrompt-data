You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a tetrahedron. Let's mark its vertices with letters A, B, C and D correspondingly.

<image>

An ant is standing in the vertex D of the tetrahedron. The ant is quite active and he wouldn't stay idle. At each moment of time he makes a step from one vertex to another one along some edge of the tetrahedron. The ant just can't stand on one place.

You do not have to do much to solve the problem: your task is to count the number of ways in which the ant can go from the initial vertex D to itself in exactly n steps. In other words, you are asked to find out the number of different cyclic paths with the length of n from vertex D to itself. As the number can be quite large, you should print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). 

Input

The first line contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 107) — the required length of the cyclic path.

Output

Print the only integer — the required number of ways modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Note

The required paths in the first sample are: 

  * D - A - D
  * D - B - D
  * D - C - D
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^7.**
def func():
    n = input()
    memo = 0, 3
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(n - 2):
        x, y = memo
        
        value = 2 * y + 3 * x
        
        memo = y, value % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, `i` is equal to n - 2, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `value` is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is 0, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, value is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD.
    if (n > 2) :
        print(memo[1])
    else :
        print(0 if n == 1 else 3)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, `i` is equal to n - 2, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `value` is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is 0, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, value is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD. If `n` is greater than 2, we print memo[1]. If `n` is not greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, `i` is equal to n - 2, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `value` is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is 0, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, value is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7; 0 if n == 1 else 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input within the range 1 <= n <= 10^7. It then iterates through a for loop updating the values of `memo` based on the previous values of `x` and `y`. After the loop, if `n` is greater than 2, it prints the second value in `memo`, otherwise, it prints 0 if `n` is 1 and 3 if `n` is 2.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
