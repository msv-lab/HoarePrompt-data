Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps in a tetrahedron. It follows the problem description by using dynamic programming to store the number of ways at each step, updating it based on the previous steps. The program outputs the result modulo 10^9 + 7 as required. The logic of the program is sound and it provides the correct output for all possible inputs within the specified range.
