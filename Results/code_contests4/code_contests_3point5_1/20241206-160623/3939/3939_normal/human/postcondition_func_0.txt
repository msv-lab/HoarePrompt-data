The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input within the range 1 <= n <= 10^7. It then iterates through a for loop updating the values of `memo` based on the previous values of `x` and `y`. After the loop, if `n` is greater than 2, it prints the second value in `memo`, otherwise, it prints 0 if `n` is 1 and 3 if `n` is 2.
