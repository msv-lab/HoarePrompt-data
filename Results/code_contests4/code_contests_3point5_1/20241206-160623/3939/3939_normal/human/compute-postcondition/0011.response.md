According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7, `i` is equal to n - 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to n - 2.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, `i` is equal to n - 2, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `value` is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is 0, value % MOD is calculated**
