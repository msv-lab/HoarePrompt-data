According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `memo` is 0, 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
