Example Answer:
The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a large constant used for modulo operations. The values of `n` and `memo` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, 3**
