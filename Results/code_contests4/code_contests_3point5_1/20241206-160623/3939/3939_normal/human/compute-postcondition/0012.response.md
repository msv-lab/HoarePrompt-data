Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the values of `memo`, which is 0. Therefore, after execution, `x` becomes 0 and `y` becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^7, `memo` is 0, `i` is equal to n - 2, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `memo` is assigned the value of `y`, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `value` is assigned the value of 2 * y + 3 * x, `memo` is 0, value % MOD is calculated, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
