Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description along with the annotations, it seems that the code aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. The functions are structured to handle the input data, perform the necessary calculations to determine if Alexey can enter the university based on the given constraints, and provide the output accordingly. The annotations also provide insights into the functionality of each function, and there are no discrepancies found between the code, annotations, and the problem description. Additionally, all the provided examples seem to work correctly within the defined constraints. Hence, the code is considered correct.
