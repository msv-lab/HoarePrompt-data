Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes input for the number of universities and their respective donation amounts and denominations, then uses binary search to determine if Alexey can pay the exact donation amount using coins within the specified denominations. The program outputs "Yes" if Alexey can enter the university and "No" otherwise, as required by the problem description. The implementation covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
