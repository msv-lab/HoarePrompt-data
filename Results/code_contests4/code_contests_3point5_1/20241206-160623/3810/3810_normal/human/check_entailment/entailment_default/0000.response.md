# Initial Assessment:
The problem description involves determining if Alexey can pay the required donation to enter a university using coins of denominations within a specified range. The code appears to take input for the number of universities and their donation requirements, then checks if it is possible to pay the exact amount using the provided denominations. 

The functions provided seem to handle input processing, binary search to find the suitable denominations, and output printing. It seems like the code structure aligns with the problem description. However, we need to analyze if the code covers all potential cases and if the output hints correspond to valid scenarios.

# Code Analysis:
The code seems to be structured to handle the input for multiple universities and determine if it is possible to pay the exact donation amount using the specified denomination range for each university. It utilizes a binary search approach to find the suitable denominations within the given range.

# Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the process of binary search to find the suitable denominations for paying the donation amount. It also mentions that the code should return "Yes" if Alexey can enter the university and "No" otherwise. The hints seem to align with the code logic.

# Final Verdict:
After analyzing the code, its structure, and the output hints, it appears that the code appropriately addresses the problem description and covers all potential cases. The provided functions handle input processing, denomination checks, and output printing effectively. Additionally, the output hints support the correctness of the code by describing valid scenarios in line with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
