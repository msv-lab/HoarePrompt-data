You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alexey, a merry Berland entrant, got sick of the gray reality and he zealously wants to go to university. There are a lot of universities nowadays, so Alexey is getting lost in the diversity — he has not yet decided what profession he wants to get. At school, he had bad grades in all subjects, and it's only thanks to wealthy parents that he was able to obtain the graduation certificate.

The situation is complicated by the fact that each high education institution has the determined amount of voluntary donations, paid by the new students for admission — ni berubleys. He cannot pay more than ni, because then the difference between the paid amount and ni can be regarded as a bribe!

Each rector is wearing the distinctive uniform of his university. Therefore, the uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of denomination more than ri. The rector also does not carry coins of denomination less than li in his pocket — because if everyone pays him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight and the pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of denomination x berubleys, where li ≤ x ≤ ri (Berland uses coins of any positive integer denomination). Alexey can use the coins of different denominations and he can use the coins of the same denomination any number of times. When Alexey was first confronted with such orders, he was puzzled because it turned out that not all universities can accept him! Alexey is very afraid of going into the army (even though he had long wanted to get the green uniform, but his dad says that the army bullies will beat his son and he cannot pay to ensure the boy's safety). So, Alexey wants to know for sure which universities he can enter so that he could quickly choose his alma mater.

Thanks to the parents, Alexey is not limited in money and we can assume that he has an unlimited number of coins of each type.

In other words, you are given t requests, each of them contains numbers ni, li, ri. For each query you need to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri berubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each denomination can be used any number of times.

Input

The first line contains the number of universities t, (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) Each of the next t lines contain three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 109; li ≤ ri).

Output

For each query print on a single line: either "Yes", if Alexey can enter the university, or "No" otherwise.

Examples

Input

2
5 2 3
6 4 5


Output

Yes
No

Note

You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins: one of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the second university cannot be paid.

Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function func_12 accepts a parameter `n` which is a string, and returns a list of integers where each integer is obtained by converting each character of the string `n` to an integer. The function converts each character in the input string `n` to an integer and returns a list containing these integers.

 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y` without a remainder, it returns the integer value of the division of `x` by `y`. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p

 Output decription for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts three integer parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where all three integers are in the range 1 to 10^9 and `x` is less than or equal to `p`. The function calculates the value of `res` within a loop based on the conditions provided and returns this calculated value. The loop manipulates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. It performs modular multiplication and right shifts on `x` and `y` during the loop iteration. Upon completion of the loop, the function returns the final value of `res`. It is important to note that the parameter `y` must be 0 for the function to execute correctly.
Function number 16 :

    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True

            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and True if `n` is not divisible by any numbers from 5 onwards that are in the form of 6k ± 1 where k is a positive integer. In summary, the function determines whether `n` is a prime number and returns True if it is, and False otherwise.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function `func_18` processes t queries, where each query consists of three space-separated integers ni, li, ri. The constraints for ni, li, and ri are 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri. The function sets the standard input to 'input.txt' and standard output to 'output.txt' for processing the queries. However, there is a missing functionality in the code as it lacks the actual processing of the queries or any explicit return value. It initializes the standard input and output streams but does not perform any query processing as indicated in the annotation.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        (n, l, r) = func_3()

            func_20('Yes')
        else:
            func_20('No')
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function `func_19` iterates over a range of values returned by `func_1`, and for each iteration, it assigns values to variables `n`, `l`, and `r` obtained from `func_3`. It then performs a binary search to check if a certain condition holds true, and based on the result, calls either `func_20('Yes')` or `func_20('No')`. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns the value 19.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
