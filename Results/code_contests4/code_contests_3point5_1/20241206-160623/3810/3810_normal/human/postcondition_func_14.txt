The function `func_15` accepts three integer parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where all three integers are in the range 1 to 10^9 and `x` is less than or equal to `p`. The function calculates the value of `res` within a loop based on the conditions provided and returns this calculated value. The loop manipulates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. It performs modular multiplication and right shifts on `x` and `y` during the loop iteration. Upon completion of the loop, the function returns the final value of `res`. It is important to note that the parameter `y` must be 0 for the function to execute correctly.
