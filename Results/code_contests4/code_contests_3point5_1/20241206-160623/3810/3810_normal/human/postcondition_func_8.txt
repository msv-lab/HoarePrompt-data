The function func_9 accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the number of universities), m (a list of tuples where each tuple contains three positive integers ni, li, ri representing the donation amount, minimum denomination, and maximum denomination for each university), and num. It returns a nested list where each sublist contains 'm' elements, and the outer list contains 'n' sublists. Each element in the sublist is 'num' for each tuple in 'm'.
