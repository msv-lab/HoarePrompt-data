The function accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user. The input consists of t lines where each line contains three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9; li ≤ ri). The function does not validate or process the input in any way, simply echoing it back to the user.
