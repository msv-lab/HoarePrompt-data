Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the file. The given initial state does not provide the value of `sep`, so we cannot determine the exact output. However, the variables `at_start` and `args` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is True, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is True, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `at_start` is False**
