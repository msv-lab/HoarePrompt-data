Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` are integers. If y < n, `low` is updated to 500000001, `high` remains at 1000000000, `f` remains at 1, `mid` remains at 500000000, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `y` being less than `n`. If y is not less than n, `low` remains at 1, `high` is updated to 499999999, `f` remains at 1, `mid` remains at 500000000, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `y` being greater than or equal to `n`.***
