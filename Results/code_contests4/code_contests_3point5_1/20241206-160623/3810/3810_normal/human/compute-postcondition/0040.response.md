Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are returned by func_3(), `low` and `high` are updated according to the loop conditions, `f` is 1, `mid` is the result of (low + high) // 2, `x` is the result of l * mid, `y` is the result of r * mid. The loop terminates when low is greater than high, and the final values of the variables are determined by the last iteration of the loop. Additionally, `f` is true.**
