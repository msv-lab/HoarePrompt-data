Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r` are returned by `func_3()`, `low` is updated according to the loop conditions, `high` is updated according to the loop conditions, `f` is either 1 if the condition `x <= n and n <= y` is met at some point during the loop, `mid` is the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l * mid`, `y` is the result of `r * mid`. The loop terminates when `low` is greater than `high`, and the final values of the variables are determined by the last iteration of the loop. Additionally, `f` is 0***
