Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2. The value of `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`. The loop condition might be satisfied for one more iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2; loop condition might be satisfied for one more iteration, `x` is `l * mid`, `y` is `r * mid`.
Output State: **`mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2; loop condition might be satisfied for one more iteration, `x` is `l * mid`, `y` is `r * mid`**
