Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the return values of `func_3()` to satisfy the loop condition for one more iteration; `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `mid` is the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2; `x` is assigned the product of `l` and `mid`; `y` is assigned the product of `r` and `mid`; x is less than or equal to n, and n is less than or equal to y.***
