Example Answer:
The `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` function call removes the 'end' key from the `kwargs` dictionary if it exists, otherwise it returns '\n'. The returned value is then written to the file. Since `at_start` is not affected by this code snippet, the Output State is: `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is False**
