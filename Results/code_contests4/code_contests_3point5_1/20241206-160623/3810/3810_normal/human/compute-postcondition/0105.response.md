Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the return values of `func_3()` to satisfy the loop condition for one more iteration; `low` is updated based on the if-else condition, `high` is updated based on the if-else condition, `f` is 1, `mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2; `x` is assigned the product of `l` and `mid`; `y` is assigned the product of `r` and `mid`; if x is less than or equal to n, and n is less than or equal to y, the loop condition is satisfied for one more iteration. If y < n, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. If y >= n, `high` is updated to the value of `mid` - 1. Moreover, `y` can be either less or greater than `n` based on the if-else condition.***
