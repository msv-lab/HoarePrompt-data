According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows:
- `n`, `l`, `r` are returned by `func_3()`
- `low` is either `mid + 1` or 1
- `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999
- `f` is 1
- `mid` is the result of `(low + high) // 2`
- `x` is the result of `l * mid`
- `y` is the result of `r * mid`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- If the current value of `low` is equal to `mid + 1`, update `low` to be `mid + 1`.
- If the current value of `low` is equal to 1, update `low` to be `mid + 1`.
- If `y` is less than `n`, no changes need to be made.
- If `y` is not less than `n`, update `high` to be the result of `mid - 1`.

State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are returned by `func_3()`, `low` is either `mid + 1` or 1, `high` is updated according to the conditions, `f` is 1, `mid` is the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l * mid`, `y` is the result of `r * mid`, for the loop to execute again `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
