Example Answer:
`high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `n`, `y`, `r`, `x` are integers. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is assigned the value of 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
