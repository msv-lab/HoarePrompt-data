Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `mid`, `low`, `high`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `f` remain unchanged. `low` is greater than `high`. If `f` is 1, `func_20` function is called with the argument 'Yes' and the condition `x <= n <= y` was met during the loop execution. If `f` is 0, `func_20` function is not called and the condition `x <= n <= y` was not met during the loop execution.***
