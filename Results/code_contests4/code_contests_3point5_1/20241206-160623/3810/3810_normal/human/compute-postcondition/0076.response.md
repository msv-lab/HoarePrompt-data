Example Answer:
The variable `f` is assigned the value 1. The values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `n`, `y`, `r`, `x` are integers and `x` is assigned the value of `l` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`, `f` is 1.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `n`, `y`, `r`, `x` are integers and `x` is assigned the value of `l` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`, `f` is 1**
