According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the `args` list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `at_start` is True at the beginning, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `args` list needs to have at least 1 element.
State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a list with at least 1 element**
