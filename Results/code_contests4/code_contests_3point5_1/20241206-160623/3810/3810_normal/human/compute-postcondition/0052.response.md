Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. The values of `r` and `mid` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `mid` is 500000000.
Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `mid` is 500000000**
