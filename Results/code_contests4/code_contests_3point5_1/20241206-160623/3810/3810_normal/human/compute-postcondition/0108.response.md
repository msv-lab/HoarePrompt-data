Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the result of `l * mid` where `mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2. The loop condition might be satisfied for one more iteration. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2; loop condition might be satisfied for one more iteration, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`.
Output State: **`mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2; loop condition might be satisfied for one more iteration, `x` is assigned the value of `l * mid`**
