According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000. To satisfy the loop condition for one more iteration, `n`, `l`, `r` need to be assigned the return values of `func_3()` where `func_3()` returns values such that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the return values of `func_3()` to satisfy the loop condition for one more iteration; `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0**
