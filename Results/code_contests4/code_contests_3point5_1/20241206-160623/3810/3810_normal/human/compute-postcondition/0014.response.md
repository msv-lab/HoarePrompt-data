According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `args`. If there are more elements in `args`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute again there must be more elements in `args`**
