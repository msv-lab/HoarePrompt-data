According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000. Both `low` and `high` are within acceptable values for the loop to execute, so no adjustments need to be made to `low` and `high`. 
State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, `low` needs to be less than or equal to `high`**
