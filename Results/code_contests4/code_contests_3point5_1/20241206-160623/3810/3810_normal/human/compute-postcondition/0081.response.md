Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `n`, `y`, `r`, `x` are integers. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is assigned the value of 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Regardless of the condition, the values of the variables remain the same after the execution of the if-else block.***
