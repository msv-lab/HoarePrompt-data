Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `y` are returned by `func_3()`. `low` and `high` are updated according to the loop conditions. `f` is either 1 if the condition `x <= n and n <= y` is met at some point during the loop, otherwise it is 0. `mid` is the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l * mid`, `y` is the result of `r * mid`. The loop terminates when `low` is greater than `high`, and for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions based on the loop variables must be satisfied in such a way that the loop can proceed to the next iteration.**
