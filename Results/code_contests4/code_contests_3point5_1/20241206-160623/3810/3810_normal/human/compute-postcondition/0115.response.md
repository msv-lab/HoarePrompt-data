Postcondition: ***`mid`, `low`, `high`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `f` are integers. If `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2, `x` is `l * mid`, `y` is `r * mid`, and `f` is 1. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Regardless of whether the condition `y < n` or `y >= n` is satisfied, the variables `mid`, `low`, `high`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, and `f` maintain their original relationships and values as described in the precondition.***
