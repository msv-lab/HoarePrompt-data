Example Answer:
The variable `mid` is assigned the value `(low + high) // 2`. This calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high`. Since `low` and `high` are integers and updated based on specific conditions, the value of `mid` will depend on those conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y`, `r` are integers and for the loop to execute again either `low` is updated to (mid + 1) and `high` is updated to 499999999 or `low` is updated to 1 and `high` is updated to 249999998.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y`, `r` are integers and for the loop to execute again either `low` is updated to (mid + 1) and `high` is updated to 499999999 or `low` is updated to 1 and `high` is updated to 249999998**
