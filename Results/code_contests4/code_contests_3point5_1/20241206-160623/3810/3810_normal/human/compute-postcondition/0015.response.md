Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the file. The loop will execute again only if there are more elements in `args`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute again there must be more elements in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute again there must be more elements in `args`**
