Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the final values of the variables `n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `y` will depend on the values returned by `func_3()`. The loop will terminate based on the conditions specified, and the final state of the variables will be determined by the result of the loop execution. If `f` is 1, `func_20('Yes')` will be called, indicating that the condition `x <= n <= y` was satisfied at some point during the loop. If `f` is 0, `func_20('No')` will be called, indicating that the condition was not met.**
