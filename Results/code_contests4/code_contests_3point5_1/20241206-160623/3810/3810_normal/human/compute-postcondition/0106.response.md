According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` and `high` have been updated based on the if-else conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, the updated values of `low` and `high` should satisfy the condition `low` <= `high`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are assigned the return values of `func_3()` to satisfy the loop condition for one more iteration; `low` and `high` are updated based on the if-else conditions to satisfy `low` <= `high`, `f` is 1, `mid` is the floor division of the sum of updated `low` and updated `high` by 2; `x` is assigned the product of `l` and `mid`; `y` is assigned the product of `r` and `mid`; if x is less than or equal to n, and n is less than or equal to y, the loop condition is satisfied for one more iteration.**
