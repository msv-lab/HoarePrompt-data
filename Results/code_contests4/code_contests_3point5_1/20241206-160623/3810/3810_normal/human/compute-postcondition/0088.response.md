According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute again, the states of the variables need to be adjusted accordingly. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop terminated due to the values of `low` and `high` not satisfying the loop condition. If `f` is 1, `n` will be within the range of `x` and `y`, otherwise `f` remains 0. The final values of `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` will depend on the values of `l`, `r`, and `n`. 

If the loop is to execute one more time, the states of the variables `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` need to be adjusted based on the values of `l`, `r`, and `n` that will allow the loop to continue based on the loop condition.

State: **The states of the variables `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` need to be adjusted based on the values of `l`, `r`, and `n` to satisfy the loop condition for one more iteration**
