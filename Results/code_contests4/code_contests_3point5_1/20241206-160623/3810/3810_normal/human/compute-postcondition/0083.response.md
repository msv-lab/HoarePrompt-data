Postcondition: ***If the loop executes until completion, `f` will be 1 if `n` is within the range of `x` and `y`, otherwise `f` remains 0. The final values of `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` will depend on the values of `l`, `r`, and `n`. The loop control variables `low` and `high` will have values that do not satisfy the loop condition, leading to the termination of the loop. Additionally, when the condition `if (f)` is met, the program state will be as described above.***
