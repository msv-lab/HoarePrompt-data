Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are returned by `func_3()`, `low` is either `mid + 1` or 1, `high` is the result of `mid - 1`, `f` is 1, `mid` is the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l * mid`, `y` is the result of `r * mid`. This if else block ensures that `n` is within the range of `[x, y]`**
