The value `x` is assigned the result of `l * mid`. Given that `l` is not defined in the initial state, the value of `x` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `mid` is 500000000.
Output State: **`low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `f` is 0, `mid` is 500000000**
