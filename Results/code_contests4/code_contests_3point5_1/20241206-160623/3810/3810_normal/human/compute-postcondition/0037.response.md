Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r` are returned by `func_3()`, `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or 1, `high` is updated according to the conditions, `f` is 1, `mid` is the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l * mid`, `y` is the result of `r * mid`. If `y < n`, then the program continues with the updated variables as described. Otherwise, the program continues with the initial values of the variables.***
