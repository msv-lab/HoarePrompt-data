Postcondition: ***The values of the variables `low` and `high` will not satisfy the loop condition, leading to the termination of the loop. If `f` is 1, `n` will be within the range of `x` and `y`, otherwise `f` remains 0. The final values of `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` will depend on the values of `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `f` is true, the loop will terminate and the final state of the variables will be determined by the values of `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `f` is false, the function `func_20('No')` is called, leaving the initial state variables `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `n`, `y` unchanged.***
