Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`, where `mid` is calculated based on the values of `low` and `high`. The values of `low`, `high`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is calculated based on the values of `low` and `high`, `low`, `high`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `f` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`mid` is calculated based on the values of `low` and `high`, `low`, `high`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `f` remain unchanged**
