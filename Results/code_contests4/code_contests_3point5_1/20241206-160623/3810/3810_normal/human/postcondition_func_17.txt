The function `func_18` processes t queries, where each query consists of three space-separated integers ni, li, ri. The constraints for ni, li, and ri are 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri. The function sets the standard input to 'input.txt' and standard output to 'output.txt' for processing the queries. However, there is a missing functionality in the code as it lacks the actual processing of the queries or any explicit return value. It initializes the standard input and output streams but does not perform any query processing as indicated in the annotation.
