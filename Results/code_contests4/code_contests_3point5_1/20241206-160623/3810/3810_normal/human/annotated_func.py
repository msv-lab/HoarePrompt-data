    #The program returns the input provided, which consists of t lines where each line contains three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9; li ≤ ri).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user. The input consists of t lines where each line contains three space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9; li ≤ ri).

def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element of the input taken from the user to an integer after splitting the input by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 does not accept any parameters and returns a map object that converts each element of the input taken from the user to an integer after splitting the input by spaces. However, since the return value is a map object, further processing may be needed to utilize the converted integers from user input in the program.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, then starts a new thread with the `main` function as the target. This function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The annotations mention the initial state of the program before the function call, indicating that `t` and other variables are positive integers within certain ranges, but this information is not utilized within the function itself.

    #The program returns a nested list where each sublist contains 'm' elements, and the outer list contains 'n' sublists. Each element in the sublist is 'num' for each tuple in 'm'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_9 accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the number of universities), m (a list of tuples where each tuple contains three positive integers ni, li, ri representing the donation amount, minimum denomination, and maximum denomination for each university), and num. It returns a nested list where each sublist contains 'm' elements, and the outer list contains 'n' sublists. Each element in the sublist is 'num' for each tuple in 'm'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_10(x):

    #The program returns True if x is a power of 2, otherwise False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_10 accepts a parameter x and returns True if x is a power of 2; otherwise, it returns False. The function checks if x is a power of 2 by performing bitwise operations. If x is 0, the function returns False.

def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is obtained by converting each character of the string 'n' to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_12 accepts a parameter `n` which is a string, and returns a list of integers where each integer is obtained by converting each character of the string `n` to an integer. The function converts each character in the input string `n` to an integer and returns a list containing these integers.

    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer division of x by y plus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y` without a remainder, it returns the integer value of the division of `x` by `y`. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `x, y, p` are integers such that 1 <= x, y, p <= 10^9, x <= p. The value of `res` will be the result of the calculation based on the conditions within the loop, `y` will be 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the value of 'res' calculated within the loop, where 'x' and 'p' are integers between 1 and 10^9 with x less than or equal to p, and 'y' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three integer parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where all three integers are in the range 1 to 10^9 and `x` is less than or equal to `p`. The function calculates the value of `res` within a loop based on the conditions provided and returns this calculated value. The loop manipulates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. It performs modular multiplication and right shifts on `x` and `y` during the loop iteration. Upon completion of the loop, the function returns the final value of `res`. It is important to note that the parameter `y` must be 0 for the function to execute correctly.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x is 5, y is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x, which is 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_16 accepts two parameters, x and y. It then performs a series of calculations using a while loop where x and y are updated until y becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the value of x. However, it is missing an edge case when y is initially 0, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and True if `n` is not divisible by any numbers from 5 onwards that are in the form of 6k ± 1 where k is a positive integer. In summary, the function determines whether `n` is a prime number and returns True if it is, and False otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input consists of t queries, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each query contains three space-separated integers ni, li, ri, where 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri.
def func_18():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` processes t queries, where each query consists of three space-separated integers ni, li, ri. The constraints for ni, li, and ri are 1 ≤ ni, li, ri ≤ 10^9 and li ≤ ri. The function sets the standard input to 'input.txt' and standard output to 'output.txt' for processing the queries. However, there is a missing functionality in the code as it lacks the actual processing of the queries or any explicit return value. It initializes the standard input and output streams but does not perform any query processing as indicated in the annotation.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, the final values of the variables `n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `f`, `mid`, `x`, `y` will depend on the values returned by `func_3()`. The loop will terminate based on the conditions specified, and the final state of the variables will be determined by the result of the loop execution. If `f` is 1, `func_20('Yes')` will be called, indicating that the condition `x <= n <= y` was satisfied at some point during the loop. If `f` is 0, `func_20('No')` will be called, indicating that the condition was not met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` iterates over a range of values returned by `func_1`, and for each iteration, it assigns values to variables `n`, `l`, and `r` obtained from `func_3`. It then performs a binary search to check if a certain condition holds true, and based on the result, calls either `func_20('Yes')` or `func_20('No')`. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns the value 19.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` takes no parameters.
