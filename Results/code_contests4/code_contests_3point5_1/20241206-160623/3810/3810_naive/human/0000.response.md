Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes t queries as input, each containing ni, li, and ri. It then iterates through each query and uses binary search to check if it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using coins with denominations from li to ri. The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented to find the appropriate denominations to pay the donation for each university. Since the program follows the problem description and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not work as expected, the correctness of the program is **True**.
