Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of universities and the donation amounts and limits.
2. It then iterates through each query and uses binary search to determine if it's possible to pay the donation using the given limits.
3. The program outputs "Yes" if it's possible to pay the donation and "No" otherwise.
4. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and it seems to cover all potential cases.
5. Since the program uses binary search to efficiently find the answer, it should work correctly for all input cases.
