Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input of n special points with their Cartesian coordinates.
2. It correctly calculates the area of all possible special quadrilaterals formed by selecting 4 points from the given set of special points.
3. It keeps track of the maximal area found so far and updates it if a new maximum area is found.
4. The program outputs the maximal area of a special quadrilateral as the final result.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and calculates the maximal area of a special quadrilateral correctly for all given inputs.
