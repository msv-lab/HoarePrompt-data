Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly by taking the number of special points and their coordinates.
2. It calculates the area of each special quadrilateral formed by selecting different combinations of points.
3. It keeps track of the maximal area found so far.
4. Finally, it outputs the maximal area of a special quadrilateral.

Since the program follows the problem description and there are no cases provided where the program fails to calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral, the correctness is deemed to be true.
