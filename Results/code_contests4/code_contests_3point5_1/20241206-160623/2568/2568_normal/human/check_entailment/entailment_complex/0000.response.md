Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program defines a function that calculates the area of a triangle given three points. However, the problem description requires finding the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by four points. 

The function `func_1` does not address the problem requirements as it calculates the area of a triangle, not a quadrilateral. Additionally, the function assumes input parameters for three points only, while the problem requires calculations for four points to form a quadrilateral.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is incorrect.
