Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The program only calculates the area of a triangle given three points, not a quadrilateral. Additionally, the function `func_1` takes six parameters `x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3` instead of taking a list of points as input. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem as described in the problem description.
