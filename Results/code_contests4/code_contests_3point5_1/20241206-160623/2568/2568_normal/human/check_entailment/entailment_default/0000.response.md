Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the area of a triangle using the provided coordinates and return half of this calculated area. However, there are several issues in the code:
1. The function `func_1` is defined incorrectly with parameters `x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3` instead of `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3`.
2. The calculation of the area in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The formula should be modified to calculate the correct area of the triangle given the coordinates.
3. There are multiple syntax errors in the code, such as missing commas in function definitions and incorrect variable names.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
