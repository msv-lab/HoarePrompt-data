The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`, all of which are integers. The precondition is that `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 300, and `xi` and `yi` are integers such that -1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000. The program calculates the area based on the initial values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`, and then returns half of this calculated area. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integer parameters `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`, calculate the area based on these values, and return half of the calculated area.
