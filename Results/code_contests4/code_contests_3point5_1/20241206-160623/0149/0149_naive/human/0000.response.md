Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color. The program first reads the input values of `n` and `p`, then subtracts 1 from each position value in `p` to make it zero-based. It then iterates through the pieces and calculates the total moves needed for even and odd positions separately. Finally, it prints the minimum of these two values as the output, which is the correct approach to solve the problem. 

The program handles all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description for every input scenario, ensuring that all pieces are placed in cells of the same color with the minimum number of moves.
