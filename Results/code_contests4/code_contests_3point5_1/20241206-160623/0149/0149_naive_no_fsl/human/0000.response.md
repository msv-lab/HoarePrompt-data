Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of the chessboard size and initial positions of the pieces.
2. It then calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color by iterating through the positions and calculating the distance to the nearest even and odd positions.
3. Finally, it prints the minimum number of moves required, which is the minimum of the total even and odd distances calculated.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Hence, the program is correct.
