You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given a chessboard of size 1 × n. It is guaranteed that n is even. The chessboard is painted like this: "BWBW...BW".

Some cells of the board are occupied by the chess pieces. Each cell contains no more than one chess piece. It is known that the total number of pieces equals to <image>.

In one step you can move one of the pieces one cell to the left or to the right. You cannot move pieces beyond the borders of the board. You also cannot move pieces to the cells that are already occupied.

Your task is to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color using the minimum number of moves (all the pieces must occupy only the black cells or only the white cells after all the moves are made).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, n is even) — the size of the chessboard. 

The second line of the input contains <image> integer numbers <image> (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — initial positions of the pieces. It is guaranteed that all the positions are distinct.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves you have to make to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color.

Examples

Input

6
1 2 6


Output

2


Input

10
1 2 3 4 5


Output

10

Note

In the first example the only possible strategy is to move the piece at the position 6 to the position 5 and move the piece at the position 2 to the position 3. Notice that if you decide to place the pieces in the white cells the minimum number of moves will be 3.

In the second example the possible strategy is to move <image> in 4 moves, then <image> in 3 moves, <image> in 2 moves and <image> in 1 move.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
