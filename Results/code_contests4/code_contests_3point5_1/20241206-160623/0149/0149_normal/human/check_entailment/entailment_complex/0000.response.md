Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the sum of absolute differences between the initial positions and their corresponding expected positions based on even and odd indices, and then prints the minimum value between the two sums. This approach ensures that all pieces are placed in cells of the same color with the minimum number of moves, as required by the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases where the input values meet the constraints specified in the problem description, ensuring that it always produces the correct output.
