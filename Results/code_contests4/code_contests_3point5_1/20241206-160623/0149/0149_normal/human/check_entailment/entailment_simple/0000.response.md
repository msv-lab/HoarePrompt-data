Correctness: **True**

The program takes in the size of the chessboard and the initial positions of the pieces as input. It then calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in cells of the same color. The program correctly calculates the sum of absolute differences between the initial positions of the pieces and their respective positions if they were to be placed in cells of the same color. It then outputs the minimum of these two sums, which represents the minimum number of moves required.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum number of moves needed to place all pieces in cells of the same color, as required by the problem statement.
