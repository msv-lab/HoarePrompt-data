Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of absolute differences between the positions and their corresponding expected positions on the chessboard based on even and odd indices, and prints the minimum value between the two sums. The code also handles the case where the positions are distinct and ensures that all pieces are placed in cells of the same color using the minimum number of moves. The output hints also agree with the code by describing the functionality of the code accurately. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
