The function `func` reads an even integer `n` representing the size of a chessboard and a list of initial positions, calculates the sum of absolute differences between the positions and their corresponding expected positions on the chessboard (based on even and odd indices), and prints the minimum value between the two sums. The function does not return any value directly.
