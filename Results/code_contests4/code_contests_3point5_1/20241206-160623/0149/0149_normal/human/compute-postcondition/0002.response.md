Example Answer:
Each element pi in the list p is decreased by 1 and the result is stored back in p. Since p contains distinct integers between 1 and n, after execution, p will contain distinct integers between 0 and n-1.
Output State: **n is an even integer representing the size of the chessboard, p is a list containing distinct integers between 0 and n-1**
