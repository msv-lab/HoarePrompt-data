According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n / 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an even integer representing the size of the chessboard and at least 2, `p` is a list containing distinct integers between 0 and n-1, even and odd have been updated based on the calculations mentioned. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So the next iteration will be for `i = 1`.
State: **n is an even integer representing the size of the chessboard and at least 2, p is a list containing distinct integers between 0 and n-1, even and odd are updated, for the loop to execute the second time i is 1**
