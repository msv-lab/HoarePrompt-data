Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer obtained from the standard input. The value of `n` represents the size of the chessboard, and it is assumed to be an even integer. The list of initial positions contains distinct integers between 1 and `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer representing the size of the chessboard, and the list of initial positions contains distinct integers between 1 and n.
Output State: **n is an even integer representing the size of the chessboard, and the list of initial positions contains distinct integers between 1 and n.**
