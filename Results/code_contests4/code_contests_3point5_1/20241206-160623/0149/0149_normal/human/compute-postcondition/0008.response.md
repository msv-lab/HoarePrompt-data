Example Answer:
The value of `even` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `i*2` and `p[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `i*2` is 2. Given that `p` contains distinct integers between 0 and n-1, the possible values of `p[i]` can be any integer between 0 and n-1. Therefore, the new value of `even` will depend on the specific values of `p[i]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is an even integer representing the size of the chessboard and at least 2, p is a list containing distinct integers between 0 and n-1, even is updated based on the specific value of p[i], odd are updated, for the loop to execute the second time i is 1**
