According to the code, the loop will execute n/2 times. Since n is an even integer, n/2 will be an integer as well. Therefore, the loop will execute if n is at least 2. Before the loop starts, p is a list containing distinct integers between 0 and n-1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to n is at least 2, even is 0, odd is 0, and i is now 0.

State: **n is an even integer representing the size of the chessboard and at least 2, p is a list containing distinct integers between 0 and n-1, even is 0, odd is 0, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0**
