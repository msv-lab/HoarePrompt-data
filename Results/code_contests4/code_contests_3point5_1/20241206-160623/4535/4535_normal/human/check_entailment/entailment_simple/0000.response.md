Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(x)`: This function takes a positive integer `x`, converts it to a string, reverses the string, and then converts it back to an integer. This function correctly implements the flipping operation described in the problem description.
2. `func_2(x)`: This function takes a positive integer `x`, adds it to the result of `func_1(x)`, and returns the sum. This function correctly implements the calculation of `a + ar` as described in the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly follows the problem description by finding a valid `a` without leading zeroes such that `a + ar = n` or determining that such `a` does not exist.
