Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, which are used to reverse an integer and calculate the sum of an integer with its reverse.
2. The problem description states that the program should find a valid integer 'a' such that 'a + ar = n' or determine that such 'a' does not exist.
3. The functions defined in the program correctly implement the logic described in the problem description.
4. The program handles the cases where a valid 'a' does not exist by returning 0, as specified in the problem description.
5. The examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the logic implemented in the functions.
6. Overall, the program follows the problem description for every potential case, and the annotations also align with the actual code implementation.
