    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is not divisible by any number from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)), then the loop will finish executing and the program will return True. Otherwise, if n is divisible by any number from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)), then the program will return False. A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1.
    return True
    #The program returns True if n is not divisible by any number from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)), otherwise it returns False. A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, and n is not equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n` and returns True if `n` is a prime number, otherwise it returns False. The function correctly checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root and returns False if it is. However, a missing edge case is that the function does not account for the scenario where `n` is less than 2, which should ideally return False as well. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine if `n` is a prime number by checking its divisibility and handling the case where `n` is less than 2.
