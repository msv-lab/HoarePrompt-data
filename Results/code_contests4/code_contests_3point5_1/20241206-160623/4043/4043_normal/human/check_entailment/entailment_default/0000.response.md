Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to return True if `n` is a prime number, otherwise it returns False. The function correctly checks if `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root and returns False if it is. However, a missing edge case is that the function does not account for the scenario where `n` is less than 2, which should ideally return False as well. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine if `n` is a prime number by checking its divisibility and handling the case where `n` is less than 2.
