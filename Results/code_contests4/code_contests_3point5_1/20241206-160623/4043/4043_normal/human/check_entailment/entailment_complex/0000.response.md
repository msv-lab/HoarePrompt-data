Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem description. The function `func_1` is actually checking if a number is prime rather than finding the maximum number of common divisors that can be chosen for two given integers A and B. Additionally, the program does not handle the scenario where A and B are given as input and the maximum number of divisors need to be calculated based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect for the given task.
