Postcondition: ***A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1, n is greater than or equal to 4, n is not divisible by k, for the loop to execute again k must be less than int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2. If n is divisible by k, the program returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
