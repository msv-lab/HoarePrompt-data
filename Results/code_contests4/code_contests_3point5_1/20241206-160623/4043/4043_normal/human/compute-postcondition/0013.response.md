Output State: **If n is not divisible by any number from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)), then the loop will finish executing and the program will return True. Otherwise, if n is divisible by any number from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)), then the program will return False. A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1.**
