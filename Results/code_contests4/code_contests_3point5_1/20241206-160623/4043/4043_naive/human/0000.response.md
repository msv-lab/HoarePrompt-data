Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description for all potential cases. 

For example, if we take the input: 
A = 12
B = 18

The program should output 3 as the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen to satisfy the condition. However, the program may not output the correct result for this input, as it may not handle all cases where the chosen divisors are coprime. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is false as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
