Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads two positive integers A and B from the input.
2. It correctly calculates the divisors of A and B by iterating up to the square root of A and B.
3. It checks for common divisors between A and B and increments the count if the common divisor is coprime.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen to satisfy the condition.
5. The program uses the math module for square root calculation and checks for prime numbers.
6. The program logic aligns with the problem description and works correctly for all provided examples.
