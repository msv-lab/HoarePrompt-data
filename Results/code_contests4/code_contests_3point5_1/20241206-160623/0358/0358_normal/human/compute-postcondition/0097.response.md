Postcondition: ***`last`, `delta`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `logtime`, and `n` are integers. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1 and the slice `logtime[last:]` still has elements. The total seconds between `now` and `x` is calculated as `delta` and its value is printed. Otherwise, `last` is incremented by 1, `delta`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `logtime`, and `n` remain integers, the slice `logtime[last:]` still has elements, the total seconds between `now` and `x` is calculated as `delta` and its value is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
