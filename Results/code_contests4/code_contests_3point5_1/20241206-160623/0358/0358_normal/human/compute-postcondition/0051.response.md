Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `delta` is printed to the console. `delta` is a value less than `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **The value of `delta` is printed to the console. `delta` is a value less than `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
