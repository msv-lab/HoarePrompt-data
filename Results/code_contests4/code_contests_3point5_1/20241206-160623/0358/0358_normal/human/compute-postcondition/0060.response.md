Example Answer:
`delta` is assigned the value of `int((now - x).total_seconds())`. The value of `delta` is used to check if it is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is true, then the value of `last` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `last` and `delta` are unknown, so the output state is: `last` and `delta` are integers.
Output State: **`last` and `delta` are integers**
