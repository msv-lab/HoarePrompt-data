Postcondition: ***`last`, `delta`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `logtime`, and `n` are integers. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1. The value of `delta` is printed. After the if-else block executes, `last` is incremented by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
