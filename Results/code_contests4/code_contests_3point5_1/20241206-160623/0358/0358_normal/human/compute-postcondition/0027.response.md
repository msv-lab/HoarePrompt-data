Example Answer:
`delta` is assigned the value of the time difference in seconds between `now` and `x`, where `now` is the current time. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is the time difference in seconds, `last` may be increased by 1 if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`delta` is the time difference in seconds, `last` may be increased by 1 if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`**
