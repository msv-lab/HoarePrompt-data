Output State: **`last`, `delta`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `logtime`, and `n` are integers. The loop continues until `delta` is less than `n`, incrementing `last` each time. After the loop finishes, `last` will be the number of times `delta` was greater than or equal to `n` in the loop. The length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m.**
