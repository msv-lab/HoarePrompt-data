Example Answer:
`last` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the value of `last`, so after execution, `last` will be 1 greater than its initial value. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is the time difference in seconds, `last` is 1 greater than its initial value.
Output State: **`delta` is the time difference in seconds, `last` is 1 greater than its initial value**
