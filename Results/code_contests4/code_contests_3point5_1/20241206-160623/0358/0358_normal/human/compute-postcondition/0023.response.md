Example Answer:
The value of `last` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `last` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is the integer value representing the time difference in seconds, `last` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`delta` is the integer value representing the time difference in seconds, `last` is increased by 1**
