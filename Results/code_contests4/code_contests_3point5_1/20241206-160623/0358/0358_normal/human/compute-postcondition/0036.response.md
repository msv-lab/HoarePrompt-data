Postcondition: ***`last` is the number of times `delta` was greater than or equal to `n`, `delta` is the time difference in seconds between `now` and each `x` in `logtime`, all other variables retain their initial values. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
