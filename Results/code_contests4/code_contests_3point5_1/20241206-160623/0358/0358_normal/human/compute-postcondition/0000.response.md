Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values extracted from the input using the `map` function. The values of `n` and `m` can be any integers between 1 and 10000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10000**
