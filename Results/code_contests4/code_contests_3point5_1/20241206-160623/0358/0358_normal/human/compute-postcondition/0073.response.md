Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`. The variables `last`, `delta`, `year`, `month`, and `day` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `last` and `delta` are integers, `year`, `month`, and `day` are assigned values extracted from `line`, `b` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`.
Output State: **`last` and `delta` are integers, `year`, `month`, and `day` are assigned values extracted from `line`, `b` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`**
