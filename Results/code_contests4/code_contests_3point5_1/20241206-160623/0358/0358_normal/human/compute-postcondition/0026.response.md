According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `delta`, `n`, and `last`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `delta` is an integer, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `delta` must be greater than or equal to `n`.
State: **`delta` is an integer representing the time difference in seconds and is greater than or equal to `n`, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is increased by 1**
