Example Answer:
The variable `log` is assigned the result of `sys.stdin.readlines()`, which reads all lines from the standard input. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10000**
