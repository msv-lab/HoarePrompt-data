Output State: **`last` is the updated number of times `delta` was greater than or equal to `n`, `delta` is the time difference in seconds between `now` and the next `x` in `logtime`, `a` is the index of the first space in `line`, all other variables retain their initial values. If the length of `logtime` minus the updated `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the loop can execute another time.**
