Example Answer:
The variables `year`, `month`, and `day` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input `line` up to index `a` after splitting by '-'. The values of `line` and `a` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the specific values of `year`, `month`, and `day`. Therefore, the Output State is: `last` and `delta` are integers, `year`, `month`, and `day` are assigned values extracted from `line`.
Output State: **`last` and `delta` are integers, `year`, `month`, and `day` are assigned values extracted from `line`**
