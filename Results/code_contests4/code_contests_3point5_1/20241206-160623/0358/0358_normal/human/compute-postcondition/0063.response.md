Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `last` and `delta` are integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`last` and `delta` are integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
