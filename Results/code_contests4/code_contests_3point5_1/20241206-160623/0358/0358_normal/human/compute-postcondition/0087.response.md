Example Answer: 
`delta` is assigned the value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `last`, `delta`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `logtime`, and `n` are integers. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`last`, `delta`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `logtime`, and `n` are integers. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1**
