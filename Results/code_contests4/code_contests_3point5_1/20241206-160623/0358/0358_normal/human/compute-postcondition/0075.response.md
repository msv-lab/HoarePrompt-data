Example Answer:
`now` is assigned a datetime object using the values of `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. The variables `last`, `delta`, `year`, `month`, `day`, and `b` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`last` and `delta` are integers, `year`, `month`, and `day` are assigned values extracted from `line`, `b` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`**
