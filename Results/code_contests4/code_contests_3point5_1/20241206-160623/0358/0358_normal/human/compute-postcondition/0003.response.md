Example Answer: 
`last` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `logtime` is an empty list, `last` is 0**
