Postcondition: ***The difference in seconds between the current datetime object `now` and `x` is printed. If the difference is greater than or equal to `n` seconds, `last` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the difference is less than `n` seconds, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
