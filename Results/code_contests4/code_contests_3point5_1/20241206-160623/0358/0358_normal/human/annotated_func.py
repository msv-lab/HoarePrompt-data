#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** The input consists of two space-separated integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000. The log stream contains records in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE", where "MESSAGE" can contain spaces, uppercase and lowercase English letters, and characters "!", ".", ",", "?". The date "2012-MM-DD" and time "HH:MM:SS" in each record are correct. The total length of all lines in the log stream does not exceed 5·10^6 characters.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    log = sys.stdin.readlines()
    logtime = []
    last = 0
    for line in log:
        a = line.find(' ')
        
        year, month, day = map(int, line[:a].split('-'))
        
        b = line.rfind(':')
        
        hour, minute, second = map(int, line[a:b].split(':'))
        
        now = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
        
        logtime.append(now)
        
        print(line[:b], last)
        
        for x in logtime[last:]:
            delta = int((now - x).total_seconds())
            print(delta)
            if delta >= n:
                last += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if len(logtime) - last >= m:
            print(line[:b])
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `last` is the number of times `delta` was greater than or equal to `n`, `delta` is the time difference in seconds between `now` and each `x` in `logtime`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `logtime`, and `n` are integers, all other variables retain their initial values. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, processes a log stream containing records in the format "2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE", and calculates time differences between log entries. It keeps track of the number of times the time difference is greater than or equal to `n` and stops processing if the length of log entries surpasses `m`. The function does not return any specific value but may output certain log entries based on the processing.
