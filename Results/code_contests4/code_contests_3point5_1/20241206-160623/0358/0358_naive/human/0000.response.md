Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition `if delta >= n`. The condition should be `if delta > n` in order to check if the number of warnings for the last n seconds was not less than m. This would cause incorrect output for some cases. For example, if n = 1 and m = 2, the program would output `-1` for the input:
