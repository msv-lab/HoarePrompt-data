Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the queries of type 2 correctly. The function `func_3` is not implemented properly to calculate the number of different characters occurring in the substring between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive). The current implementation of `func_3` always returns the total number of characters in the substring, instead of counting the number of different characters.

The issue arises from the loop that iterates over all 26 characters and checks if the function `func_3(l, r + 1)` is not equal to 0. This check will always be true because `func_3` returns the total count of characters in the substring, which will almost always be greater than 0.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for queries of type 2.

To correct this, the program needs to be modified to properly count the number of different characters in the substring.
