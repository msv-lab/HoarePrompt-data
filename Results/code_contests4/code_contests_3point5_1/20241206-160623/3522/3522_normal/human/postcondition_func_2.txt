The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, performs a series of operations within a loop where 'res' is increased by 'n' after each iteration, 'l' is incremented by 'n' and becomes the next odd number, and 'r' is set to be greater than the initial value of 'l' + 'n'. After the loop finishes, 'l' is right-shifted by 1 and 'r' is also right-shifted by 1. The function then returns the final value of 'res'. The annotations mention specific variable states and operations that may not align with the actual code logic, potentially causing discrepancies.
