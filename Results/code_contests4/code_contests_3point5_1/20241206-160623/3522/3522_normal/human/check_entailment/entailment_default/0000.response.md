Correctness: **False**

The function `func_3` does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. In the problem description, for each query of type 2, the function should answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive). However, in the code implementation, the function iterates over all 26 letters of the alphabet for every query of type 2, and increments the `ans` variable if `func_3(l, r + 1)` returns a non-zero value. This means that it counts the occurrence of any character in the entire substring between l_q and r_q, not just the different characters. As a result, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
