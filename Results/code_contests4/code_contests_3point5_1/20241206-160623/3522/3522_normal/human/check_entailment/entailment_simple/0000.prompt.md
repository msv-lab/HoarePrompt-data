You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process Q queries of the following two types:

* Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
* Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

* N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
* S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* c_q is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 \leq N \leq 500000
* 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
* |S| = N
* 1 \leq i_q \leq N
* 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
* There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q


Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:


1 i_q c_q



2 l_q r_q


Output

For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

Example

Input

7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7


Output

3

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tree[ddd][n]` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, `tree[ddd][n + 1]` is assigned the value of `arr[1]`, ..., `tree[ddd][n + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]` for every iteration of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tree[ddd][i]` is updated to the sum of `tree[ddd][i << 1]` and `tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]` for all values of `i` from `n-1` to `1`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 1, elements in the `tree` list are updated based on the operations performed in each iteration of the loop

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- N is an integer representing the length of the string S.
- S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Q is an integer representing the number of queries to process.
- i_q, l_q, r_q are integers representing positions in the string S.
- c_q is a lowercase English letter.
- 1 <= N <= 500000
- 1 <= Q <= 20000
- 1 <= i_q <= N
- 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `ddd`, and `tree` are integers. `res` and `l` are increased by `n` after each iteration of the loop. `l` becomes the next odd number after each iteration. `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`. After the loop finishes, `l` is right shifted by 1, `r` is right shifted by 1.
    return res
    #The program returns the final value of 'res' after the loop finishes. 'res' and 'l' are increased by 'n' after each iteration of the loop, 'l' becomes the next odd number after each iteration, 'r' is greater than the initial value of 'l' + 'n'. After the loop finishes, 'l' is right shifted by 1, 'r' is right shifted by 1.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
