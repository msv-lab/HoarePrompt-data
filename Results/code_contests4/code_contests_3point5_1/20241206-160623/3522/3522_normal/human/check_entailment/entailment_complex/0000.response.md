Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations indicate certain operations and variable states that may not align with the code logic, potentially causing discrepancies. Without a thorough analysis of the actual code and testing with different scenarios, it is difficult to confirm the correctness of the program. In order to verify the correctness of the program, a detailed review of the code logic and potential edge cases would be necessary.
