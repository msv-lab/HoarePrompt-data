Output State: **`res`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `ddd`, and `tree` are integers. `res` and `l` are increased by `n` after each iteration of the loop. `l` becomes the next odd number after each iteration. `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`. After the loop finishes, `l` is right shifted by 1, `r` is right shifted by 1.**
