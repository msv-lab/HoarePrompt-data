Output State: **`res`, `l`, `n`, and `r` are integers. If `l` was an odd number, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`, where `l` becomes the next odd number. Additionally, `r` must be greater than the new value of `l` + `n` for the loop to execute again. After the if-else block executes, `r` is decreased by 1. `res` is incremented by the value at `tree[ddd][r]` if `r` is odd. Finally, `r` is right shifted by 1.**
