Output State: **`res` and `l` are increased by `n`, if `l` is odd, `res` is also increased by `tree[ddd][l]`, `l` becomes the next odd number after the initial odd number, and `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`. Additionally, `r` is an odd number, `r` is an odd number, `res` is further increased by `tree[ddd][r]`.**
