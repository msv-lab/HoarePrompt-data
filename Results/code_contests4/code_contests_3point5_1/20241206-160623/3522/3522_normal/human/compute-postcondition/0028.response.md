Example Answer:
The value of `r` is decreased by 1, but the previous value of `r` is unknown. Then, `res` is added to the value `tree[ddd][r]`. The final state will depend on the values of `res`, `tree[ddd][r]`, and the initial value of `r`. Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the specific values of `res`, `tree[ddd][r]`, and the initial value of `r`.
Output State: **Dependent on the specific values of `res`, `tree[ddd][r]`, and the initial value of `r`**
