Output State: **`res`, `l`, `n`, and `r` are integers, `l` is an odd number, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`, `l` becomes the next odd number, `r` is greater than the new value of `l` + `n`, `r` is decreased by 1, `res` is incremented by the value at `tree[ddd][l]` if `r` is odd, and `r` is right shifted by 1**
