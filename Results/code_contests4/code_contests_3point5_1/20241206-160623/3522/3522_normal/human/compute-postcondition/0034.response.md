The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. 
- 'l' and 'r' are integers representing positions in a string.
- 'res' is a variable that holds a value that is increased by 'n' after each iteration of the loop.
- 'l' is increased by 'n' after each iteration and becomes the next odd number.
- 'r' is greater than the initial value of 'l' + 'n'.
- After the loop finishes, 'l' is right shifted by 1 and 'r' is right shifted by 1.
The program returns the final value of 'res' after the loop finishes. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integer parameters `l` and `r`, perform a series of operations as described above, and return the final value of 'res' after the loop finishes.
