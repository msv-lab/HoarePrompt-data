Example Answer: 
The value of `l` is right-shifted by 1. This means `l` is divided by 2 and any fractional part is truncated. The previous value of `l` is increased by `n`. If `r` was odd, it remains odd after the right shift. The value of `res` is dependent on `l` and `r` conditions, so the final value of `res` may or may not change based on the conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `res`, `l`, `r`, and `n` are integers. Initially, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`. If `l` is odd, `res` is also increased by `tree[ddd][l]`, `l` becomes the next odd number after the initial odd number, and `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`. If `r` is an odd number, `res` is further increased by `tree[ddd][r]`.
Output State: **`res`, `l`, `r`, and `n` are integers. Initially, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`. If `l` is odd, `res` is also increased by `tree[ddd][l]`, `l` becomes the next odd number after the initial odd number, and `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`. If `r` is an odd number, `res` is further increased by `tree[ddd][r]`.**
