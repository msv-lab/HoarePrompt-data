Example Answer:
The value of `l` is incremented by 1, and `l` was initially an odd number. Therefore, after execution, `l` remains an odd number + 1. The values of `res` and `tree[ddd][l]` are not affected. The value of `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`. 
Output State: **`res` is increased by `n` and `tree[ddd][l]`, `l` is an odd number + 1, `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`**
