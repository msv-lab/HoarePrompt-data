According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `res` is increased by `n`, `l` is increased by `n`. In order for the loop to execute the first time, `l` needs to be less than `r`. Therefore, `r` should be greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is increased by `n`, `l` is increased by `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`**
