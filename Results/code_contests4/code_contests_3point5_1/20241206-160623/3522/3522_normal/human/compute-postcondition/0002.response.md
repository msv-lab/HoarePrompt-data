Example Answer:
`r` is incremented by `n`, but the initial state of `r` is not provided. Since the initial state of `res` is 0, assuming `res` is the same as `r`, after execution, `res` is increased by `n`. The state of `l` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is increased by `n`, `l` is increased by `n`.
Output State: **`res` is increased by `n`, `l` is increased by `n`**
