Postcondition: ***`res`, `l`, `n`, and `r` are integers. For the loop to execute again, `l` was an odd number. After the execution of the if else block, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`. `l` becomes the next odd number. `r` is greater than the new value of `l` + `n`. `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` is odd, `res` is incremented by the value at `tree[ddd][l]`. `r` is right shifted by 1.***
