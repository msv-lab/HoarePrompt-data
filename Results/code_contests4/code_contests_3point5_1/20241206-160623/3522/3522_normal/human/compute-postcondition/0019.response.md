Output State: **`res`, `l`, and `n` are integers. If `l` is an odd number, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`, where `l` is the next odd number. Additionally, `r` is greater than the new value of `l` + `n` for the loop to execute again. `r` is decreased by 1. `res` is incremented by the value at `tree[ddd][r]`.**
