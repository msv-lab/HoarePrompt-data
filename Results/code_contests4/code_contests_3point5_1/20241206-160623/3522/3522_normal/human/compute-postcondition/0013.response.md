Example Answer: 
The value of `r` is right-shifted by 1 bit. The previous value of `r` is unknown, so after execution, the new value of `r` will be half of its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res`, `l`, `n` are integers, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`, `l` is next odd number, `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`.
Output State: **`res`, `l`, `n` are integers, `res` and `l` are increased by `n`, `l` is next odd number, `r` is greater than the initial value of `l` + `n`.**
