Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the `func_3` function where it calculates the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive). However, the function does not correctly handle this calculation and always returns the total count of different characters in the entire string S instead of the specified substring.

To demonstrate the issue, consider the following input and output:
Input:
```
7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7
```
Expected Output:
```
3
1
1
1
1
```
In the provided code, the function `func_3` is not correctly calculating the number of different characters in the specified substring of S.
