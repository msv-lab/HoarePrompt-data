Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and finds the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences. It uses a stack to keep track of the maximum element and the second maximum element encountered so far. The function then returns the maximum lucky number found.

The program reads the input values, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the result, which seems to be in line with the problem description. The logic of the program appears to correctly find the maximum lucky number for the given input sequences, making the program correct.
