Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the current `ans` value and the result of the XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`. Since `stack` contains the value of `i`, and `i` is the first element of list `a`, the output state will have `ans` updated based on the XOR operation.
Output State: **`stack` contains the value of `i`, `ans` is updated based on XOR operation between last two elements of `stack`, `i` is the first element of list `a`, and the length of `stack` is greater than 1**
