According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is a non-empty list, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `stack` is an empty list and `ans` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `a` must be a non-empty list, and `i` is the first element of the list `a`.
State: **`stack` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of list `a`**
