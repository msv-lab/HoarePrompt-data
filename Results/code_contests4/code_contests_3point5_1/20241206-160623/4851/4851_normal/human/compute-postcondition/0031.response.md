Example Answer:
The last element of `stack` is removed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` removes the last element, `ans` remains the maximum of the current `ans` and the XOR operation of the last two elements of `stack`, `i` is the next element of list `a`, `stack` is not empty, the length of `stack` is greater than 1, and the last element of `stack` is less than `i` for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` must be less than `i`.
Output State: **`stack` removes the last element, `ans` remains the maximum of the current `ans` and the XOR operation of the last two elements of `stack`, `i` is the next element of list `a`, `stack` is not empty, the length of `stack` is greater than 1, and the last element of `stack` is less than `i` for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` must be less than `i`**
