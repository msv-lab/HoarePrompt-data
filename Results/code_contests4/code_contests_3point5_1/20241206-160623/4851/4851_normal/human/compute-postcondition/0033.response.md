Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the `stack`. Since `i` is the last element of list `a`, it is added to the `stack`. The `ans` remains the maximum of the current `ans` and the XOR operation of the last two elements of `stack`, but the specific values are not given in the initial state. The loop has finished executing. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` contains the last element of list `a`, `ans` remains the maximum of the current `ans` and the XOR operation of the last two elements of `stack`, loop has finished executing.
Output State: **`stack` contains the last element of list `a`, `ans` remains the maximum of the current `ans` and the XOR operation of the last two elements of `stack`, loop has finished executing**
