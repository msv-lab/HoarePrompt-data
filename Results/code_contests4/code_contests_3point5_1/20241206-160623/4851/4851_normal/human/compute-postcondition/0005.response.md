Example Answer: 
The last element of the list `stack` is removed by using the `pop()` function. Since `stack` is a list with one less element than before and is not empty, after executing `stack.pop()`, the list `stack` will have one less element than before. The value of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stack` is a list with one less element than before, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of list `a`, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` is less than `i` and `stack` is not empty.
Output State: **`stack` is a list with one less element than before, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of list `a`, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` is less than `i` and `stack` is not empty**
