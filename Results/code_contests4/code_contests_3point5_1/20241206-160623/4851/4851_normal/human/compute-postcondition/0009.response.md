Example Answer:
The value of variable `i` is appended to the `stack` list. The initial state indicates that `stack` is an empty list and `i` is the first element of list `a`, so after execution, `stack` will contain the value of `i`. The value of `ans` remains 0. 
Output State: **`stack` contains the value of `i`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of list `a`**
