Example Answer:
The last element of `stack` is removed using the `pop()` function. The value of `ans` is updated based on XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`. Since we are only removing the last element and not affecting `ans`, the next `i` is added to `stack`, and the length of `stack` is still greater than 1 for the loop to execute subsequent times.
Output State: **`stack` contains the updated values, `ans` is calculated based on XOR operation, next `i` is added to `stack`, and the length of `stack` is still greater than 1**
