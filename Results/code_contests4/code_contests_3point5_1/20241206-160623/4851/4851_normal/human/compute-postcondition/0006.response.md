According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `stack` and `i`. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` is a list with one less element than before, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of list `a`. For the loop to execute again, the last element of `stack` must be less than `i` and `stack` must not be empty. So, the states that need to be adjusted are: the last element of `stack` should be less than `i` and `stack` should not be empty.
State: **`stack` is a list with one less element than before, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of list `a`, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` is less than `i` and `stack` is not empty**
