#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a):
    stack, ans = [], 0
    for i in a:
        while stack and stack[-1] < i:
            stack.pop()

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` contains the elements of list `a` in non-decreasing order, `ans` is the maximum XOR value of adjacent elements in `stack`, `a` is a list of elements
    return ans
    #The program returns the maximum XOR value of adjacent elements in list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a list 'a' of integers, sorts them in non-decreasing order in a stack, and then calculates the maximum XOR value of adjacent elements in the stack. The function returns this maximum XOR value.
