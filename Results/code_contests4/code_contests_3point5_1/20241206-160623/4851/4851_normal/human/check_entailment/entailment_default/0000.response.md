Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an input list of integers, sorts them in non-decreasing order using a stack, and then calculates the maximum XOR value of adjacent elements in the stack. 
- The function `func_1` correctly follows the problem description by finding the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r].
- The output hints also confirm that the code implementation is correct and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities observed.
