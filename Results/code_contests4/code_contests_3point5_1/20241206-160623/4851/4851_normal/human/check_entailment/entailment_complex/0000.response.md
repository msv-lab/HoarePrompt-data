Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` follows the problem description accurately. It processes the input list of integers to find the maximum lucky number as defined in the problem description. The program sorts the input list in non-decreasing order and then calculates the maximum XOR value of adjacent elements in the sorted list, which corresponds to the lucky number. Therefore, the program is correct and always produces the correct output based on the problem description.
