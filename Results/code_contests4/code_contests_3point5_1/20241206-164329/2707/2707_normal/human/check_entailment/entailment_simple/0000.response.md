Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It sorts the list of wealth values in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the wealthiest `n1` individuals for the first city and the sum of the next wealthiest `n2` individuals for the second city. It then calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth of the cities' residents.

The program ensures that the wealthier individuals are allocated to the first city and the less wealthy individuals to the second city, maximizing the overall sum of arithmetic means of wealth in each city. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
