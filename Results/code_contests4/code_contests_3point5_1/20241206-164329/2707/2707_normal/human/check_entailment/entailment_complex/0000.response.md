The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input, sorts the list of wealth values, calculates the sum of the n1 smallest elements as s1 and the sum of the n2 largest elements as s2, and then prints the average of s1/n1 and s2/n2. The program ensures that n1 and n2 are within the specified range, and handles cases where n1 is greater than n2.

The program calculates the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth of cities' residents as required by the problem description. It covers all potential cases and provides the correct output.
