Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It sorts the list of wealth in ascending order, calculates the sum of the n1 smallest elements as s1 and the sum of the n2 largest elements as s2. Then, it prints the average of s1/n1 and s2/n2. The code also handles the case where n1 is greater than n, ensuring that s1 will be 0 in this scenario. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, confirming that it accurately computes the average of the sums of the specified elements. Since the code meets all requirements and there are no contradicting examples, the correctness is deemed as True.
