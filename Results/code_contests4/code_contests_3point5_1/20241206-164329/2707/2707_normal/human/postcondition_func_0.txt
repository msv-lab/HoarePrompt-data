The function accepts inputs n, n1, n2, and a list of integers. It sorts the list in ascending order and calculates the sum of the n1 smallest elements as s1 and the sum of the n2 largest elements as s2. Then, it prints the average of s1/n1 and s2/n2. If n1 is greater than n, s1 will be 0. The function calculates the average of the sums of the specified elements.
