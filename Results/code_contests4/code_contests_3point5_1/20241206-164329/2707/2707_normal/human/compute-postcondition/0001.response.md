Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The input is taken using `raw_input().split()`. As `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are not used in the code snippet, their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input**
