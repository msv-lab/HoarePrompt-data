According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n1` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n1` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `s1` is assigned the value of the sum of integers in the list `a` starting from the index `n - i - 1`; for the loop to execute a second time `n1` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
