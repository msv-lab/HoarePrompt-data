According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n1`. If `n1` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the loop will execute if `n1` is greater than 0. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `n1` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `s1` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n1` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
