Example Answer: 
`n1` and `n2` are swapped in value. The variables `n1` and `n2` were integers within the specified range, and `n1` was greater than `n2`. After the swap, `n1` now holds the value of the previous `n2`, and `n2` holds the value of the previous `n1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. `n1` is less than `n2`.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. `n1` is less than `n2`**
