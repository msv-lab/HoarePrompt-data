Example Answer:
The value of `s1` is updated by adding the element at index `n - i - 1` from the list `a`. The variables `n`, `n1` are incremented by 1 but their initial values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1` are incremented by 1; `s1` is updated with the sum of integers in list `a` starting from the index `n - i`.
Output State: **`n`, `n1` are incremented by 1; `s1` is updated with the sum of integers in list `a` starting from the index `n - i`**
