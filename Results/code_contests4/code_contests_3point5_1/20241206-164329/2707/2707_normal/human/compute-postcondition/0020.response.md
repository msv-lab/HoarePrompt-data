Example Answer:
The value of `s2` is incremented by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`. The loop will execute one more time as `i` will be increased by 1, given that `i` must be less than `n2`. The previous values of `s2`, `n`, `n1`, `i`, and `n2` are unknown, so the output state is: `s2` is incremented by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`, and `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time with the condition that `i` must be less than `n2`.
Output State: **`s2` is incremented by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time with the condition that `i` must be less than `n2`**
