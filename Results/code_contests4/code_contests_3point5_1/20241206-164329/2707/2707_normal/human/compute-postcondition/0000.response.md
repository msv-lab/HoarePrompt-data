Example Answer:
`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range**
