Output State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `s1` is the sum of integers in the list `a` starting from the index `n - n1 - 1` after all iterations of the loop have finished. If `n1` is greater than `n`, `s1` remains 0; `s2` is the sum of `n2` integers from the list `a` starting from the index `n - n1 - 1`.**
