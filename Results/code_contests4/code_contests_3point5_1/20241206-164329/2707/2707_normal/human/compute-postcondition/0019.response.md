According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n2`. If `i` is less than `n2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s2` is incremented by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1. 
State: **`s2` is incremented by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` will be increased by 1 and must be less than `n2`**
