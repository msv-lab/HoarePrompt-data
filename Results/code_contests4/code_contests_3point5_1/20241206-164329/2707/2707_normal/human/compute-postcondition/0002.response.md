Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, and `n2` are integers within the specified range; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
