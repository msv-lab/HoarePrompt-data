Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values for the number of price tags and the number of items in Valera's list. It then reads the prices of the fruits and the names of the fruits Valera wants to buy. 

The program then calculates the minimum and maximum possible sum that Valera may need to buy all fruits from his list based on the prices of the fruits and the quantities of each fruit he wants to buy. It does so by sorting the prices and the counts of each fruit, and then calculating the total cost for both the minimum and maximum scenarios.

Finally, the program prints the minimum and maximum possible sums as required by the problem description.

The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible sums for Valera's purchases.
