Example Answer:
The value associated with key `nf` in the `buy` dictionary is incremented by 1. The value of `nf` retains its raw input value, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `buy` dictionary updated with the incremented value associated with key `nf`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `nf` retains the raw input value.
Output State: **`buy` dictionary updated with the incremented value associated with key `nf`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `nf` retains the raw input value**
