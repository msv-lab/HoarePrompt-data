According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `buy` is an empty dictionary, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and i is 0.
State: **`buy` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
