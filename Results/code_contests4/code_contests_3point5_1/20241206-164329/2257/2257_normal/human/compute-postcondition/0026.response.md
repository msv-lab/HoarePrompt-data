Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the values of `mini` and `maxi` formatted as integers. The values of `mini` and `maxi` are already calculated and stored in the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `buy` is a dictionary, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the length of `counts`, `nf` retains the value from the last iteration, `counts` is a list of values from `buy` sorted in ascending order, `maxi` is the sum of products of `cs` and `counts` in reverse order, `mini` is the sum of products of `cs` and `counts` in ascending order and the values of `mini` and `maxi` are printed.
Output State: **`buy` is a dictionary, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the length of `counts`, `nf` retains the value from the last iteration, `counts` is a list of values from `buy` sorted in ascending order, `maxi` is the sum of products of `cs` and `counts` in reverse order, `mini` is the sum of products of `cs` and `counts` in ascending order and the values of `mini` and `maxi` are printed**
