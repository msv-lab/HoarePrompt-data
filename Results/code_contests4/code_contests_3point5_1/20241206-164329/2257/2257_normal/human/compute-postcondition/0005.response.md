Example Answer: 
`nf` is assigned the value of the raw input. The `get` method is used to retrieve the value of `nf` from the `buy` dictionary, if it exists. If `nf` does not exist in `buy`, its default value is set to 0. Then, 1 is added to this value and the result is assigned back to `buy[nf]`. Since `nf` was just assigned the raw input value, the `buy` dictionary will now have `nf` as a key with a value of 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `buy` dictionary contains key-value pair where key is the raw input and value is 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `nf` is assigned the value of the raw input.
Output State: **`buy` dictionary contains key-value pair where key is the raw input and value is 1, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `nf` is assigned the value of the raw input**
