#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, i and j are non-negative integers.**
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    if (alen > blen) :
        return '>'
        #The program returns the greater than symbol '>'

        if (alen < blen) :

        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: Postcondition: *a and b are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, i and j are non-negative integers. The length of a is less than or equal to the length of b. The length of a is greater than or equal to the length of b*
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: Postcondition: *a and b are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, i and j are non-negative integers. The length of a is less than or equal to the length of b. The length of a is greater than or equal to the length of b*
    while i < allen and j < bllen:
        if a[i] < b[j]:
            return '<'
        elif a[i] > b[j]:
            return '>'
        
        i += 1
        
        j += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If the loop terminates, it means that either `i` or `j` has reached the respective length limits (`allen` or `bllen`). If `i` reaches `allen` first, it implies that all digits of `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding digits of `b`, hence the return value is '<'. If `j` reaches `bllen` first, it implies that all digits of `a` are greater than or equal to the corresponding digits of `b`, hence the return value is '>'. If neither condition is met, it means that all corresponding digits of `a` and `b` are equal. In that case, the loop ends with `i` and `j` incremented by the same value, and the return value would be '='.
    return '='
    #The program returns '=' indicating that all corresponding digits of 'a' and 'b' are equal
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. It compares the values of `a` and `b` considering their lengths and corresponding digits. The function returns different characters based on the comparison results: 
- If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns '>'.
- If `a` is less than `b`, it returns '<'.
- If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns '='.
- If there is a mismatch in corresponding digits of `a` and `b`, it returns '>'.
- If the loop executes again with 'i' and 'j' within their respective length limits, it returns '<' based on the digit comparison.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to compare the values of `a` and `b` and return the appropriate character based on the comparison results.
