Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to compare the values of `a` and `b` considering their lengths and corresponding digits, and return the appropriate character ('>' if `a` is greater than `b`, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '=' if `a` is equal to `b`). However, the code has some issues:
1. The function `func_1` is not defined before it is used in the print statement. This will result in a NameError.
2. The code does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` have leading zeroes correctly. It only removes leading zeroes at the beginning and compares the remaining numbers. This will lead to incorrect results in the case where both numbers have leading zeroes but are actually equal. For example, for the input "00012345" and "12345", the code will incorrectly output '>' instead of '='.
3. The code does not account for the possibility of one number being longer than the other but having the same value. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where one number is a multiple of 10 of the other number. For example, for the input "0123" and "9", the code will incorrectly output '>' instead of '='.

Therefore, the code does not fully adhere to the problem description and is incorrect.
