Output State: **If the loop terminates, it means that either `i` or `j` has reached the respective length limits (`allen` or `bllen`). If `i` reaches `allen` first, it implies that all digits of `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding digits of `b`, hence the return value is '<'. If `j` reaches `bllen` first, it implies that all digits of `a` are greater than or equal to the corresponding digits of `b`, hence the return value is '>'. If neither condition is met, it means that all corresponding digits of `a` and `b` are equal. In that case, the loop ends with `i` and `j` incremented by the same value, and the return value would be '='.**
