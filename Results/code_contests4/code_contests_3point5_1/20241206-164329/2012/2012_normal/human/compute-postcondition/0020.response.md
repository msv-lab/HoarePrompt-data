Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is an integer, `j` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `allen` and `j` must be less than `bllen` after the increment. If `a[i]` is less than `b[j]`, the program returns the string '<'. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]', the program returns the character '>'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
