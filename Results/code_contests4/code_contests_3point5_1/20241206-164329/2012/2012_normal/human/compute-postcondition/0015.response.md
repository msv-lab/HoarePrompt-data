According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `allen`, `j`, and `bllen`. If `i` is less than `allen` and `j` is less than `bllen`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` should be less than `bllen` after being increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `allen` and `j` is less than `bllen` after being increased by 1**
