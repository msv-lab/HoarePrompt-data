According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `allen` and `j` must be less than `bllen` after the increment. Additionally, if `a[i]` is less than `b[j]`, the program returns '<'. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]', the program returns '>'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is an integer and increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `allen` and `j` must be less than `bllen` after the increment**
