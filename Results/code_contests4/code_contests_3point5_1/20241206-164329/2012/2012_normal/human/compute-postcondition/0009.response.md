Postcondition: ***a and b are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, i and j are non-negative integers. The length of a is less than or equal to the length of b. The length of a is greater than or equal to the length of b, for the loop to execute the first time i is less than allen, j is less than bllen, and the length of a is greater than the length of b. The value of a[i] is greater than or equal to b[j]***
