Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. It compares the values of `a` and `b` considering their lengths and corresponding digits. The function returns different characters based on the comparison results: 
- If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns '>'.
- If `a` is less than `b`, it returns '<'.
- If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns '='.
- If there is a mismatch in corresponding digits of `a` and `b`, it returns '>'.
- If the loop executes again with 'i' and 'j' within their respective length limits, it returns '<' based on the digit comparison.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to compare the values of `a` and `b` and return the appropriate character based on the comparison results.**
