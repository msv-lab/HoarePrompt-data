The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. The parameters `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, while `i` and `j` are non-negative integers. After executing the function body, the program will return different characters based on the comparison of the values of `a` and `b` as follows:

- Case 1: If `a` is greater than `b`, the program returns the greater than symbol '>'
- Case 2: If `a` is less than `b`, the program returns the '<' character
- Case 3: If `a` is equal to `b`, the program returns the '<' character
- Case 4: If `a` is not equal to `b`, the program returns '>'
- Case 5: If the loop executes again with the condition that 'i' is less than 'allen' and 'j' is less than 'bllen' after being increased by 1, the program returns the string '<'
- Case 6: If `a` is greater than `b`, the program returns the '>' character
- Case 7: If `a` is less than `b`, the program returns the '<' character
- Case 8: If `a` is not equal to `b`, the program returns the '>' character
- Case 9: If all corresponding digits of 'a' and 'b' are equal, the program returns '=' indicating equality between the two numbers

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`, and return different characters based on the comparison of `a` and `b` as described in the cases above.
