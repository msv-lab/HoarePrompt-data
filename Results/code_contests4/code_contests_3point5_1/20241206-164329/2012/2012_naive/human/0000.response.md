Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b.
- It removes any leading zeroes from both integers.
- It compares the lengths of the two integers and returns the appropriate symbol "<", ">", or "=" based on their lengths.
- If the lengths are equal, it iterates through the digits of both integers and compares them to determine which one is greater.
- It prints the correct symbol based on the comparison result.
- The logic of the program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
