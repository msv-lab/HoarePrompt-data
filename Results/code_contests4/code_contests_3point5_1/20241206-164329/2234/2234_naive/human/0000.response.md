Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program first reads the input strings and counts how many times each string appears as a substring in the other strings. Then, it checks if there is more than one string that appears only once as a substring in the other strings. If there is, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to reorder the strings in the required order. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the strings in the required order. The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, ensuring that each string is a substring of all strings that come after it.
