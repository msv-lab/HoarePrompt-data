According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c1`. If `c1` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c1` is assigned the count of occurrences of the first element of list `ls` in the variable `x[0]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `c1` must be greater than 0 after the previous iteration.
State: **`c1` is assigned the count of occurrences of the first element of list `ls` in the variable `x[0]`, for the loop to execute one more time `c1` must be greater than 0**
