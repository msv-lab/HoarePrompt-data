According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sorted_x`. If `sorted_x` is an iterable object, the loop can execute. Since the program simply prints 'YES', there is no specific state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
State: **All variables remain the same for the loop to execute**
