Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by 1, so if `t` was initially `x`, after execution, `t` becomes `x - 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is `x - 1`, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user with an additional string `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is `x - 1`, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user with an additional string `a`**
