Example Answer:
The string entered by the user is stored in variable `a` using `raw_input()`. The loop is not explicitly mentioned, so the program does not iterate. The previous values of the variables are `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user, `a` contains the string entered by the user.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user, `a` contains the string entered by the user**
