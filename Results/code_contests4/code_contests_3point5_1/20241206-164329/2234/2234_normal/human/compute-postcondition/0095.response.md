According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `c1` and `sorted_x`. If `c1` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c1` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `sorted_x` must have more than one element.
State: **`c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `sorted_x` must have more than one element**
