According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `c1`. If `c1` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `c1` is assigned the count of occurrences of the first element of list `ls` in the variable `x[0]` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `c1` is greater than 0. 
State: **`c1` is assigned the count of occurrences of the first element of list `ls` in the variable `x[0]`, for the loop to execute `c1` is greater than 0**
