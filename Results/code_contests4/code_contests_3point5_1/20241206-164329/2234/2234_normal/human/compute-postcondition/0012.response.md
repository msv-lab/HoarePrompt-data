Example Answer:
The string `a` is appended to the list `ls`. The length of `ls` increases by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user with an additional string `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user with an additional string `a`**
