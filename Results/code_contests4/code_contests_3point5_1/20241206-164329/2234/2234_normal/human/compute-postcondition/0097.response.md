According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `c1` and `sorted_x`. If `sorted_x` has at least 2 elements and `c1` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. Before the loop starts, `c1` is the count of `x[0] in `ls` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, and `sorted_x` has more than one element.
State: **`c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `sorted_x` has more than one element for the loop to execute one more time**
