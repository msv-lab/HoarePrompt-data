Example Answer:
`ls` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. `t` is an input integer. `ls` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, inclusive. `t` is an input integer. `ls` is an empty list**
