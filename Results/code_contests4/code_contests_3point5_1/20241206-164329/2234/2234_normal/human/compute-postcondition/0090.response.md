According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c1`. If `c1` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c1` is greater than 0. Since the loop increments `z` by 1 each time, for the loop to execute one more time, `c1` must still be greater than 0.
State: **`c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `c1` must be greater than 0**
