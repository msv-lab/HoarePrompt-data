Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `ls` contains at least one string, `x` is the last string in ls, `a` is the last string in ls, `t` is 0, `dict1` is a dictionary with keys as the strings in ls and the values as the total count of each string in ls, `count` is the total number of strings in ls that contain x, `z` is the last string in ls, `x` is in z, `sorted_x` is not empty and has more items in it, `c2` is the total number of items in sorted_x where the value is 1. If c2 is greater than 1, `NO` is printed. Otherwise, all elements in list ls are printed out based on their counts in sorted_x.***
