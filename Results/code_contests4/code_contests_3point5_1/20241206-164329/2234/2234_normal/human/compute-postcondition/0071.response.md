Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `ls` contains at least one string. `x` is the last string in `ls`. `a` is the last string in `ls`. `t` is 0. `dict1` is a dictionary with keys as the strings in `ls` and the values as the total count of each string in `ls`. `count` is the total number of strings in `ls` that contain `x`. `z` is the last string in `ls`. `x` is in `z`. `sorted_x` is not empty and has more items in it. `c2` is 1 if `item[1]` is equal to 1. After the execution of the if else block, `c2` is incremented by 1.***
