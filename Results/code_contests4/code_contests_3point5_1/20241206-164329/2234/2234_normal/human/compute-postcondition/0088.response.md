According to the code, the loop can execute as long as c1 is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the condition for the loop to execute is that c1 must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that c1 is greater than 0.
State: **`c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `c1` must be greater than 0**
