Example Answer:
The string `a` entered by the user is appended to the list `ls`. The loop will execute again only if `t` is greater than 0. The variables `n` and the length of strings remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user, `a` is a string entered by the user, for the loop to execute again `t` should be greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user, `a` is a string entered by the user, for the loop to execute again `t` should be greater than 0**
