According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `c1` and `z`. If `z` is less than `c1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 2. Since z is increased by 1 in the for loop statement, for the loop to execute one more time `z` should be 3.
State: **`c1` is greater than 0, `z` is 3, `sorted_x` has more than one element, and the first element of `x` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time `z` should be 3**
