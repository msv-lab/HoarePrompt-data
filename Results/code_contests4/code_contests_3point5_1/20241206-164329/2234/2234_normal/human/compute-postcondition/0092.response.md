According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c1`. If `z` is less than `c1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c1` is greater than 0. Since `z` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be less than the updated `c1`.
State: **`c1` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `c1` must be greater than 1**
