According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `ls` is an empty list**
