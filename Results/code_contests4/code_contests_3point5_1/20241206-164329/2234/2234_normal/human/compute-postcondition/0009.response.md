Example Answer:
`t` is decremented by 1. The value of `t` can be any integer between 0 and 99 as it is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user, `a` is a string entered by the user, for the loop to execute again `t` should be greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the strings entered by the user, `a` is a string entered by the user, for the loop to execute again `t` should be greater than 0**
