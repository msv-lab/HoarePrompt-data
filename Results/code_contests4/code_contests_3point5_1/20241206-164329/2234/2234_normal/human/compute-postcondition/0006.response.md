According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the new value of `t` should be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the string entered by the user, `a` is a string entered by the user, for the loop to execute again `t` should be greater than 0**
