Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `t` is unknown, but it is mentioned that `t` is an input integer greater than 0, so after execution, `t` will be reduced by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 decreased by 1, `ls` contains the string entered by the user, `a` is a string entered by the user.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the string entered by the user, `a` is a string entered by the user**
