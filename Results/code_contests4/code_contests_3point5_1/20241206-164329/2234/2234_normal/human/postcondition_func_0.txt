The function `func` reads an integer `t`, then reads `t` strings of lowercase English letters. It then creates a dictionary where each string is a key and the value is the total count of that string in the list. It checks if there is only one unique count in the dictionary and prints 'YES' if true, or 'NO' if false. If 'YES' is printed, it then prints out the strings based on their counts in descending order. The function does not explicitly return any value.
