Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input strings, creates a dictionary with the count of each string, checks if there is only one unique count, and then prints the strings in the required order if possible. The logic ensures that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. This meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
