Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description. The code checks if there is only one unique count of each string in the list and prints 'YES' if true, or 'NO' if false. However, this logic does not guarantee that all strings placed before another string are substrings of that string. For example, in the case where strings "abacaba" and "aba" are given, the code will output 'YES' even though "abacaba" is not a substring of "aba". This violates the requirement of the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as required and is considered incorrect.
