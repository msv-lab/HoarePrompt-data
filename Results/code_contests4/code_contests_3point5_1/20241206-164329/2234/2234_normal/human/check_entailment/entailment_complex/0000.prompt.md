You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given n strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.

String a is a substring of string b if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in b in such a way that they form a. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of strings.

The next n lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from 1 to 100, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.

Some strings might be equal.

Output

If it is impossible to reorder n given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and n given strings in required order.

Examples

Input

5
a
aba
abacaba
ba
aba


Output

YES
a
ba
aba
aba
abacaba


Input

5
a
abacaba
ba
aba
abab


Output

NO


Input

3
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty


Output

YES
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty

Note

In the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string "abab" is not a substring of the string "abacaba".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, inclusive.**
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    ls = []
    while t > 0:
        a = raw_input()
        
        ls.append(a)
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, each of the n strings consists of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `ls` contains all the strings entered by the user, `a` is the last string entered by the user
    dict1 = {}
    for x in ls:
        count = 0
        
        for z in ls:
            if x in z:
                count = count + 1
        
        dict1[x] = count
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `ls` contains at least one string, `x` is the last string in `ls`, `a` is the last string in `ls`, `t` is 0, `dict1` is a dictionary with keys as the strings in `ls` and the values as the total count of each string in `ls`, `count` is the total number of strings in `ls` that contain `x`, `z` is the last string in `ls`, `x` is in `z`
    sorted_x = sorted(dict1.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
    sorted_x.reverse()
    c2 = 0
    for item in sorted_x:
        if item[1] == 1:
            c2 = c2 + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `ls` contains at least one string, `x` is the last string in `ls`, `a` is the last string in `ls`, `t` is 0, `dict1` is a dictionary with keys as the strings in `ls` and the values as the total count of each string in `ls`, `count` is the total number of strings in `ls` that contain `x`, `z` is the last string in `ls`, `x` is in `z`, `sorted_x` is not empty and has more items in it, `c2` is the total number of items in `sorted_x` where the value is 1.
    if (c2 > 1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        for x in sorted_x:
            c1 = ls.count(x[0])
            
            for z in range(c1):
                print(x[0])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in list `ls` are printed out based on their counts in `sorted_x`
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is greater than 0, `ls` contains at least one string, `x` is the last string in ls, `a` is the last string in ls, `t` is 0, `dict1` is a dictionary with keys as the strings in ls and the values as the total count of each string in ls, `count` is the total number of strings in ls that contain x, `z` is the last string in ls, `x` is in z, `sorted_x` is not empty and has more items in it, `c2` is the total number of items in sorted_x where the value is 1. If c2 is greater than 1, `NO` is printed. Otherwise, all elements in list ls are printed out based on their counts in sorted_x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t`, then reads `t` strings of lowercase English letters. It then creates a dictionary where each string is a key and the value is the total count of that string in the list. It checks if there is only one unique count in the dictionary and prints 'YES' if true, or 'NO' if false. If 'YES' is printed, it then prints out the strings based on their counts in descending order. The function does not explicitly return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
