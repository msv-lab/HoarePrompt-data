Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes input of `n` strings, counts the number of times each string is a substring of other strings, sorts them based on the count, and then prints the rearranged strings if it is possible to do so. If it is not possible to reorder the strings, it prints "NO".

The program ensures that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings, as required by the problem description.
