Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads the input strings, counts the number of occurrences of each string as a substring in other strings, sorts them in descending order by count, and then prints the strings in the required order. The program correctly follows the problem description by rearranging the strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the output meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
