Based on the provided code and the problem description, let's analyze if the program is correct:

The code takes three integers r, g, and b as input, representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It then calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner, where each table should have exactly three balloons with different colors.

Let's first analyze the program based on the code and the problem description:
- The code sorts the input values in ascending order and assigns the smallest value to r.
- It then calculates the number of tables that can be decorated based on the available balloons of each color.
- The code seems to handle the cases where each color of balloon is available in sufficient quantity to decorate multiple tables with the required condition.
- The logic appears to correctly determine the maximum number of tables that can be decorated given the available balloons.

Next, let's check if the output hints agree with the code:
- The output hints do not provide specific test cases or edge cases that the code might not handle.
- The hints do not mention any particular scenarios that the code should cover apart from the general problem description.

Based on the analysis:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with the available balloons. It processes the input values appropriately and calculates the number of tables considering the constraints provided in the problem description. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, and there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the hints that the code fails to address. Therefore, the code is deemed correct.
