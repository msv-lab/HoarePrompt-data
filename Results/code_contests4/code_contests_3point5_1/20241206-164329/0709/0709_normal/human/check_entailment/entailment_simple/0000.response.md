Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with the given number of red, green, and blue balloons. It follows the logic described in the problem description where it finds the minimum number of balloons of one color, then distributes the remaining balloons evenly among the other colors to form sets of three different colored balloons for each table. The program also handles cases where there are different numbers of remaining balloons of different colors to determine the maximum number of tables that can be decorated.
