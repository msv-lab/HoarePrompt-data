The function `func_2` operates on three non-negative integers `r`, `g`, and `b` such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. It does not accept any parameters and performs some operations or calculations with these integers. The function then prints the results to a stream or `sys.stdout` by default. The function handles the formatting of the output by using the provided `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` keyword arguments. The state of the program after execution involves the modification of variables based on these arguments.
