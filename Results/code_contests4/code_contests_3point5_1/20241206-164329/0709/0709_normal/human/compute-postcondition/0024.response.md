The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It operates on three non-negative integers `r`, `g`, and `b` such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9. The function does some operations or calculations with these three integers and returns a certain output based on the result of these operations. The functionality of the function `func_2` involves processing the values of `r`, `g`, and `b` without taking any input parameters and returning a specific output based on the result of these operations.
