Since the loop is iterating over `args`, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one element in `args`. Before the loop starts, `at_start` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `args` is a non-empty iterable and `x` is the first element in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`**
