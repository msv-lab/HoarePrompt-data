Example Answer:
The code does not affect any variables in the initial state. It is a docstring that explains the purpose of the function but does not change any values. Therefore, the Output State is: r, g, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9.
Output State: **r, g, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9.**
