Example Answer:
The code snippet is attempting to pop the values associated with the keys 'sep' and 'file' from the dictionary kwargs. If these keys exist in kwargs, their values are assigned to sep and file respectively, otherwise, the default values ' ' and sys.stdout are used. Since there is no information given about the kwargs dictionary initially, we can't determine the exact values of sep and file after the code execution. Therefore, the Output State is: r, g, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9.
Output State: **r, g, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9.**
