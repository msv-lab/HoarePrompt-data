Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the file. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is False. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `at_start` is False**
