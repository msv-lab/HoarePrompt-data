Example Answer:
The value of `x` is written to the file as a string. The value of `at_start` remains False. Since no new variables are introduced or affected, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`at_start` remains False, `args` still has more elements, `x` is the next element in `args`, and `at_start` is still False after writing the value of the new `x` to the file.**
