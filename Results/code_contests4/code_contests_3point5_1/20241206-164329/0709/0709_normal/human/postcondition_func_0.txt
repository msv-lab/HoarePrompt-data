The function `func_1` internally processes three non-negative integers `r`, `g`, and `b`. It sorts these integers and performs a series of calculations on them to determine a final value `t`. The function then calls another function `func_2` with the calculated value `t`. However, the annotations do not provide a clear insight into the exact purpose or outcome of these calculations. It seems to involve manipulation of the input values `r`, `g`, and `b` to generate the final value `t`, but the exact logic and purpose of this transformation remain ambiguous due to the lack of detailed explanation in the annotations.
