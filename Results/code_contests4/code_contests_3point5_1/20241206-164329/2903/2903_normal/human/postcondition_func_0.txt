The function `func` reads input values for n, k, s, and mn, as well as a list of integers a. It then iterates through the list a, updating the values of s and mn based on certain conditions. The function calculates the minimum value between mn and s after the loop completes and prints the result. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but operates on the predefined inputs.
