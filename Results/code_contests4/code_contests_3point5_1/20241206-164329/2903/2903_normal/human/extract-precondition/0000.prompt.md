You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A lot of frogs want to cross a river. A river is w units width, but frogs can only jump l units long, where l < w. Frogs can also jump on lengths shorter than l. but can't jump longer. Hopefully, there are some stones in the river to help them.

The stones are located at integer distances from the banks. There are a_i stones at the distance of i units from the bank the frogs are currently at. Each stone can only be used once by one frog, after that it drowns in the water.

What is the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river, given that then can only jump on the stones?

Input

The first line contains two integers w and l (1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5) — the width of the river and the maximum length of a frog's jump.

The second line contains w - 1 integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{w-1} (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), where a_i is the number of stones at the distance i from the bank the frogs are currently at.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.

Examples

Input

10 5
0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0


Output

3


Input

10 3
1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1


Output

3

Note

In the first sample two frogs can use the different stones at the distance 5, and one frog can use the stones at the distances 3 and then 8.

In the second sample although there are two stones at the distance 5, that does not help. The three paths are: 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 10, 0 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 10, 0 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 10.
Function definition:
```
