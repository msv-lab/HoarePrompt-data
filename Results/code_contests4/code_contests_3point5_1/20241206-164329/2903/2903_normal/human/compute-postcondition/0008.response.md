Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are integers with specific values, `a` is a list of integers. If `i < k`, then `s` is incremented by the value at index `i` of list `a`. Otherwise, the loop continues with `i` being incremented by 1, and `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`.***
