Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are integers with specific values, `a` is a list of integers. The loop will update `s` and `mn` based on the conditions specified in the loop code for all iterations of the loop. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `s` will be the sum of specific elements in list `a`, and `mn` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the specific calculations performed within the loop.**
