Example Answer:
The list `a` is created by mapping the `int` function to each element of the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n, k, s, and mn have been assigned specific integer values; `a` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **n, k, s, and mn have been assigned specific integer values; `a` is a list of integers created from the input**
