Example Answer:
The value of `mn` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `mn` and `s`. Since `mn` is a specific integer value and `s` is also a specific integer value, `mn` will be updated to the minimum of these two values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are specific integer values, `a` is a list of integers. The loop executes with `i` being 0 and `n` being 2 or greater. `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`.
