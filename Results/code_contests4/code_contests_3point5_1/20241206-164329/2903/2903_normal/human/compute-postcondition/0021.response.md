The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on predefined parameters w, l, and the list of stones a_i. The constraints state that w and l are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, and the list of stones a_i contains w - 1 integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^4. Therefore, the function operates on these predefined parameters to perform some computation or processing. The return value of the function will depend on the specific functionality implemented within the function, which is not specified in the given information.
