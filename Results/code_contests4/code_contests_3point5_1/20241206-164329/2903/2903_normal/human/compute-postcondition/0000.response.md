Example Answer:
`n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are assigned values from the result of mapping `int` to the input split with additional values [0, 10000000000]. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are determined by the input and additional values provided. Therefore, the Output State is: n, k, s, and mn have been assigned specific integer values.
Output State: **n, k, s, and mn have been assigned specific integer values**
