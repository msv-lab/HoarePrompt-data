Example Answer:
Initially, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are integers with specific values, `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is incremented by 1. When `s += a[i]` is executed, `s` is incremented by the value at index `i` of list `a`. If `i < k`, this operation takes place, otherwise, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn` are integers with specific values, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, and the operation `s += a[i]` is executed accordingly.**
