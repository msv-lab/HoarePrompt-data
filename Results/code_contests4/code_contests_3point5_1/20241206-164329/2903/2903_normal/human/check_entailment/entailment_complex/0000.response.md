Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input values for the width of the river, the maximum length of a frog's jump, the list of stones, and then iterates through the stones updating the values of `s` and `mn` based on the conditions specified in the problem description. At the end of the loop, it calculates the minimum value between `mn` and `s` and prints the result, which is the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river using the stones.

The program follows the problem description accurately by considering the distances of the stones from the banks and ensuring that each stone can only be used once by one frog. The conditions in the loop update the values of `s` and `mn` correctly based on the distances of the stones and the maximum length of a frog's jump, ultimately calculating the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.
