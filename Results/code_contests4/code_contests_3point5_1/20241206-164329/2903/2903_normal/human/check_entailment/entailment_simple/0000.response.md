Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river based on the given constraints. It iterates through the list of stones and updates the sum `s` and the minimum value `mn` according to the conditions specified in the problem description. The final output is the minimum value between `mn` and `s`, which represents the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river using the available stones. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
