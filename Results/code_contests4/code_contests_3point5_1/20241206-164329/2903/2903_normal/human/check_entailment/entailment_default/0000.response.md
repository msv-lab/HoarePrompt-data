Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not exactly follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem states that frogs can only jump on stones, but the code does not consider the limitation of frogs jumping only on stones. Additionally, the code does not calculate the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river, which is the main requirement of the problem. Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the problem description.

Output hints do not provide any additional information to validate the correctness of the code as they focus on the input reading and updating values within the loop, rather than the main objective of the problem.
