Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river by using the stones. It iterates through the stones and keeps track of the cumulative distance covered by frogs. It considers the case where the frog can jump to a stone within its jump limit and updates the minimum distance accordingly. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases, it provides the correct output.
