Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the program is correctly calculating the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river based on the given constraints. The code iterates through the list of stones and calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river by considering the distances and the maximum length of a frog's jump.

The program takes into account the positions of the stones and updates the minimum number of stones required to cross the river. It correctly handles the case where the frog can jump on the stones and calculates the maximum number of frogs accordingly.

Overall, the code seems to be logically correct and aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. Hence, the correctness of the program is considered True.
