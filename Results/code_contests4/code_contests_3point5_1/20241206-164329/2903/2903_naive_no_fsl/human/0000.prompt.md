You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A lot of frogs want to cross a river. A river is w units width, but frogs can only jump l units long, where l < w. Frogs can also jump on lengths shorter than l. but can't jump longer. Hopefully, there are some stones in the river to help them.

The stones are located at integer distances from the banks. There are a_i stones at the distance of i units from the bank the frogs are currently at. Each stone can only be used once by one frog, after that it drowns in the water.

What is the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river, given that then can only jump on the stones?

Input

The first line contains two integers w and l (1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5) — the width of the river and the maximum length of a frog's jump.

The second line contains w - 1 integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{w-1} (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), where a_i is the number of stones at the distance i from the bank the frogs are currently at.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.

Examples

Input

10 5
0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0


Output

3


Input

10 3
1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1


Output

3

Note

In the first sample two frogs can use the different stones at the distance 5, and one frog can use the stones at the distances 3 and then 8.

In the second sample although there are two stones at the distance 5, that does not help. The three paths are: 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 10, 0 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 10, 0 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 10.
Program:
```
(n, k, s, mn) = map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])
a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if i < k:
        s += a[i]
    else:
        mn = min(mn, s)
        s += a[i] - a[i - k]
print(min(mn, s))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
