Example Answer:
The lambda function `f` is defined to accept input, split it, convert each element to an integer, and return a list of integers. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a lambda function that converts input to a list of integers.
Output State: **`f` is a lambda function that converts input to a list of integers**
