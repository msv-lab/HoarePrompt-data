Example Answer:
The lambda function f is applied M times to the list [0] * M, resulting in a list of tuples. The zip function then groups the elements of these tuples into separate lists, which are unpacked into variables a, b, and c. Since the initial state of N, M, and R are not provided, we cannot determine their values after executing this code.
Output State: **Unable to determine the values of N, M, and R after executing the code**
