Example Answer:
`N, M, R` are assigned the values returned by the lambda function `f()`, which converts input to a list of integers. The specific values of `N`, `M`, and `R` are unknown without knowing the input values or the implementation of the lambda function. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a lambda function that converts input to a list of integers, `N`, `M`, `R` are assigned values returned by `f()`.
Output State: **`f` is a lambda function that converts input to a list of integers, `N`, `M`, `R` are assigned values returned by `f()`**
