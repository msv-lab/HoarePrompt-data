Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input for the number of towns, roads, and towns to visit.
- It then reads the road lengths and calculates the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- The code then generates permutations of the visited towns and calculates the minimum sum of distances between points based on these permutations.
- Finally, it prints the minimum sum of distances, which is the distance traveled by road if Joisino visits the towns in the order that minimizes it.

The code seems to be following the problem description accurately, as it correctly calculates the minimum distance traveled by road based on the order of visiting the towns. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code's functionality, providing further confirmation of its correctness.
