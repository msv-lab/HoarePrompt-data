Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, constructs a graph using the input data, calculates the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, and then calculates the minimum sum of distances between points based on permutations of the visited towns.

The program outputs the correct result for all possible cases as it follows the specified algorithm to find the minimum distance traveled by road when visiting the towns in the order that minimizes it.
