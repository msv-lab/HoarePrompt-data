Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for N, M, R, r, a, b, and c.
- It then calculates the shortest distance between all pairs of towns using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Finally, it finds the minimum distance traveled by road when Joisino visits the towns in the order that minimizes it by iterating through all permutations of the towns she visits.
- Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given examples, we can conclude that the program is correct.
