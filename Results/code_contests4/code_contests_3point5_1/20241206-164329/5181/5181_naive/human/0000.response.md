Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the good string that can be obtained. The correct formula to calculate the length of the longest good string should be `a + b + min(a, b) + 2 * c`, but the program in the code snippet incorrectly adds `a + b` and then tries to add `2 * c` separately. 

For example, if the input is `2 1 2`, the correct output should be `7` (as the longest good string can be "abababa"), but the program will output `5` which is incorrect.
