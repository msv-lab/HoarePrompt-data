Example Answer:
`a, b, c` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts an input and splits it, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split element to an integer. The values of `a, b, c` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a, b, c` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are assigned integer values based on the input**
