#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(a + b) + 2 * c
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three integers from the user input, adds the first two integers, and calculates the sum plus twice the third integer. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
