Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program simply calculates `a + b` and then adds `2 * c` to the result, but this does not guarantee the maximum length of a good string that can be obtained by concatenating the given strings.

For example, if we take the input `2 1 2`, the correct output should be `7` as the optimal string is "abababa". However, the program's output would be `5` because it calculates `2 + 1` first and then adds `2 * 2` to the result.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct result as it does not follow the requirements of the problem description.
