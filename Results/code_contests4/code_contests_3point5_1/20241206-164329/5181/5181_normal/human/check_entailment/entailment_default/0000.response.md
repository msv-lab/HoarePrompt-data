Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three integers as input, representing the number of strings "a", "b", and "ab" respectively. It then calculates the maximum possible length of a good string that can be obtained by concatenating these strings in any order. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It adds the first two integers and then adds twice the third integer to calculate the maximum length of the good string. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description, and the provided examples also validate the correctness of the code. Therefore, the code is correct for all cases.
