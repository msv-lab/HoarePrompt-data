Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible length of a good string that can be obtained by concatenating the given strings "a", "b", and "ab". It first reads the input values for "a", "b", and "c" and then calculates the maximum length by adding "a" and "b" and then adding twice the value of "c". This logic covers all possible cases and will always give the correct output based on the problem description.
