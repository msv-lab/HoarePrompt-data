Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement. It first calculates the lowbit value for each integer from 1 to n, then constructs a list of tuples containing the lowbit value and the integer itself. It then sorts this list based on the lowbit value and selects integers from the list until the target sum is reached.

The program handles all cases where it is possible to find a suitable set S that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description. It also correctly outputs -1 if it's impossible to find a suitable set.

Overall, the program logic is correct and it covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
