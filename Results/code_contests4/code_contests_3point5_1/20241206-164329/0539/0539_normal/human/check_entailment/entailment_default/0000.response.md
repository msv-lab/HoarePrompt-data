Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input values for target and n, then iterates through a loop to calculate values based on conditions involving bitwise operations and logarithmic calculations. After sorting the calculated values, it selects elements from the list A until the sum of the first elements reaches the target value or exceeds it. Finally, it prints the number of selected elements and their corresponding values. The code seems to follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases mentioned. The output hints also align with the code functionality and provide a clear explanation of how the code works. Therefore, the code is correct.
