Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It generates a set S that satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem description. It calculates the lowbit values for each integer from 1 to n, adds them to the set S until the sum reaches the target value. The program then prints the size of the set and the elements of the set in any order. It also handles the case where it's impossible to find a suitable set by printing -1. The program output matches the expected output based on the problem description for all possible cases.
