Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input values for target and n, calculates values based on the conditions involving bitwise operations and logarithmic calculations, sorts the calculated values, selects elements from the list A until the sum of the first elements reaches the target value or exceeds it, and finally prints the number of selected elements and their corresponding values.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for in all potential cases.
