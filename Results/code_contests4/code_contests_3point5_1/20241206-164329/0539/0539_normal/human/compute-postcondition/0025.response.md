Example Answer: 
The code `exit()` immediately terminates the program, so no further changes occur to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list containing tuples of the form (2, s), s is less than target.
Output State: **A is a list containing tuples of the form (2, s), s is less than target**
