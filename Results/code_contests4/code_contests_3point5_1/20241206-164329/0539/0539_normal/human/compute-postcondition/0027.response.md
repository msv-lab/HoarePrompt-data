Example Answer:
The list A containing tuples of the form (2, s) is sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each tuple. As the initial state mentions that s is less than target, the sorting operation will arrange the tuples in increasing order of s values. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list containing sorted tuples of the form (2, s) in ascending order of s values.
Output State: **A is a list containing sorted tuples of the form (2, s) in ascending order of s values**
