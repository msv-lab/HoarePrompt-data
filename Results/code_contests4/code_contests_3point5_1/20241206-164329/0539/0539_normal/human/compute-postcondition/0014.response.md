Example Answer: 
A is a list containing tuples of the form (2, s is updated based on the first element of the last tuple in list A, for the loop to execute again n must be greater than the current value of i; k is assigned the value of the base-2 logarithm of i if i is not equal to 1 and k is equal to i - 1. After executing the code, a new tuple (2 ** k, i) is appended to list A. The value of k depends on the value of i, so the new tuple will have different values based on the conditions specified for k. Therefore, the Output State is: A is updated with a new tuple based on the conditions for k.
Output State: **A is updated with a new tuple based on the conditions for k**
