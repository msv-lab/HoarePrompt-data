Example Answer:
The code snippet iterates through the list A and adds the values of s from the tuples in A to the list 'selected' until the sum of the first elements of the tuples in A is greater than or equal to the initial value of target. After all iterations, the value of target becomes less than or equal to 0. Finally, the length of 'selected' is printed. The values of A, selected, and target are modified during the execution.
Output State: **A is a list containing sorted tuples of the form (2, s) in ascending order of s values, selected is a list containing the values of s from the tuples in list A until the sum of the first elements of the tuples in A is greater than or equal to the initial value of target, target is less than or equal to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished and the length of 'selected' is printed.**
