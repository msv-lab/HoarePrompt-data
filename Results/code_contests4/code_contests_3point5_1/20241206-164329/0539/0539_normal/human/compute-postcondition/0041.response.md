Example Answer:
The value of `target` is decreased by the first element of the tuple `tup`, which is 2 in this case. Since `target` was initially decreased by 4, it is further decreased by 2, resulting in `target` being decreased by a total of 6. For the loop to execute one more time, `target` needs to be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list containing sorted tuples of the form (2, s) in ascending order of s values, selected is a list containing the value of s from the first tuple in list A, target is decreased by 6 and for the loop to execute one more time, target is greater than 0.
Output State: **A is a list containing sorted tuples of the form (2, s) in ascending order of s values, selected is a list containing the value of s from the first tuple in list A, target is decreased by 6 and for the loop to execute one more time, target is greater than 0**
