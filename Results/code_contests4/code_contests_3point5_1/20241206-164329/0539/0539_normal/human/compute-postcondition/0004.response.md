Example Answer:
The value of `k` is calculated as `(i & -i) - 1`, where `&` is the bitwise AND operator. Given that `i` is 1, `-i` is -1 in two's complement form. Therefore, `i & -i` results in 1 (0001 & 1111 = 0001). Finally, `k = 1 - 1 = 0`. Since the values of other variables are not affected, the Output State is: `A` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0.
Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0**
