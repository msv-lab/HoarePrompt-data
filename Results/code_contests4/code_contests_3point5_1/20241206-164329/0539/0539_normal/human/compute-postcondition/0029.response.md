According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list A. If A has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, selected is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed, the list A must have at least 1 tuple, and tup is the first tuple in the list A.
State: **A is a list containing sorted tuples of the form (2, s) in ascending order of s values, selected is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time tup is the first tuple in list A**
