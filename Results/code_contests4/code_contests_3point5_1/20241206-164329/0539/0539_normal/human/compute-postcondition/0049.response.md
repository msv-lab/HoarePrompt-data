Functionality: **The function reads input values for target and n, then iterates through a loop to calculate values based on conditions involving bitwise operations and logarithmic calculations. After sorting the calculated values, it selects elements from the list A until the sum of the first elements reaches the target value or exceeds it. Finally, it prints the number of selected elements and their corresponding values.**
