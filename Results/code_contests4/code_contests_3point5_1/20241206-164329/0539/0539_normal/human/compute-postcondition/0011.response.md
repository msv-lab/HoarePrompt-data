Example Answer:
`k` is calculated as `(i & -i) - 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so the calculation of `k` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list containing tuples of the form (2, `s` is updated based on the first element of the last tuple in list `A`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`.
Output State: **`A` is a list containing tuples of the form (2, `s` is updated based on the first element of the last tuple in list `A`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`**
