Example Answer:
target and n are assigned values by splitting the input. The values are taken from the input and separated by a space. The variables target and n will now hold the respective values. Therefore, the Output State is: sum and limit are integers such that 1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 105; target and n are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **sum and limit are integers such that 1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 105; target and n are assigned values from the input.**
