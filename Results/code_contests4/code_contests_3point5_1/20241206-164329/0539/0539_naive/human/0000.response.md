Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes the input values for sum and limit.
- It then iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to n.
- For each number, it calculates the value of k using the bitwise operation (i & -i) - 1.
- If the number is not 1 and k is equal to i - 1, it recalculates k using int(math.log(i, 2)).
- It appends the tuple (2 ** k, i) to the list A and calculates the sum of the elements.
- If the sum is less than the target, it prints -1 and exits.
- Otherwise, it sorts the list A and iterates over it to find the selected elements that add up to the target.
- Finally, it prints the size of the selected list and the elements themselves.

The program follows the problem description and correctly identifies a suitable set S that satisfies all the given conditions. It handles all potential cases and prints the correct output.
