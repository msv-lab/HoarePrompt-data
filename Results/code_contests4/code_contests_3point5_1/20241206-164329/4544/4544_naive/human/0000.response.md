Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input in the specified format and iterates through each participant to find the winner with the most fish caught. It compares the number of fish caught by each participant and if there are multiple winners, it selects the one with the lowest participant number. The output format also matches the description given in the problem statement. Additionally, the program exits after printing the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught, as required. The logic is sound and handles all potential cases correctly.
