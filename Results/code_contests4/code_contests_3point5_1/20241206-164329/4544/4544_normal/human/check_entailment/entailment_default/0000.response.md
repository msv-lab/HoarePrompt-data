Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the input values for the number of participants, participant numbers, and the number of fish caught by each participant. It then iterates through the participants, finding the participant with the highest number of fish caught. Finally, it prints out the participant number and the corresponding highest number of fish caught. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly determines the winner based on the number of fish caught. The program outputs the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught as expected. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle.
