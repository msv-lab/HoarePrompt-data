Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the first integer value returned by `readline().split()`, and `v` is assigned the second integer value returned by `readline().split()`. The values of `a` and `v` are dependent on the input provided by `readline()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of participants, each `ai` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, each `vi` is a non-negative integer, `a` is assigned a value from input, `v` is assigned a value from input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of participants, each `ai` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, each `vi` is a non-negative integer, `a` is assigned a value from input, `v` is assigned a value from input**
