Example Answer:
`value` is assigned the value of `v`, where `v` is taken as an input. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of participants, each `ai` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, each `vi` is a non-negative integer, `a` is assigned a value from input, `v` is assigned a value from input. If `v` is greater than `value` or if `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number`, then the program state satisfies the condition, `number` is assigned the value of `a`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of participants, each `ai` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, each `vi` is a non-negative integer, `a` is assigned a value from input, `v` is assigned a value from input. If `v` is greater than `value` or if `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number`, then the program state satisfies the condition, `number` is assigned the value of `a`**
