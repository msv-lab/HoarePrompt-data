Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `v`, `number`, `value` are positive integers. If `v` is greater than `value` or if `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number`, then the loop executes again with the updated values of `number` and `value`. `a`, `v` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input split by space. `number` is assigned the value of `a`. `value` is assigned the value of `v`.***
