Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of participants, each `ai` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, each `vi` is a non-negative integer, `a` is assigned a value from input, `v` is assigned a value from input. If `v` is greater than `value` or if `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number`, then the program state satisfies the condition***
