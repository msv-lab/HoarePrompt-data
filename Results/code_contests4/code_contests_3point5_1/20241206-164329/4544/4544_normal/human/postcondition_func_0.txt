The function `func_1` reads input values for the number of participants (n), participant numbers (ai), and the number of fish caught by each participant (vi) based on certain constraints. It then iterates through the participants, finding the participant with the highest number of fish caught. Finally, it prints out the participant number and the corresponding highest number of fish caught. There is no specific output mentioned in the description.
