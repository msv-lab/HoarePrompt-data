Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of books that can be read within the given time constraint. It iterates through both Desk A and Desk B, reading books based on the time it takes to read each book. It considers all possible cases where the total time taken to read books does not exceed the given limit. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the maximum number of books that can be read is calculated accurately. The program accounts for all possible scenarios and provides the correct output for the given input.
