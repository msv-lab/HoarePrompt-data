Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of books that can be read within the given time constraint by iterating through the books on each desk and choosing the one that takes the least time to read until the total time exceeds the limit. The program considers all cases and edge cases specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for each example. Additionally, the program uses appropriate data structures and logic to handle the input and perform the required calculations.
