The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns an empty list if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function generates a list 'r' containing all prime numbers between 2 and n (inclusive). The code initializes a list of boolean values to track prime numbers and then populates 'r' with the prime numbers based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The function handles edge cases of `n` being less than 2 by returning an empty list.
