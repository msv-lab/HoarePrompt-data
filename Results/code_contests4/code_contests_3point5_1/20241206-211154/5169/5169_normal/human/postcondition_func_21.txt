The function `func_22` implicitly accepts input values N, M, K, A_i, and B_i as integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B, the total time limit in minutes, and the time to read each book on each desk, respectively. The function iterates through the books on both desks, adding the time to read each book to the total time if it does not exceed the time limit. If the total time exceeds the limit, it stops reading books from that desk. The function then prints the count of books read within the time limit from both desks. If the loop breaks due to the total time exceeding the limit, it prints the count at that point. The function does not explicitly return a value.
