You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K

        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `mod` and calculates two lists, 'fact' and 'ifact', based on loop iterations from 1 to 200004. The 'fact' list stores values calculated incrementally in the loop, and the 'ifact' list is updated according to a specific formula within the loop code. The function returns these lists after the loop execution.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    """ returns N inverse modulo p """
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `p`. It calculates the inverse of `n` modulo `p` by raising `n` to the power of `(p - 2)` modulo `p` and returns the result. The function assumes `n` and `p` are integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    """ takes 4 arguments: n , r and factorial and inverse factorial lists"""
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % MOD % MOD

''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts four parameters `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`, all of which are positive integers. It calculates a value `t` based on the factorial and inverse factorial lists provided, and returns this calculated value. The function performs a multiplication operation and applies modulo operations. It ensures that the final result is within the range of MOD.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(Sum):
    """this function returns the maximum n for which Summation(n) <= Sum"""
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * Sum)) // 2
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_4` calculates the maximum value of an integer `n` for which the summation of numbers from 1 to `n` is less than or equal to the input parameter `Sum`. It uses a formula involving the square root function and integer operations to compute this value and returns it as `ans`. The function operates based on the assumption that `Sum` is the result of specific calculations involving positive integers N, M, K, A_i, and B_i. It does not handle cases where `Sum` is a negative number, and it assumes that the input `Sum` is a valid result to compute the maximum `n`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:

    for p in range(3, n + 1, 2):
        if prime[p]:
            r.append(p)
    return r
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns an empty list if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function generates a list 'r' containing all prime numbers between 2 and n (inclusive). The code initializes a list of boolean values to track prime numbers and then populates 'r' with the prime numbers based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The function handles edge cases of `n` being less than 2 by returning an empty list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n, start=1):
    """ returns a list of all divisors till n """
    divisors = []
    for i in range(start, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):

''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n` and `start`, which are integers. It then calculates and returns a list of divisors of `n` that satisfy certain conditions specified in the loop code. The conditions are related to the maximum total time in minutes and the time in minutes to read each book on desk A and B. The code handles cases where the divisors are equal or not equal, and ensures that all valid divisors are included in the final list.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''

        while n % i == 0:
            t += 1
            n //= i
        divs_number *= t
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `primes`, where `n` is a positive integer and `primes` is a list of prime numbers. The function calculates the number of divisors of `n` based on the prime factors provided in the `primes` list. The calculation involves finding the highest power of each prime factor that divides `n` and multiplying these powers together. The function returns this final calculated value.

    if left == -1:
        return (default, default)
    else:
        return (left, right)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function `func_8` takes three parameters: a list of integers `d`, an integer `x`, and an integer `default`. It then searches for the first and last occurrences of `x` in the list `d`. If `x` is not found in `d`, the function returns the values of `default` and `default`. If `x` is present in `d`, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` as 'left' and the index of the last occurrence of `x` as 'right'.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    """ returns greatest common divisor of x and y """

 Output decription for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y` after all iterations of the loop have executed. The function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. No missing functionality or edge cases are present in the code based on the provided annotations.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a):
    """ returns True/False """
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:

    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of positive integers. It iterates through the elements of the list and checks if they are in non-decreasing order. If at any point during the iteration, it finds that the elements are not in non-decreasing order, the function immediately returns False. If all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order after the loop executes without returning False, the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_10` is to accept a list of positive integers and return True if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. If any element breaks the non-decreasing order, it returns False.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n, k=1):
    return n // k + (n % k != 0)
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the result of integer division of `n` by `k` and adds 1 to the result if the remainder of `n` divided by `k` is not zero. The function performs the division accurately as described in the annotations. There are no missing edge cases or functionalities in this function.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string from the standard input and removes any leading or trailing whitespaces before returning the string.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    return int(func_12())
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  Functionality: The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters. It returns the integer value of the result of executing the function `func_12()`. However, the annotation mentions that N, M, and K are positive integers, and A_i and B_i are positive integers for 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= i <= M. This information seems to be irrelevant as the function does not use or interact with these variables in any way. Additionally, the annotation does not mention what happens if `func_12` returns a non-integer value, which could lead to a potential edge case where the conversion to an integer may fail.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    return map(int, func_12().split())
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function func_14 does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing integers after applying the int function to the result of splitting the output of func_12(). The code splits the output of func_12() and converts the resulting elements to integers within the map object.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    return list(map(int, func_12().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses the function `func_12` to process some input and then converts the result to a list of integers. The resulting list of integers is returned by the function.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    return func_12().split()
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_12` and returns the result of `func_12` split into a list. The function does not handle any edge cases or missing functionality beyond this.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // func_9(a, b)
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function func_17 accepts two integer parameters a and b, calculates the absolute value of their product divided by the result of the function func_9(a, b), and returns the final result. However, there are potential edge cases and missing logic in the annotations:
- The annotations specify the preconditions but do not mention the input constraints for func_9(a, b).
- If func_9(a, b) encounters any errors or exceptions, they are not handled or accounted for in the annotations.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18(a, sep=' ', end='\n'):
    print(sep.join(map(str, a)), end=end)
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function `func_18` accepts three integer parameters: `a`, `sep`, and `end`. It then prints the elements of `a` joined by the `sep` string with the `end` string at the end. The function does not have a return value. The code ensures that the parameters `a`, `sep`, and `end` are within the specified constraints.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    return defaultdict(int)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It returns a defaultdict with a default value set to 0. The function always returns a defaultdict with the default value of 0, regardless of the initial state or inputs mentioned in the annotations.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20():
    return defaultdict(list)
''' 

 Output decription for function20:  The function func_20 does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined positive integers N, M, and K, as well as positive integers A_i and B_i for 1 <= i <= N, M. After execution, it returns a defaultdict that contains lists as values.
Function number 21 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_21(s):
    return sys.stdout.write(s)
''' 

 Output decription for function21:  The function func_21 accepts a parameter `s`, writes the value of the string `s` to the standard output (console) using sys.stdout.write.

The function iterates through the books on both desks, adding the time to read each book to the total time if it does not exceed the time limit. If the total time exceeds the limit, it stops reading books from that desk. The function then prints the count of books read within the time limit from both desks. If the loop breaks due to the total time exceeding the limit, it prints the count at that point. The function does not explicitly return a value.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
