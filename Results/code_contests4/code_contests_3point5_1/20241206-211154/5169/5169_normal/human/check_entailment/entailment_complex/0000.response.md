Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the annotations, it appears that the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The functions are appropriately defined and utilized within the main function `func_22`. The logic within the main function correctly reads books from Desk A and Desk B, ensuring that the total time spent reading does not exceed the given limit K. The final count of books read within the time limit is accurately determined and printed. Additionally, the input constraints and variable ranges specified in the annotations are consistent with the problem description. Since no discrepancies or missing functionalities have been identified, the code is deemed correct.
