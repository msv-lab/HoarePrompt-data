Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `check`, `n`, `m` are all integers. `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is the sum of its previous value and `a[ptr1]`, `check` is True, `count` is increased by 1, `n` and `m` are both greater than 0. The value of `a[ptr1]` is less than the value of `b[ptr2]`. The sum of `totaltime` and `a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
