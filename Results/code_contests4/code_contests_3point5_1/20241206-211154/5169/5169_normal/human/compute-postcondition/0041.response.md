Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, then ptr1 is increased by 1, ptr2 is 0, totaltime is incremented by the value of a at index ptr1, check is True, n and m are both integers, and count is increased by 1. Otherwise, ptr1 is set to 0, ptr2 is 0, totaltime is 0, check is False, count is 0, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k, then `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. `ptr1` and `totaltime` are 0. `ptr2` is a positive integer less than `m`. `totaltime` is updated by adding the value of `b[ptr2]`. `count` is increased by 1. If totaltime + b[ptr2] > k, then `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is False, `count` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
