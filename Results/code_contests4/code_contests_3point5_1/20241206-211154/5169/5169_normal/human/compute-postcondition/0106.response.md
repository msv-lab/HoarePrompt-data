Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If `totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k`, then count is incremented by 1 and the loop executes again with `ptr2` less than `m`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k` is False, then `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` are False, count is incremented by 1, and the loop executes again with `ptr2` less than `m`. If `totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k` is False and we enter the else part, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
