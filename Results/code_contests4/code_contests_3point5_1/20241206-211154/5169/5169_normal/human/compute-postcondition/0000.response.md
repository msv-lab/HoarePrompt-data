Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_14()`. The function `func_14()` is assumed to return three integers. Therefore, after execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold those integer values.
Output State: **N and M are integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B respectively. K is an integer representing the total time limit in minutes.**
