Example Answer:
`totaltime` is incremented by the value of `b` at index `ptr2`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`**
