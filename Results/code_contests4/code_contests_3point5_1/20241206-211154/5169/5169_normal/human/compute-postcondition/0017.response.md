Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. `ptr1` is increased by 1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise `ptr1` is set to 0. `ptr2` is set to 0 in both cases. `totaltime` is the sum of its previous value and a[ptr1] if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise totaltime is 0. `check` is True if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise check is False. `count` is increased by 1 if totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, otherwise count is set to 0. `n` and `m` are both greater than 0. The value of `a[ptr1]` is less than the value of `b[ptr2]`. If the sum of totaltime and a[ptr1] is greater than k, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
