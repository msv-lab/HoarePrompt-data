Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If `totaltime` + `b[ptr2]` <= `k`, then `ptr2` is updated with a new value and the sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`. If `totaltime` + `b[ptr2]` > `k`, then `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` are set to False, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers and the loop or if statement is exited.***
