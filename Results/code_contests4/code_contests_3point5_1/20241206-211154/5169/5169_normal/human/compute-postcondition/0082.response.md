Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If `totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k`, `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `count` is incremented by 1, and the loop may continue. Otherwise, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged; the loop will not execute further due to the `break` statement; `ptr1` is still less than `n`, and `check` remains False.***
