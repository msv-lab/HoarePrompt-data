Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. Initially, `ptr1` and `ptr2` are both 0. `totaltime` is 0. `check` is True. `count` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` and `m` are both greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `ptr1` needs to be less than `n` and `ptr2` needs to be less than `m`. If totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k, then `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. `ptr1` and `totaltime` are 0. `ptr2` is a positive integer less than `m`. `totaltime` is updated by adding the value of `b[ptr2]`. `count` is increased by 1. If totaltime + b[ptr2] > k, then `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is False, `count` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
