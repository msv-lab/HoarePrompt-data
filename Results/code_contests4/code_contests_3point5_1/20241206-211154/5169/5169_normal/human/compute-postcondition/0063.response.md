Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `check`, `count+1`, `n`, `m` are integers, `totaltime` is updated to include the value at index `ptr1` of list `a`, the loop has finished without `check` being set to False. The sum of `totaltime` and the value at index `ptr1` of list `a` is less than or equal to `k`**
