Example Answer:
`ptr2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ptr2` is unknown, so after execution, `ptr2` will be increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1`, `ptr2` are integers, `totaltime`, `check` are integers, `count` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2` are integers, `totaltime`, `check` are integers, `count` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`**
