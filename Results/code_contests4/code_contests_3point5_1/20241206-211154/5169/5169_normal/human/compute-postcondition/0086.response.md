Example Answer:
The value of `totaltime` is increased by `b[ptr2]`. Since `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` are integers and their sum is less than or equal to `k`, the new value of `totaltime` will be the previous value of `totaltime` plus the value of `b[ptr2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2`, `totaltime` is updated with the new value, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. The sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
