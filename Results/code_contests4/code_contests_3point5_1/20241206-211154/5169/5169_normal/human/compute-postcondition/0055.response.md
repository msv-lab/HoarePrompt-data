Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If a[ptr1] < b[ptr2] and totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, then `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count` are incremented by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `check` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, and `ptr1` is incremented by 1. If totaltime + a[ptr1] > k, check is set to False and the loop breaks. If a[ptr1] >= b[ptr2] and totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k, `ptr1`, `totaltime`, `check`, and `count` remain the same, `ptr2` is increased by 1, `n`, and `m` remain the same. If totaltime + b[ptr2] > k, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, and `check` is assigned the boolean value False.***
