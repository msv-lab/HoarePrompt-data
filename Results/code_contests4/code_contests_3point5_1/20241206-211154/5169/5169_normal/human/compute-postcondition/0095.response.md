Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated, `check`, `count` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated, `check`, `count` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers**
