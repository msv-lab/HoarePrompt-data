Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is either 0 or 1, `totaltime` is either 0 or updated, `check` is either True or False, `count` is either 0 or 1, `n` and `m` are both greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists. If the totaltime plus the element at index `ptr2` of list `b` is less than or equal to k, then `ptr2` is updated to 1 and the totaltime is adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, `ptr1` remains at 0, `ptr2` is set to 0, `totaltime` is reset to 0, `check` is set to False, `count` is 0, and we exit the loop or if statement.***
