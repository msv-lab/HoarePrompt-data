Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count + 1`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr1` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count + 1`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr1` is less than `n`**
