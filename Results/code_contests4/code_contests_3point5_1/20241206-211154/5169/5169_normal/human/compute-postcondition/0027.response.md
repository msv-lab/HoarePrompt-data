Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. Initially, `ptr1` and `ptr2` are both 0. `totaltime` is 0. `check` is True. `count` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` and `m` are both greater than 0. If `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]`, then `ptr1` is updated based on totaltime and a[ptr1], `ptr2` is set to 0, `totaltime` is adjusted based on a[ptr1] and totaltime, `check` is updated accordingly, and `count` is increased if conditions are met. If `a[ptr1] >= b[ptr2]`, then `ptr1` is reset to 0, `ptr2` is either set to 0 or 1 based on the totaltime and b[ptr2], `totaltime` is reset or adjusted based on the element at index `ptr2` of list `b`, `check` is updated, `count` is reset or increased, and the loop or if statement is exited as necessary.***
