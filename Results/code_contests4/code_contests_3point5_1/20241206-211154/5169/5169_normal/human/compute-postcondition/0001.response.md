Example Answer:
The function `func_15()` is called and assigned to variable `a`. The impact of `func_15()` on the program depends on the specific implementation of the function and the initial state of the program variables. Since we do not have information about the implementation of `func_15()` or the initial values of N, M, and K, we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **The output state cannot be determined without additional information.**
