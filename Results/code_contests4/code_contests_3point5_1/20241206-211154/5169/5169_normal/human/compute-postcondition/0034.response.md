Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, then ptr1 is increased by 1, ptr2 is 0, totaltime is incremented by the value of a at index ptr1, check is True, n and m are both integers, and count is increased by 1. Otherwise, ptr1 is set to 0, ptr2 is 0, totaltime is 0, check is False, count is 0, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
