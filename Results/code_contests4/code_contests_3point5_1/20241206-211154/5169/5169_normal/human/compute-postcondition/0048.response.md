Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned in the code. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, then `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime` are incremented by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `check`, `count` are incremented by 1, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, and `ptr1` is incremented by 1. If totaltime + a[ptr1] > k, then check is set to False and the loop breaks.***
