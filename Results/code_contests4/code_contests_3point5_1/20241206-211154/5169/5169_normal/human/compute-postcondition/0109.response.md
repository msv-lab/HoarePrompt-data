Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If `check` is False, the loop breaks and the final value of `count` is printed. If `check` is True, then `ptr1` is less than or equal to `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` contains the sum of elements in `b` up to a certain index, `check` is True if all `b` elements can be added to `totaltime` without exceeding `k`, `count` is the number of elements added to `totaltime`.***
