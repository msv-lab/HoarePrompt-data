Example Answer:
`check` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr1` is less than `n`; `check` is False.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr1` is less than `n`; `check` is False**
