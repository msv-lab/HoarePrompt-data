Example Answer:
The value of `ptr1` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime` is incremented by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `check`, `count` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m` remain unchanged. After the execution, the new value of `ptr1` will be one more than its previous value.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime` is incremented by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `check`, `count` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, `ptr1` is incremented by 1**
