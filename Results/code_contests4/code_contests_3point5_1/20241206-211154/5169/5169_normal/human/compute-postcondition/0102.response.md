Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` will have increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count` have been modified.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` are integers, `count` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`**
