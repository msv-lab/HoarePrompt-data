Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If totaltime + b[ptr2] is less than or equal to k, then ptr1 is less than n, ptr2 is less than m, totaltime is updated, check and count are integers. Otherwise, if totaltime + b[ptr2] is greater than k, then ptr1 is less than n, ptr2 is less than m, totaltime, count, n, and m are integers, check is False, and the loop or if statement is exited.***
