Example Answer:
The variable `check` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not impact the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` is False, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. The sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` is False, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. The sum of `totaltime` and `b[ptr2]` is greater than `k`**
