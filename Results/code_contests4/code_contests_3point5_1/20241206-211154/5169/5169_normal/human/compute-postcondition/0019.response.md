Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is less than or equal to k, `check` is True, `count` is 0, `n` and `m` are both greater than 0, a and b are lists. The element at index `ptr1` of list `a` is greater or equal to the element at index `ptr2` of list `b`. The sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr2` of list `b` is less than or equal to k***
