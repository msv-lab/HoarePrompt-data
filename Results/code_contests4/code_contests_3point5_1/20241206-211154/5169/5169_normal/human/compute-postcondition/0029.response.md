Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are all integers. Initially, `ptr1` and `ptr2` are both 0. `totaltime` is incremented by the value of `a` at index `ptr1`. `check` is True. `count` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` and `m` are both greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `ptr1` needs to be less than `n` and `ptr2` needs to be less than `m`.**
