Example Answer:
`check` is assigned the value `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` is False, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check` is False, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`**
