According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ptr2`. If `ptr2` is less than `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, no changes are needed as `ptr2` is the only variable determining the loop execution.
State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers**
