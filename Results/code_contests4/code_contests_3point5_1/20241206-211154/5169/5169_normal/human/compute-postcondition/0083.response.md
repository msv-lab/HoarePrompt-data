Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If `totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k` for all `ptr1` less than `n`, then `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `check` is not set to False, `totaltime` contains the sum of `a` elements up to index `n-1`, `count` is the number of elements added to `totaltime`, `ptr2` remains unchanged**
