Example Answer:
`check` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, `check` is `False`.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, `check` is `False`**
