The function `func_22` does not accept any parameters explicitly. Instead, it implicitly accepts the input values N, M, K, A_i, and B_i as described in the parameter constraints. N and M represent the number of books on Desk A and Desk B respectively, K represents the total time limit in minutes, and A_i and B_i represent the time in minutes to read the i-th book on Desk A and Desk B respectively. All input values are integers.

The function `func_22` does not explicitly return a value. The function is expected to perform some calculations or operations based on the input parameters N, M, K, A_i, and B_i to determine the optimal way to read books from Desk A and Desk B within the given time limit K. The exact functionality of the function, in terms of the specific calculations or operations it performs, is not explicitly defined in the given information.
