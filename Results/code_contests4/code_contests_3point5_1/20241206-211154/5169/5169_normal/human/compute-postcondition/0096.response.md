Example Answer:
`ptr2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ptr2` is less than `m`, so after execution, `ptr2` is still less than `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated, `check`, `count` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated, `check`, `count` is an integer, `n` and `m` are integers**
