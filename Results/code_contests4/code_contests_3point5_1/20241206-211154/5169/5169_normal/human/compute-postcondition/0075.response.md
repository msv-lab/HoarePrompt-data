Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count + 1` remain integers, and for the loop to execute again `ptr1` is less than `n`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is greater than `k`, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, `ptr1` is less than `n`, `check` is False. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
