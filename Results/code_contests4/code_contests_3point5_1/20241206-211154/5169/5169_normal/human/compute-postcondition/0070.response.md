Example Answer:
The value at index `ptr1` in the array `a` is added to `totaltime`. The previous values of variables are not provided, so the output state is: `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr1` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr1` is less than `n`**
