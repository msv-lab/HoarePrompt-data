According to the code, the loop can execute again if `ptr2` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `ptr2` is less than `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` is less than `m`**
