Example Answer:
The value at index `ptr2` of list `b` is added to `totaltime`. The previous values of variables are known, so the updated value of `totaltime` depends on the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers**
