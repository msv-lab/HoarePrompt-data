Postcondition: ***`ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. If the sum of `totaltime` and the value at index `ptr1` of list `a` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ptr1` is incremented by 1, `ptr2`, `check`, `count+1`, `n`, `m` are integers, and `totaltime` is updated to include the value at index `ptr1` of list `a`. The loop has finished without `check` being set to False. If the sum of `totaltime` and the value at index `ptr1` of list `a` is greater than `k`, then `ptr1`, `ptr2`, `totaltime`, `check`, `count`, `n`, `m` are integers. The loop has finished without `check` being set to False. `check` is set to False.***
