The function func_17 accepts two integer parameters a and b, calculates the absolute value of their product divided by the result of the function func_9(a, b), and returns the final result. However, there are potential edge cases and missing logic in the annotations:
- The annotations specify the preconditions but do not mention the input constraints for func_9(a, b).
- If func_9(a, b) encounters any errors or exceptions, they are not handled or accounted for in the annotations.
