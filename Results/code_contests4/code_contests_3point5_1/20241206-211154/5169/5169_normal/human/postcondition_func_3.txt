The function `func_4` calculates the maximum value of an integer `n` for which the summation of numbers from 1 to `n` is less than or equal to the input parameter `Sum`. It uses a formula involving the square root function and integer operations to compute this value and returns it as `ans`. The function operates based on the assumption that `Sum` is the result of specific calculations involving positive integers N, M, K, A_i, and B_i. It does not handle cases where `Sum` is a negative number, and it assumes that the input `Sum` is a valid result to compute the maximum `n`.
