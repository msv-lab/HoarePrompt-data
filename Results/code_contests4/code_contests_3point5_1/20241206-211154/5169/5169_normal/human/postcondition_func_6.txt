The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `primes`, where `n` is a positive integer and `primes` is a list of prime numbers. The function calculates the number of divisors of `n` based on the prime factors provided in the `primes` list. The calculation involves finding the highest power of each prime factor that divides `n` and multiplying these powers together. The function returns this final calculated value.
