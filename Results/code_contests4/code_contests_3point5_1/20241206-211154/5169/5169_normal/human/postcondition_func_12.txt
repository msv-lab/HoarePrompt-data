Functionality: The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters. It returns the integer value of the result of executing the function `func_12()`. However, the annotation mentions that N, M, and K are positive integers, and A_i and B_i are positive integers for 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= i <= M. This information seems to be irrelevant as the function does not use or interact with these variables in any way. Additionally, the annotation does not mention what happens if `func_12` returns a non-integer value, which could lead to a potential edge case where the conversion to an integer may fail.
