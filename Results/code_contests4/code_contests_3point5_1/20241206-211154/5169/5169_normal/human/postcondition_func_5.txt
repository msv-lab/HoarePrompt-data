The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n` and `start`, which are integers. It then calculates and returns a list of divisors of `n` that satisfy certain conditions specified in the loop code. The conditions are related to the maximum total time in minutes and the time in minutes to read each book on desk A and B. The code handles cases where the divisors are equal or not equal, and ensures that all valid divisors are included in the final list.
