The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `mod` and calculates two lists, 'fact' and 'ifact', based on loop iterations from 1 to 200004. The 'fact' list stores values calculated incrementally in the loop, and the 'ifact' list is updated according to a specific formula within the loop code. The function returns these lists after the loop execution.
