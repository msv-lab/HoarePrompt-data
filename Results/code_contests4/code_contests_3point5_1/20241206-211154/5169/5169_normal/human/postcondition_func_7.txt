The function `func_8` takes three parameters: a list of integers `d`, an integer `x`, and an integer `default`. It then searches for the first and last occurrences of `x` in the list `d`. If `x` is not found in `d`, the function returns the values of `default` and `default`. If `x` is present in `d`, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` as 'left' and the index of the last occurrence of `x` as 'right'.
