The function `func_9` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y` after all iterations of the loop have executed. The function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. No missing functionality or edge cases are present in the code based on the provided annotations.
