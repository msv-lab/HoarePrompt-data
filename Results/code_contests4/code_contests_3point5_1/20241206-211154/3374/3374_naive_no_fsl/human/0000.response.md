Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct. The issue lies in the calculation of the final sum. The `func_2` function is not called to output the sum calculated based on the given conditions. As a result, the program does not provide the correct output according to the problem description.

Additionally, the program is missing a critical step where the robot iterates over the elements of the array and checks if the current element is divisible by x to add x copies of the integer q/x to the end of the array. This logic is not implemented in the program, further deviating from the problem description.

Therefore, the program needs to be modified to include the correct logic for iterating over the array elements, checking divisibility by x, and calculating the final sum based on the described conditions.
