Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the sum of all values in the array at the end of the process. The issue lies in the calculation of the `min_idx` variable in the `func_1` function. The correct calculation should be `min_idx = pow_x.index(min_pow) + 1` to include the element at the `min_idx` position in the sum. However, the program incorrectly calculates the sum by excluding the element at the `min_idx` position. This results in an incorrect output for the sum of values in the array.
