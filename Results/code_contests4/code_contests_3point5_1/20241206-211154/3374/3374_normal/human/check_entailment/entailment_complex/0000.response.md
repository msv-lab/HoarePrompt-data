Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is that the code does not correctly implement the robot's behavior as described in the problem. The robot should add x copies of the integer q/x to the end of the array if q is divisible by x, but the code does not perform this correctly. The function `func_1` only calculates the minimum power of x that each element in the array can be divided by and then calls `func_2` with a specific parameter for each test case. This means that the actual behavior of the robot adding x copies of q/x is not implemented in the code. 

Therefore, since the core functionality of the robot is missing in the code, the correctness of the program is **False**.
