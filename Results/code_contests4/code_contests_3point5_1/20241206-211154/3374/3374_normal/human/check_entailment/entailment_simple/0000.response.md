Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the problem description. 

The main issue lies in the func_1 function where the logic for updating the array based on the robot's behavior is incorrect. The program calculates the minimum power of x for each element in the array, but it fails to correctly update the array with the new elements created by the robot. 

The formula `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])` used to calculate the sum of all values at the end of the process is incorrect. This formula does not take into account the correct multiplication factor for each element that is divisible by x. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
