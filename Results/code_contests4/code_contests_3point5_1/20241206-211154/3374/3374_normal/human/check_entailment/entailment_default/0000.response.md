After reviewing the provided code and the problem description, along with the output hints, I have come to the conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The output hints do not align with the code in the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function reads the input data for multiple test cases, calculates the minimum power of `x` that each element in the array can be divided by, finds the minimum power value, and calls another function `func_2` with a specific parameter for each test case. However, the `func_2` function does not seem to handle the main algorithm described in the problem statement. The output hints for `func_1` mention processing and forwarding test case data to `func_2` based on given constraints, but the actual implementation in `func_2` does not seem to perform the necessary calculations to solve the problem.

2. The `func_2` function does not seem to contain the logic to handle the iteration over the elements of the array, checking divisibility by `x`, and adding copies of the integer `q/x` to the end of the array. It seems to be a generic output function that may not be suitable for solving the specific problem described.

Given these discrepancies between the code implementation and the problem description, along with the lack of relevant logic in the functions provided, the correctness of the code is deemed to be false.
