**Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array, x is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, and a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are positive integers representing the initial values in the array.**
