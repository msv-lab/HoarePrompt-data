Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split. The variable `t` is decremented by 1, but its previous value is not known. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables retain their previous values, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split.
Output State: **All variables retain their previous values, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split.**
