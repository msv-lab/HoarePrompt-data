According to the code, the loop will execute again if `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ai` is divisible by `x`, and `ai` is updated to its integer division by `x`. To execute the loop again, the value of `ai` needs to be divisible by `x` after being updated. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ai` is divisible by `x` and updated to its integer division by `x` for the loop to execute again**
