Output State: `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, `ai` is updated by floor division with `x` multiple times for each element in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times each `ai` was successfully divided by `x`, and `pow_x[i]` is assigned the final value of `cnt` after all iterations for each element in `a`. `min_pow` is assigned the minimum value within the list `pow_x`. `min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value `min_pow` in the list `pow_x`.
