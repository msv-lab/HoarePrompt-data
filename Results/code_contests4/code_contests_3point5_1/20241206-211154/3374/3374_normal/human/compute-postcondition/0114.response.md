According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `ai % x == 0`. Right before the loop, `ai` is the last element in list `a`, and it must be divisible by `x` for the loop to execute. Therefore, you need to adjust the state such that the last element `ai` in list `a` is divisible by `x`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`t` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `n` and `x` remain the same, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros except for the position `i` which is assigned the value of `cnt`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed plus 1, `ai` is the last element in the list `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times the loop incremented by 1, `ai` is the last value after all divisions by `x`, `cnt` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `ai` is divisible by `x`**
