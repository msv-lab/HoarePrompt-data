Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data for multiple test cases where each case consists of an array `a`, the length of the array `n`, and an integer `x`. It then calculates the minimum power of `x` that each element in the array can be divided by, finds the minimum power value, and calls another function `func_2` with a specific parameter for each test case. The function does not have any explicit return value, and its purpose seems to be processing and forwarding test case data to `func_2` based on given constraints.**
