According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` is the result of floor division of `ai` by `x`, `i` has been updated to `i+1`, `ai` has been assigned the new value from list `a`, `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and `pow_x[i]` has been updated with the new value of `cnt`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `ai` needs to be updated to the new value from list `a`
- `i` needs to be updated to `i+1`
- `cnt` needs to be incremented by 1
- `pow_x[i]` needs to be updated with the new value of `cnt`

State: **`ai` is the new value from list `a`, `i` is updated to `i+1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `pow_x[i]` is updated with the new value of `cnt`**
