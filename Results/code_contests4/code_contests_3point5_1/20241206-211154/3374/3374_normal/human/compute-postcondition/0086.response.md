According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was updated by floor division with `x` multiple times and the final value of `cnt` was assigned to `pow_x[i]`, which is 2. This indicates that `ai` was successfully divided by `x` at least twice. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must be divisible by `x` with no remainder. Therefore, `ai` should be adjusted to be divisible by `x` with no remainder in the next iteration.
State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is updated by floor division with `x` multiple times, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was successfully divided by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is assigned the final value of `cnt` after all iterations, `cnt` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` must be divisible by `x` with no remainder, `ai` is repeatedly floor divided by `x` and for the loop to execute again `ai` must be divisible by `x` with no remainder**
