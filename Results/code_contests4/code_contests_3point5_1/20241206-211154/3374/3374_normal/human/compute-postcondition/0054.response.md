According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. If `ai % x` is equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, and `x` is assigned from the input. For the loop to execute the first time, `ai` must be divisible by `x`, so `ai % x` should be 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` is divisible by `x`**
