According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. Right before the loop, `ai` is updated, `x` is assigned, and `ai % x == 0` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Additionally, `cnt` is 0, and `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ai % x` should be 0, and `pow_x[i]` should be updated to the value of `cnt`.
State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ai` is updated, `cnt` is 0, `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`, and for the loop to execute one more time `ai % x == 0` and `pow_x[i]` is updated to the value of `cnt`**
