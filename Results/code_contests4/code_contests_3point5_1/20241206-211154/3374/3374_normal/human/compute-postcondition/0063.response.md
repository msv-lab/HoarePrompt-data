Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is updated to the final integer division result after all iterations, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` in all iterations of the loop.**
