Example Answer:
The `pop` method removes and returns the value of the 'end' key from the `kwargs` dictionary. If 'end' key is not present, it returns '\n' by default. The `write` method writes this value to the file. Since `kwargs` is not provided in the initial state, the `pop` method will raise a `KeyError`. Therefore, the program will raise an exception and stop execution. The output state will be the program terminates with a KeyError.
Output State: **The program terminates with a KeyError**
