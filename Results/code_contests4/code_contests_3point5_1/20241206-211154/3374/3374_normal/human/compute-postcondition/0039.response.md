According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. If `ai` satisfies this condition, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is the next element in list `a` after floor division by `x`. For the loop to execute again, `ai` after performing floor division by `x` must still satisfy the condition. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ai` after performing floor division by `x`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is updated after performing floor division by `x` to satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`.**
