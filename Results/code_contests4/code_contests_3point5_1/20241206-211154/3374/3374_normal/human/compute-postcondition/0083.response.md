According to the code, the loop will execute again if `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was successfully divided by `x` multiple times, so `ai % x` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `ai` should still be divisible by `x` with no remainder. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is updated by floor division with `x` multiple times, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was successfully divided by `x`, `pow_x[i]` is assigned the final value of `cnt` after all iterations, `cnt` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` must be divisible by `x` with no remainder, `ai` is repeatedly floor divided by `x`**
