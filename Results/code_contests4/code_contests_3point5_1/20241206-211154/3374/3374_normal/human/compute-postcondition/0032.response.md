Example Answer:
The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is the next element in list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is the next element in list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`**
