Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is ' '; `file` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is sys.stdout; `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is ' '; `file` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is sys.stdout; `at_start` is True**
