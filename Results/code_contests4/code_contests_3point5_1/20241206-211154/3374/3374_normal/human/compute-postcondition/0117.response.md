According to the code, the loop can execute again if `ai` is divisible by `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is the last value after all divisions by `x` and `ai` is divisible by `x`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `ai` must be divisible by `x` again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `n` and `x` remain the same, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros except for the position `i` which is assigned the value of `cnt`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed plus 1, `ai` is the last element in the list `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times the loop incremented by 1, `ai` is the last value after all divisions by `x` and `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute the next time**.
