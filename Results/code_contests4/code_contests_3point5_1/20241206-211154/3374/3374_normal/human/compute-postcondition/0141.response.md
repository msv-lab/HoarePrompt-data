Example Answer:
The function `func_2` is called with the argument `sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx])`. The function might return a value which could affect the output state, but the exact value is unknown without the function implementation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `n` and `x` remain the same, `pow_x` is a list of size `n`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `ai` is the last element in the list `a` after all divisions by `x`, `cnt` is the total number of times the loop executed for each element in `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`.
Output State: **`t` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `n` and `x` remain the same, `pow_x` is a list of size `n`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `ai` is the last element in the list `a` after all divisions by `x`, `cnt` is the total number of times the loop executed for each element in `a`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`.**
