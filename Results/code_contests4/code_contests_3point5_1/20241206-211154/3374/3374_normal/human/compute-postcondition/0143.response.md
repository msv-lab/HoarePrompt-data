The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. However, it is expected that the function will read input from the user or a file to obtain the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and the array `a`. The constraints for these values are specified as follows: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array, x is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, and a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are positive integers representing the initial values in the array.**

The function `func_1` is expected to process the input data for each test case and perform certain operations based on the given constraints, but the specific functionality is not provided in this description.
