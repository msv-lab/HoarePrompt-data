Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned based on the keyword arguments passed to the `pop` method. If no keyword arguments are passed, `sep` is assigned the value `' '` and `file` is assigned `sys.stdout`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is ' '; `file` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is sys.stdout.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is ' '; `file` is assigned based on the keyword arguments, default value is sys.stdout**
