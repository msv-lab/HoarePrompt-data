Example Answer:
`ai` is updated to its integer division by `x`, where `x` is assigned a value previously. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the updated integer division result, `cnt` is incremented by 2, `ai` is divisible by `x` and updated to its integer division by `x` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is the updated integer division result, `cnt` is incremented by 2, `ai` is divisible by `x` and updated to its integer division by `x` for the loop to execute again**
