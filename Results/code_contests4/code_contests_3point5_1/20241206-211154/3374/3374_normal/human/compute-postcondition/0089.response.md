Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `ai` is updated by floor division with `x` multiple times, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was successfully divided by `x` which is the final value, `pow_x[i]` is assigned the final value of `cnt` after all iterations**
