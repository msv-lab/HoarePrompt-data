According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is decremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, and `i` is 0 and `ai` is the first element in the list `a`.
State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0 and `ai` is the first element in the list `a`**
