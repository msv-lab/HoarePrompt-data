According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `t` should be decremented by the total number of times the loop executed + 2.
2. `i` should be incremented by the total number of times the loop executed + 3.
3. `cnt` should be incremented by 1.
4. `ai` should be adjusted to be divisible by `x` and should not be divisible by `x`.
State: **`t` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed + 2, `n` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `pow_x` contains zeros except for position `i`, `a` has at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed + 3, `ai` is the last element in `a` after integer division by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ai` is adjusted to be divisible by `x` and not divisible by `x`**
