According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. If `ai` is divisible by `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ai` is the next element in list `a` and `x` is an assigned integer input. So for the loop to execute the first time, `ai` must be divisible by `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is the next element in list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` is divisible by `x`**
