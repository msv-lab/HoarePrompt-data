Functionality: **The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and writes the values in args to a stream, with a specified separator and end character. If the 'flush' key is present in the keyword arguments, it will attempt to flush the stream. However, the code may raise a KeyError due to the use of kwargs.pop without a default value.**
