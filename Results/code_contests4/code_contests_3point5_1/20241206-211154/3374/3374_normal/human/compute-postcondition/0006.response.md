Postcondition: ***`sep`, `file` are assigned based on the keyword arguments with default values of ' ' and sys.stdout respectively. If `at_start` is False, the program will update `sep` and `file` based on the actual values provided as arguments during function call. If `at_start` is True, no changes will be made to `sep` and `file`. The loop will execute as long as `args` is not empty.***
