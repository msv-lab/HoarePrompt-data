Example Answer:
`cnt` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is `cnt + 1`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`ai` is the new value from list `a`, `i` is updated to `i+1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `pow_x[i]` is updated with the new value of `cnt`**
