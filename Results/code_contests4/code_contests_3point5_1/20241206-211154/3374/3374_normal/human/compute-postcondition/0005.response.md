Example Answer:
The `file.write(sep)` command writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `sep` or `file`, so the output state will depend on the actual values passed as arguments when the function is called. Since `at_start` is False and `args` is not empty, the `file.write(sep)` command will execute. 
Output State: **Depends on the actual values of `sep` and `file` provided as arguments during function call.**
