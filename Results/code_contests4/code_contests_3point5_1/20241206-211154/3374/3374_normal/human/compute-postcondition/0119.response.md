Output State: `t` is decremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `n` and `x` remain the same, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros except for position `i` which is assigned the value of `cnt`, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed plus 1, `ai` is the last element in the list `a` after integer division by `x`, `cnt` is the total number of times the loop incremented by 1, `ai` is the last value after all divisions by `x` and `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute the next time.
