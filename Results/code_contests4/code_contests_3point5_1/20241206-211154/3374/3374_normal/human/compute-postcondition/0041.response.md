Example Answer: 
`ai` is updated by performing floor division by `x`. Since `ai` was previously updated to satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`, after this operation, `ai` will still satisfy the condition. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is updated after performing floor division by `x` to satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is updated after performing floor division by `x` to satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`**
