Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 3 and for the loop to execute again `ai` is divisible by `x`, `ai` is updated by integer division by `x`.**
