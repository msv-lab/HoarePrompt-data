Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` contains the number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` during the loop execution, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`. The loop has finished execution and did not run due to the condition `ai % x == 0` not being met.
