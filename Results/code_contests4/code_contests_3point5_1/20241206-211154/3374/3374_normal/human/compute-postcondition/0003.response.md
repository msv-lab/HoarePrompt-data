According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arguments `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` is assigned based on the keyword arguments with a default value of ' ', `file` is assigned based on the keyword arguments with a default value of sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True. So for the loop to execute, `args` must not be empty.
State: **`sep` is assigned based on the keyword arguments with a default value of ' ', `file` is assigned based on the keyword arguments with a default value of sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute `args` is not empty**
