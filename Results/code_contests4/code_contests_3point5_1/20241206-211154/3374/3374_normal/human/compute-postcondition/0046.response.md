Example Answer:
`min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`. The previous values of variables are `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers where each element represents the count of divisibility by `x` in the corresponding element of list `a`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a`, `ai` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is the total count of divisibility by `x` in all elements of list `a`, the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is assigned the value of `cnt`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers where each element represents the count of divisibility by `x` in the corresponding element of list `a`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a`, `ai` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is the total count of divisibility by `x` in all elements of list `a`, the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is assigned the value of `cnt`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers where each element represents the count of divisibility by `x` in the corresponding element of list `a`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a`, `ai` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is the total count of divisibility by `x` in all elements of list `a`, the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is assigned the value of `cnt`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in the list `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`**.
