According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` is integer divided by `x`, so it meets the condition. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `t` should remain decremented by 1
- `n` and `x` should stay assigned
- `pow_x` should remain a list of size `n` filled with zeros
- `a` should have at least `n` elements
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- `ai` should be updated to the next element in the list `a`
- `cnt` should be incremented by 1

State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
