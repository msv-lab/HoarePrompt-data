Example Answer:
`ai` is integer divided by `x`, so the value of `ai` changes accordingly based on the previous value of `ai` and `x`. The rest of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is decremented by 2, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by 2, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by 5, `ai` is integer divided by `x`.
Output State: **`t` is decremented by 2, `n` and `x` are assigned, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros, `a` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is incremented by 2, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by 5, `ai` is integer divided by `x`**
