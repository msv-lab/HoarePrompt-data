Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer inputs after splitting, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the length of list `a` + 1, `ai` is the next element in list `a` after floor division by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the `i-th` element of `pow_x` is updated with the new `cnt`. For the loop to execute again, `ai` must satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`. After the execution of `ai //= x`, the value of `ai` is updated by performing floor division by `x`.
