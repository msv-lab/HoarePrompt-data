According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. The loop does not depend on any external variables other than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, all variables retain their previous values. So, to execute the loop one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`. It should be decremented by 1 to indicate that one more iteration is being executed.
State: **All variables retain their previous values, `t` is decremented by 1**
