Example Answer:
`pow_x` is assigned a list of size `n` filled with zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros.
Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split, `pow_x` is a list of size `n` filled with zeros**
