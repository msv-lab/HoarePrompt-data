Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces. The variables `t`, `n`, and `x` retain their previous values, and `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split.
Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping two integers from the input split**
