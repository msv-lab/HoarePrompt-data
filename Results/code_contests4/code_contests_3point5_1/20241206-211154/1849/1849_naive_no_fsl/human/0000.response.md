Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string and counts the number of '(' and ')' characters, as well as the number of '#' characters. It then calculates the number of ')' characters needed to replace each '#' character in order to make the string beautiful. The program iterates through the string and updates the count of '(' and ')' characters accordingly. If at any point there are more ')' characters than '(' characters, it prints -1 and exits.

The program outputs the correct number of ')' characters needed to replace each '#' character in order to make the string beautiful for all the given test cases. Additionally, it handles the case where there is no way to make the string beautiful by checking if there are more ')' characters than '(' characters at any point during the iteration.
