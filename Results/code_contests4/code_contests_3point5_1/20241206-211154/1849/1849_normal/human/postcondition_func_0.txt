Functionality: The function `func` reads a string `s` from the input and performs operations based on the counts of '(', ')', and '#' characters in the string. It calculates certain values and updates variables accordingly within a loop. If at any point during the loop, the count of ')' exceeds the count of '(', the function prints -1 and exits the loop. Finally, the function prints the calculated values as output. The function does not return any value.
