Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately reads the input string `s` and calculates the counts of '(', ')', and '#' characters.
- It iterates through the characters of the string, updating the counts of '(' and ')' characters accordingly.
- It calculates the number of ')' characters to be replaced for each '#' character based on the counts of '(' and ')' characters.
- If at any point during the iteration, the count of ')' characters exceeds the count of '(', it correctly prints -1 and exits the loop.
- Finally, the code prints the calculated values as output, satisfying the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality and do not describe any additional edge cases that the code might not cover.
