Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads a string `s` and calculates the counts of '(', ')', and '#' characters. It then iterates through the string, updating the counts accordingly and checking if the string remains beautiful. If at any point the count of ')' exceeds the count of '(', it prints -1 and exits the loop. Finally, it prints the calculated values for '#' characters. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description to help Malek open the locked door based on the rules provided.
