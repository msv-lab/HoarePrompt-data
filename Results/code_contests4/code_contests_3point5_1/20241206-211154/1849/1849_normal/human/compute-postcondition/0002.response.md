Example Answer:
The variables `left`, `right`, and `sh` are assigned the count of '(', ')', and '#' in the string `s` respectively. The string `s` contains characters '(', ')', and '#'. The counts are stored in their respective variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10^5, containing only the characters '(', ')', and '#'; `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#'.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 10^5, containing only the characters '(', ')', and '#'; `left` is the count of '(', `right` is the count of ')', and `sh` is the count of '#'**
