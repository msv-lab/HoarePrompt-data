Example Answer:
The lambda function `rstr` is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state remains the same with `s` being a string of length between 1 and 10^5, containing only the characters '(', ')', and '#'.
Output State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 10^5, containing only the characters '(', ')', and '#'.**
