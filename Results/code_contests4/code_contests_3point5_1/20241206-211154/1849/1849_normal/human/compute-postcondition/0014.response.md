Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right`, `sh`, `ans` is [abs(right - sh - 1)], `p` are integers. If the character at index `i` is '(', `left` is decreased by 1. If the character at index `i` is not '(', and is ')', `right` is decreased by 1. If the character at index `i` is not '(', and not ')', `left`, `right` are decreased by ans[p], `sh`, `p` are incremented by 1.***
