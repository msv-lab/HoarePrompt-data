Example Answer:
Since the code snippet decrements the value of `left` by 1, the output state will be: `s` is a string of length at least 1, `left` is decreased by 1, `right`, `sh`, `ans`, `p`, `j` are integers.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 1, `left` is decreased by 1, `right`, `sh`, `ans`, `p`, `j` are integers**
