Example Answer:
The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right - ans[p]`, `sh`, `ans`, `p` is an integer incremented by 1, `j` is an integer.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right - ans[p]`, `sh`, `ans`, `p` is an integer incremented by 1, `j` is an integer**
