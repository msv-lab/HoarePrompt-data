Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right`, `sh`, `ans`, `p` are integers. If the character at index `i` is '(', `left` is decreased by 1. If the character at index `i` is not '(', and is ')', `right` is decreased by 1. If the character at index `i` is not '(', and not ')', `left`, `right` are decreased by ans[p], `sh`, `p` are incremented by 1. Additionally, the current state of the program satisfies the condition that `right` is greater than `left`.***
