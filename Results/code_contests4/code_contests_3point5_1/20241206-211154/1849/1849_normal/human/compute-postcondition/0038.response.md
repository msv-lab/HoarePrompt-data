Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right`, `sh`, `ans`, `p`, `j` are integers. If `right` is greater than `left`, the program exits immediately with the given values of the variables. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of the variables as described in the precondition.***
