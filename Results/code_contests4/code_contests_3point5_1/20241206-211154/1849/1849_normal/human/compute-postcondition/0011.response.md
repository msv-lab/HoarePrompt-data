Example Answer:
The value of `right` is decremented by the value stored in `ans[p]`, and `ans` is defined as [abs(right - sh - 1)]. Since the character at index `i` is not ')', the value of `ans` is calculated based on the current values of `right`, `sh`, and `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right' is decreased by ans[p], `sh`, `p`, `j`, `i` are all counts or indices as described in the precondition, `ans` is [abs(right - sh - 1)].
Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right' is decreased by ans[p], `sh`, `p`, `j`, `i` are all counts or indices as described in the precondition, `ans` is [abs(right - sh - 1)]**
