Output State: **At the end of the loop, `s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right`, `sh`, `ans`, `p`, and `j` are integers. If `right` is greater than `left`, the loop exits immediately. Otherwise, the loop continues with the updated values of the variables as described in the loop code.**
