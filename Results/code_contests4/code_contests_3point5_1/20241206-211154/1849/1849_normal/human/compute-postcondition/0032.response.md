Example Answer:
The value of `right` is decreased by the value of `ans[p]`. The previous values of `right` and `ans` are known, so the new value of `right` is `right - ans[p]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right - ans[p]`, `sh`, `ans`, `p`, `j` are integers.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 1, `left`, `right - ans[p]`, `sh`, `ans`, `p`, `j` are integers**
