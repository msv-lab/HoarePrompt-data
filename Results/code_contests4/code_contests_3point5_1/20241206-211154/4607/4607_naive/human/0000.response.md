Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program first reads the input which represents the number of cards and the sequence of integers on the cards. It then sorts the sequence in ascending order. 
Based on the number of cards, the program checks different conditions to determine the possible numbers that can be written on the additional card to form an arithmetic progression.
The program handles various cases such as when there is only one card, two cards, or more than two cards. It also considers cases where the common difference between consecutive numbers is the same or different.
The program correctly calculates and prints the numbers that can be written on the additional card to form an arithmetic progression or prints -1 if infinite numbers can be written.
Overall, the program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output.
