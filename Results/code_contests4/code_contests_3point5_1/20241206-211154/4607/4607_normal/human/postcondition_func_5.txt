The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function. The function does not accept any parameters and does not directly calculate the sum of integers in the list representing Alexander's cards as mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the functionality of the function is primarily to manage thread execution and handle system configuration settings.
