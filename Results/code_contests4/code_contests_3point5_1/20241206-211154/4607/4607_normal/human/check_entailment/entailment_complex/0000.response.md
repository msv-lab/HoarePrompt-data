Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the annotations, it appears that the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. The functions are appropriately defined and utilized within the main program to process the input sequence of integers on Alexander's cards and determine the additional number that Arthur can add to form an arithmetic progression. The code considers different scenarios based on the length of the input sequence and the differences between consecutive elements to calculate the correct output. Additionally, the annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function and how they contribute to the overall correctness of the program. Since no discrepancies or missing logic were found between the code, annotations, and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed true.
