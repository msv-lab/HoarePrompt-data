Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input, processes it, and then determines the possible numbers that Arthur can add to the cards to form an arithmetic progression. It covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output based on the input.

The program handles cases where Arthur can write infinitely many distinct integers on the card by returning -1. It also handles cases where there is only one possible integer that Arthur can write on the card, as well as cases where there are multiple possible integers.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected output for different scenarios.
