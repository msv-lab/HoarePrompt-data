After reviewing the provided code and the problem description, along with the output hints, I believe the correctness of the code is as follows:

Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
- The code appears to correctly address the problem description of finding the minimum number Arthur can write on the card to form an arithmetic progression with Alexander's cards.
- The code considers different scenarios based on the number of cards Alexander has and the differences between consecutive elements to determine the number Arthur should write on the additional card.
- It accounts for cases where there is only one card, two cards with the same value, two cards with different values, and multiple cards with varying differences between them.
- The code correctly handles scenarios where the arithmetic progression can be formed with a specific number written on the additional card.
- The implementation seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output based on the given input.
- The output hints align with the code logic and do not introduce any conflicting scenarios that would suggest the code is incorrect.
