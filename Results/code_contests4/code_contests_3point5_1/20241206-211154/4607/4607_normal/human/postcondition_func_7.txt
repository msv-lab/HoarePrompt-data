The function func_8 accepts a list `l` of integers with `n` elements where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105 and returns the list `l` sorted based on the key function `getKey`. The function does not define the `getKey` function, so the sorting behavior is dependent on the implementation of `getKey` which is missing in the provided code.
