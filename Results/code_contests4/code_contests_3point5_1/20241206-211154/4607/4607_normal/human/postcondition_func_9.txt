The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= n <= 10^5 and each integer is a positive number not exceeding 10^8. The function then performs a bitwise AND operation between x and the bitwise negation of x-1, returning the list x and the result of this operation.
