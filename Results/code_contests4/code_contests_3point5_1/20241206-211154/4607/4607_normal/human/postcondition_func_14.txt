The function `func_15` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 <= n <= 10^5. Depending on the value of `n`, the function returns True or False based on specific conditions. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns False. If n is between 2 and 3 inclusive, it returns True. If n is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False. If none of these conditions are met, it checks for further divisibility by numbers of the form 6k Â± 1 up to the square root of n and returns False if divisible, otherwise, it returns True. The functionality covers cases where the code does not align with the annotations.
