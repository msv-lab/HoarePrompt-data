#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input value provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and returns the input value provided by the user. The code does exactly what the annotations state without any missing functionality or edge cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object after converting the input values to integers and splitting them by space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes user input, converts the input values to integers, splits them by space, and returns a map object.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sequence of integers on Alexander's cards has length n. Each integer in the sequence is a positive integer and doesn't exceed 10^8.**
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by mapping the input sequence of integers, where each integer is a positive number not exceeding 10^8
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a sequence of integers as input, splits the input by a space, maps each integer to a string, and returns a list of these string representations. The function does not specify any handling of invalid inputs or edge cases, such as non-integer inputs or inputs exceeding the specified limits.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and the sequence of integers on Alexander's cards is non-empty.**
def func_5():

    #The program returns a list of integers after calling the function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_3` and returns the list of integers generated by `func_3`. The function assumes that func_3 will always return a sequence of integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function. The function does not accept any parameters and does not directly calculate the sum of integers in the list representing Alexander's cards as mentioned in the annotations. Therefore, the functionality of the function is primarily to manage thread execution and handle system configuration settings.

def func_7(item):

    #The program returns the second element of the list 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts a list of integers 'item' and returns the second element of the list. It assumes that the list 'item' has at least two elements. If the list has fewer than two elements, this function will result in an 'IndexError' because it attempts to access the second element which may not exist.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers containing n elements where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105.**
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns the list 'l' sorted based on the key function 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list `l` of integers with `n` elements where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105 and returns the list `l` sorted based on the key function `getKey`. The function does not define the `getKey` function, so the sorting behavior is dependent on the implementation of `getKey` which is missing in the provided code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It generates a 2D list where each row contains the same list 'm' of positive integers that do not exceed 10^8. There are 'n' rows in total. The parameter `num` is not used in the function. The function creates the 2D list based on the given parameters.

    #The program returns the list x and the result of the bitwise AND operation between x and the bitwise negation of x-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= n <= 10^5 and each integer is a positive number not exceeding 10^8. The function then performs a bitwise AND operation between x and the bitwise negation of x-1, returning the list x and the result of this operation.

def func_11(n):

    #The program returns the binary representation of the integer 'n' without the prefix '0b'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_11 accepts an integer n within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and returns the binary representation of n without the prefix '0b'.

    return res
    #The program returns the final updated value 'res' after all iterations of the loop have executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts three parameters: `x`, a positive integer representing the number of cards (1 <= x <= 10^5), `y`, a list of integers representing the numbers on Alexander's cards, and `p`, an integer representing the number Arthur wants to add to the cards. It then iterates through the list `y`, updating the value `res` based on certain conditions. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the function returns the final updated value 'res'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_14 accepts two parameters, x and y, where x is an integer representing the number of cards and y is a list of positive integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor of all the integers in list y and returns that value. If y is empty (y = 0), the function returns x.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 <= n <= 10^5. Depending on the value of `n`, the function returns True or False based on specific conditions. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns False. If n is between 2 and 3 inclusive, it returns True. If n is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False. If none of these conditions are met, it checks for further divisibility by numbers of the form 6k ± 1 up to the square root of n and returns False if divisible, otherwise, it returns True. The functionality covers cases where the code does not align with the annotations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a sequence of integers, printing them to a file or `sys.stdout`. The function handles optional keyword arguments `sep` for the separator, `file` for the output file, `end` for the line ending, and `flush` for flushing the stream. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs the task of printing the input sequence to the specified file or standard output. It is expected to work with an input sequence of integers representing numbers on cards.
