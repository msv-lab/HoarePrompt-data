The function `func_13` accepts three parameters: `x`, a positive integer representing the number of cards (1 <= x <= 10^5), `y`, a list of integers representing the numbers on Alexander's cards, and `p`, an integer representing the number Arthur wants to add to the cards. It then iterates through the list `y`, updating the value `res` based on certain conditions. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the function returns the final updated value 'res'.
