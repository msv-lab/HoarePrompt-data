Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a` and `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If the length of the unique elements in `g` is greater than 2, then all the elements in `g` are the same, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`.**
