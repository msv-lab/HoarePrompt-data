Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. The length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1. There exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0. Moreover, after entering the if condition, the length of the unique elements in `g` is greater than or equal to 2***
