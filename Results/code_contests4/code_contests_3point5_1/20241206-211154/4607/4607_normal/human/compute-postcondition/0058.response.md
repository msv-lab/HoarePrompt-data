According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of list `l` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the conditions should be adjusted so that the loop executes. Since the loop starts at index 1, the length of list `l` must be at least 2. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is assigned the value of the first element in list `l`, and the length of list `l` is at least 2.
