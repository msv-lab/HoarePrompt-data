Example Answer:
Since `l` contains the result of the subtraction of adjacent elements in list `a`, after executing `l.append(a[i + 1] - a[i])`, the new subtraction result will be added to `l`. The loop will execute another time only if `n` is greater than the current value of `i`. 
Output State: **`l` contains the updated subtraction results, loop will execute another time if `n` is greater than the current value of `i`**
