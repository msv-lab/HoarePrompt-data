Functionality: **The function `func_17` processes a sequence of integers on Alexander's cards stored in a list `a`. It checks various conditions based on the length of the sequence and the differences between consecutive elements. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value. The annotations describe different scenarios based on the length of the sequence and the differences between elements, but the actual code does not have explicit return statements. The function mainly focuses on manipulating the input sequence `a` and checking conditions based on its elements.**
