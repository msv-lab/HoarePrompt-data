Example Answer:
The function `file.write(str(x))` will execute only if `at_start` is True. Since `at_start` is True, the function will write the string representation of `x` to a file. The state of the variables remains unchanged if `at_start` is False.
Output State: **If `at_start` is True, the string representation of `x` is written to a file. If `at_start` is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
