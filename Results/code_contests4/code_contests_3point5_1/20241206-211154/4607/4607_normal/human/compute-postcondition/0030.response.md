Example Answer:
`l` appends the absolute difference between the next element and the current element in list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `l` will contain the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`. The value of `g` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `i` is 0**
