According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of the length of list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, and `gc` is updated based on the function `func_14`. Since `i` is equal to `n - 1`, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to be within the range of the length of list `l`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the function `func_14`**
