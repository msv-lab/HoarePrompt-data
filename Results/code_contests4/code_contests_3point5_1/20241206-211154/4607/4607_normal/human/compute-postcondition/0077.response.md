Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is 3, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the function `func_14` for all elements in list `l`, `x` is calculated as `a[3] + (a[4] - a[3]) // 2`, `a` is appended with the value `a[3] + (a[4] - a[3]) // 2`, `x` is assigned the value of `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`**
