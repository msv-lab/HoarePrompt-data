Example Answer:
The absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is calculated and appended to the list `l`. Since `i` is 3, the absolute difference between `a[4]` and `a[3]` is calculated and added to `l`. The value of `l` is updated with this new absolute difference. The values of `n`, `g`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between the first two elements of list `a` and `a[3]`, `i` is 3, `g` now contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a` and the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between the first two elements of list `a` and `a[3]`, `i` is 3, `g` now contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a` and the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`.**
