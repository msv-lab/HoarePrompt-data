At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a` and the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` has been appended to `l`, `i` is 2. Since the loop is iterating over `range(n-1)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and become 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a` and the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` has been appended to `l`, `i` is 3**
