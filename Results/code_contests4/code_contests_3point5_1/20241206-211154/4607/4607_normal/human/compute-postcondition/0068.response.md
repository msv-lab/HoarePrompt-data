Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is 1, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the function `func_14` for all elements in list `l`, abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]) is not equal to gc, `x` is calculated as a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2, a contains the appended value `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`**
