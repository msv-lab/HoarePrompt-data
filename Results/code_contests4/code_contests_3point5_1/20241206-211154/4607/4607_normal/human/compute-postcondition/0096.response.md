Postcondition: ***`l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements in list `a` for all elements in the range `n-1`, where `n` is the length of list `a`. If the unique elements in `l` have the same value, the behavior depends on the function `func_18(x)` and the initial state of the program. Otherwise, if the length of `l` is not equal to 1, the program maintains the original state of `l`.***
