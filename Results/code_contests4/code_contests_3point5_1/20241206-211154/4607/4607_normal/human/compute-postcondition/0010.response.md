Example Answer:
The `write` method is called on the `file` object with the value of `sep`. This will write the value of `sep` to the file. The variables `at_start`, `args`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `file` has written the value of `sep`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `file` has written the value of `sep`**
