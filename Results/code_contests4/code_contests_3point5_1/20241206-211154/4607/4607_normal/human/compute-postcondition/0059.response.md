Example Answer: 
`gc` is updated by calling `func_14` with current value of `gc` and `l[i]`. The value of `l[i]` is not specified, but based on the initial state where there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, it can be assumed that `l[i]` might be 0. Therefore, the value of `gc` may change based on the function `func_14`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the function `func_14`**
