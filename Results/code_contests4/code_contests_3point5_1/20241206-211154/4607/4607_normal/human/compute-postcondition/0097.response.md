Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is sorted in ascending order. If the unique elements in `g` are greater than 2, the behavior of the program depends on the unique elements in `l`. If the length of list `l` is not equal to 1, the program maintains the original state of `l`. Otherwise, if the unique elements in `l` have the same value, the behavior depends on the function `func_18(x)` and the initial state of the program.***
