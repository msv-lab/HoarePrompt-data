According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to the length of list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, and `gc` is updated based on the specific conditions of the function `func_14`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n+1`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the specific conditions of the function `func_14`**
