According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `at_start` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in the list.
State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list**
