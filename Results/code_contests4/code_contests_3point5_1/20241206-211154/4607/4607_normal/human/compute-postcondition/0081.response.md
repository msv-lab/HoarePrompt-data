Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is at least 2, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the function `func_14` for all elements in list `l`, `x` is calculated as `a[-2] + (a[-1] - a[-2]) // 2`, `a` is appended with the value `a[-2] + (a[-1] - a[-2]) // 2`, if `abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]) != gc`, `x` is assigned the value of `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`, and `a` is updated with the new value appended.**
