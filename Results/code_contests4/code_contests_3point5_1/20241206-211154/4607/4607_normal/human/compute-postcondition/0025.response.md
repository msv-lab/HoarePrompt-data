Functionality: **The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a sequence of integers, printing them to a file or `sys.stdout`. The function handles optional keyword arguments `sep` for the separator, `file` for the output file, `end` for the line ending, and `flush` for flushing the stream. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs the task of printing the input sequence to the specified file or standard output. It is expected to work with an input sequence of integers representing numbers on cards.**
