Example Answer:
The difference between the first two elements of list `a` is calculated and stored in the variable `g`. The index `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `g`, `l`, and `i` are known. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `i` is 2**
