According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the initial state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is 1, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the function `func_14` for all elements in list `l`**
