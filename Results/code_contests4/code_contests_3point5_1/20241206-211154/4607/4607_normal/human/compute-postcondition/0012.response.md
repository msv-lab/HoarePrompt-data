The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of the variable `x` to the file. If `at_start` is False, then the value of `sep` is already written in the file. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program. 

Output State: **If `at_start` is False, `sep` has been written to the file. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.**
