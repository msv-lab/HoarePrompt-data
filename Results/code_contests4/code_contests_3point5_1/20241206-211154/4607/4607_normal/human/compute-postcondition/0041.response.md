Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If the length of the unique elements in `g` is greater than 2, the program will return a specific result based on that condition.***
