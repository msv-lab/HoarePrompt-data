According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, so the loop can execute. However, `g` and `l` are empty lists and are not directly related to the loop condition. The loop will iterate `n - 1` times, so the states need to be adjusted to `g` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, and `i` starts at 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
