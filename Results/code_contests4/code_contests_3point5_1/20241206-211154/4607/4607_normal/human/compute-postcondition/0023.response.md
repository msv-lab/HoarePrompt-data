Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the last element in the list, `file` has written the values of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, `end` has been popped from `kwargs` and written to the file. If 'flush' key is popped from `kwargs` and its value is True, the overall state remains the same.***
