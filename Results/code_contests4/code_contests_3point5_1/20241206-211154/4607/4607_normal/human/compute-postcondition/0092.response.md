Example Answer:
`func_18(1)` is called with the input `1`. The function calculates the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a list with one element, resulting in an empty list `l`. Since the length of unique elements in `l` is 1 (empty list), all elements in `l` are the same.
Output State: **`l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements in list `a` for all elements in the range `n-1`, where `n` is the length of list `a`. If the length of the unique elements in `l` is equal to 1, then all elements in `l` are the same**.
