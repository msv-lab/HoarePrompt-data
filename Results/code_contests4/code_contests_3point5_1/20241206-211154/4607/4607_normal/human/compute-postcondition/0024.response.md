The function `func_18` accepts no parameters. It is expected to take an input sequence of integers representing the numbers on Alexander's cards. The input sequence consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cards, followed by n positive integers that do not exceed 10^8. The function does not return any value, but it is meant to perform a specific operation or task based on the input sequence of integers.
