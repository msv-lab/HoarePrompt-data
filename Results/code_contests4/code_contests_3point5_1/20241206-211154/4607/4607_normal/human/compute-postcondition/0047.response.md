Example Answer:
The list `l` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the affected variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` now sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` now sorted in ascending order**
