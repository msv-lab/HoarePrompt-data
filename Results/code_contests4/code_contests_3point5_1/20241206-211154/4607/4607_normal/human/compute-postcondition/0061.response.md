Example Answer:
`gc` is updated based on the function `func_14` with the parameters `gc` and `l[i]`. The value of `i` is `n`, so the function is called with the current values of `gc` and `l[n]`. Since `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, and there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` will be updated accordingly based on the function `func_14`. The length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, so `gc` will be modified based on the specific conditions of the function `func_14`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the specific conditions of the function `func_14`**
