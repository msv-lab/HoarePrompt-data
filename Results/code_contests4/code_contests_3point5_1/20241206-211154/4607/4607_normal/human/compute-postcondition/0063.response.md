Example Answer:
`gc` is updated based on the specific conditions of the function `func_14` with the parameters `gc` and `l[i]`. The specific conditions of the function `func_14` are not provided, so the exact impact on `gc` cannot be determined. However, `i` is equal to `n+1`, and the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, so `gc` is updated accordingly based on the function `func_14`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `i` is equal to `n+1`, the length of the unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1, there exists at least one absolute difference in `l` that is equal to 0, `gc` is updated based on the specific conditions of the function `func_14`**
