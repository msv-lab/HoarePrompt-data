Example Answer:
`l` is initialized as an empty list, so no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, the sequence of integers on Alexander's cards is a list of positive integers in ascending order, `a` is the return value of `func_5()`, `g` is an empty list, and `l` is an empty list.
