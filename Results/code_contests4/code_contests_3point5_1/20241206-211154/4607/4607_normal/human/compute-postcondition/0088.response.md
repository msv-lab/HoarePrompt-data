According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` contains the updated subtraction results, and `n` is greater than the current value of `i`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.
State: **`l` contains the updated subtraction results, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the current value of `i + 1`**
