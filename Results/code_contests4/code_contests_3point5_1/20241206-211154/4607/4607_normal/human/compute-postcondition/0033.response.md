Example Answer:
`l` appends the absolute difference between the elements at positions `i + 1` and `i` from list `a`. Since `i` is 2, `l` will append the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. The previous values of variables are `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `i` is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a` and the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` has been appended to `l`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a` and the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` has been appended to `l`, `i` is 2**
