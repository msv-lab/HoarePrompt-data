According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `i` is 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 1 less than `n - 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `g` contains the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first two elements of list `a`, `i` is 1**
