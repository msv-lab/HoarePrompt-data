Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first sorts the input numbers and handles special cases where n is 1 or 2 separately.
2. For n=1, it prints -1 as there are infinitely many possible numbers Arthur can write on the card.
3. For n=2, it checks if the two numbers are the same, if yes then it prints 1 and the number itself, otherwise it calculates the possible numbers based on the arithmetic progression condition.
4. For n>2, it calculates the common difference between consecutive numbers and then checks if all the differences are the same. If not, it calculates the possible number that Arthur can write on the card.
5. The program handles all edge cases and scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
