The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are integers such that 1 <= a,b <= 10^9 and a <= b. 
In Case_1, the function returns the result of subtracting 'b' from 'a' if a is greater than b.
In Case_2, the function returns the result of subtracting 'a' from 'b' if a is less than or equal to b. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer parameters a and b within the specified constraints and return the result of the subtraction based on the relationship between a and b. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters a and b, and returns the result of subtracting 'b' from 'a' if a > b, and the result of subtracting 'a' from 'b' if a <= b.**
