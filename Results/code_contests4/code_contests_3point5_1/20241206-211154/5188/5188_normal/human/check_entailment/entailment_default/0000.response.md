Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also do not agree with the code. For example, the code does not handle the case when n * m = 2 properly. The code calculates the values of 'o' and 'e' based on the parity of 'l' and 'r', but this approach is not correct and does not cover all possible scenarios as specified in the problem description. The code also contains duplicate lines at the end.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
