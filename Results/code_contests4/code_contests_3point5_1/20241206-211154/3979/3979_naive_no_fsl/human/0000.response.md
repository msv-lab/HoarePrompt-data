Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of bad cells that one will have to visit in order to travel from square (x1; y1) to square (x2; y2) based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program calculates the distance based on the conditions |x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a) and |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b) and returns the maximum of the two distances as the output. The logic used in the program seems to be correct and handles the given conditions appropriately. 

Overall, the program appears to be following the problem description and is providing the expected output for the given inputs.
