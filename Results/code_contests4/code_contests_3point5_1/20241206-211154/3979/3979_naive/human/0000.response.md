Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It does not correctly calculate the minimum number of bad cells that one will have to visit in order to travel from square (x1; y1) to square (x2; y2). 

One potential case where the program fails is when a = 2, b = 2, x1 = 1, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = 1.

For this input, the correct output should be 1, as the minimum number of bad cells to visit is 1. However, the program will output 0, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, based on this case, the Correctness of the program is **False**.
