Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `c` and `d`, both of which are integers. The function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`, regardless of the value of `c`. This matches the problem description as there is no restriction on the value of `c` in the problem statement. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
