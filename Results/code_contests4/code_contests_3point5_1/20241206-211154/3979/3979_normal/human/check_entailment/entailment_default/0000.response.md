Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly computes the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit on the way from (x1; y1) to (x2; y2) as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is used to calculate the division of parameters `c` and `d`, and it handles negative values correctly by returning the result of the division regardless of the sign of `c`. The main code then calculates the values based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description and prints the maximum of the two values, which represents the minimum number of bad cells to visit. 

The code logic aligns with the problem statement, and there are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not produce the expected output based on the given requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
