The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `c` and `d`. `c` is an integer. The function has two cases:
Case 1: If `c` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`.
Case 2: If `c` is less than 0, the function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `c` and `d`, and return the result of dividing `c` by `d` based on the conditions specified in the two cases.
