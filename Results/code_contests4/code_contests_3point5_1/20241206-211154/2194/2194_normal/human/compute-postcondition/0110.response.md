According to the code, the loop can execute if n is greater than or equal to 6 since n - 3 should be at least 3 for the loop to run. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be the index of the first occurrence of '2'
- `j` should be n - 3
- `ans` should be incremented by n - i
- `temp` should be the element at index j in list t
- The element at index j in list t should be the same as the element at index j - 1
- The first element of list t should be '0'
- n should not be equal to 3

State: **n is the length of list t and is at least 6, i is the index of the first occurrence of '2', j is n - 3, ans is incremented by n - i, temp is the element at index j in list t, the element at index j in list t is now the same as the element at index j - 1, the first element of list t is '0', n is not equal to 3**
