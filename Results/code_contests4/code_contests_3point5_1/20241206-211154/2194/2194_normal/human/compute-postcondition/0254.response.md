Example Answer:
The value of `t[j]` is assigned the value of `temp`, and `temp` retains the value of `t[j + 1]`. Therefore, after execution, `t[j]` is equal to the previous value of `t[j + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` retains the value of `t[j + 1]**
