Example Answer:
`fin` is assigned the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`. The value of `fin` can be any integer, and `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0'`. The value of `cnt` is 2, but it is not involved in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0'`, `cnt` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0'`, `cnt` is 2**
