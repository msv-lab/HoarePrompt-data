Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value 0. The value of `n` is the length of list `t`, but the specific value of `n` or `t` is unknown, so `ans` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0**
