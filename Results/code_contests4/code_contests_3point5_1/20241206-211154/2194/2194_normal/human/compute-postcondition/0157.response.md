Example Answer:
The value of `t[j]` is updated to `temp`, which is the value at index `j` in the modified list `t`. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 3, `i` is 0, there is no occurrence of '5' in the modified list `t`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the value at index `j` in the modified list `t`, `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, `temp` is the value at index `j` in the modified list `t`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 3, `i` is 0, there is no occurrence of '5' in the modified list `t`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the value at index `j` in the modified list `t`, `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[j]` is now equal to `temp`, `temp` is the value at index `j` in the modified list `t`**
