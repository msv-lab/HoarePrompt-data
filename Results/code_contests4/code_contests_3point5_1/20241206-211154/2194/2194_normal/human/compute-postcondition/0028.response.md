Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value of `n - 1 - i`, where `n` is the length of list `t` and `i` is decremented by 1. The updated value of `ans` is added to the previous value of `ans`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions specified and incremented by `n - 1 - i`, `cnt` is adjusted, `i` is decremented by 1, and `t[i]` meets the conditions specified for the loop to execute another iteration.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions specified and incremented by `n - 1 - i`, `cnt` is adjusted, `i` is decremented by 1, and `t[i]` meets the conditions specified for the loop to execute another iteration**
