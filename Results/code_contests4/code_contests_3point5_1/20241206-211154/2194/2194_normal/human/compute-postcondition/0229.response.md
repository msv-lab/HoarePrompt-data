Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the new value of `ans` will be the previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `fin`, and `cnt` maintain their previous values, `ans` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `t[j]` is updated with the value of `temp`.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `fin`, and `cnt` maintain their previous values, `ans` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `t[j]` is updated with the value of `temp`**
