According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since n is not equal to 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, ans is increased by `(n - i - 2)` times does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `ans` is increased by `(n - 3 - 2)` times. Also, the first element of `t` is '0', so the state needs to mention this fact. Lastly, temp retains the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration, so temp should retain the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration of this loop.
State: **`ans` is increased by `(n - 3 - 2)` times, `temp` retains the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration, the first element of `t` is '0', for the loop to execute `n` is not equal to 3**
