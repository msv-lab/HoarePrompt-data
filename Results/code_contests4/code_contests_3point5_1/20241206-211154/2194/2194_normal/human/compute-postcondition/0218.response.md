Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `fin`, and `cnt` maintain their previous values. `ans` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 to satisfy the range condition specified in the loop statement. If `t[i]` is equal to '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
