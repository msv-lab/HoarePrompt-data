Functionality: **The function reads a string input, performs various calculations based on the occurrences of '0', '2', '5', and '7' in the input string, and adjusts the value of 'fin' accordingly. It then checks if 'fin' exceeds 10^10 and prints the final value of 'fin' if it does, otherwise it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
