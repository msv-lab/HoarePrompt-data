Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, `ans` is equal to 10^15, `j` is equal to `n-2`, `temp` is the value at index `n` in the list `t`, `t[n-1]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[n]` is now equal to `temp`, `i` is the index where '7' was found in the list `t` or -1 if '7' was not found, there is no occurrence of '5' in the modified list `t`, the first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is equal to 3, the function returns `ans + n - 3`. Otherwise, `n`, `i`, `ans + n - 3`, `j`, `temp`, `t`, and `t[n]` satisfy the initial conditions regardless of the value of `t[i]`. If the loop executes, `ans` will be incremented by `n - 3`.***
