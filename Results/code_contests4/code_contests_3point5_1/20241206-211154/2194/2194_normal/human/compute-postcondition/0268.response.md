Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is assigned to 10^15. The other variables such as `n`, `i`, `temp`, and `t` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 10^15, `n` is 3, `temp` retains the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration, `t`'s first element is '0'.
Output State: **`ans` is 10^15, `n` is 3, `temp` retains the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration, `t`'s first element is '0'**
