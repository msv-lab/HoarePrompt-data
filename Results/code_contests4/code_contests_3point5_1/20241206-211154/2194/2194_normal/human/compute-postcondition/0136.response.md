According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse order starting from `n-1` to 0. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i-1` and the condition for the loop to continue should be that `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is equal to 0 for the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `i-1` and `i` should be greater than or equal to 0**
