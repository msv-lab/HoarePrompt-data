Example Answer:
The value at index `j + 1` in list `t` is assigned the value at index `j` in list `t`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: variable `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value at index `j + 1` in list `t**.
