According to the code, the loop will execute if there is no occurrence of '5' in list `t` and it will iterate through all elements in reverse order until reaching -1 for `i`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1, there is no occurrence of '5' in list `t`, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
