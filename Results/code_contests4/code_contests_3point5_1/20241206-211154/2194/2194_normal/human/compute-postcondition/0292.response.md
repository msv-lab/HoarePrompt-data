Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeros. `s` is a string input. `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `fin`, `ans`, and `cnt` are all integers satisfying the given conditions. If `zero` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0'`, and `cnt` is 2. If `two` is greater than or equal to 1 and `five` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`. In the if block, `ans` is increased by `(n - i - 2)` times, `temp` retains the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration. The first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is equal to 3, then `ans` is 10^15. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the number of times `t[i]` is equal to '0' in `t`. `temp` retains the value of the last element of `t`. For the loop to execute `n` is not equal to 3. If `t[i]` is not equal to '0', the loop breaks out. `fin` is assigned the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`. If `fin` is greater than 10^10, the function prints the value of `fin`. Otherwise, the function does not print anything.***
