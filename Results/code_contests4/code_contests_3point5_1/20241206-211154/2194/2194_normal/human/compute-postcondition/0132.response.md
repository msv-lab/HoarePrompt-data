According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The loop iterates over the range from `n-1` to 0 in reverse order. So, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and `i` is equal to `n-1` to ensure the loop executes for the first time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, for the loop to execute the first time**
