Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated by adding the result of `n - 2 - i`, `cnt` is 2, for the first loop iteration `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `t[i]` is equal to '0'. Additionally, if `cnt` is equal to 1, the function updates `ans` and `cnt` accordingly, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
