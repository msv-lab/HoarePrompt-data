Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n`, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations + 2*(n-i), `j` is equal to `n-2`, `temp` is the value at index `n` in the list `t`, `t[n-1]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[n]` is now equal to `temp`, `i` is the index where '7' was found in the list `t` or -1 if '7' was not found, there is no occurrence of '5' in the modified list `t`, and the first element of `t` is '0'***
