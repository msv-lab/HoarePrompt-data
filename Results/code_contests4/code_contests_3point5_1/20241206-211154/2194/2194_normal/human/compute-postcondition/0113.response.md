Postcondition: ***n is the length of list t and is at least 6, i is the index of the first occurrence of '2', j is n - 3, ans is incremented by n - i, temp is the element at index j in list t, the element at index j in list t is now the same as the element at index j - 1, the first element of list t is '0', n is not equal to 3. If t[i] is not equal to '0', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
