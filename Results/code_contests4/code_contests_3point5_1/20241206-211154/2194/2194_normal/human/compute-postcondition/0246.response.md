According to the code, the loop executes in reverse order until reaching the element at index `i` in list `t`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed up to index `i` in reverse order. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is not equal to '5', the loop will execute one more time. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the element at index `i-1` in list `t` must not be equal to '5'.
State: **After the execution of the if else block, the variables maintain their previous values. The loop continues in reverse order until reaching the element at index `i-1`.**
