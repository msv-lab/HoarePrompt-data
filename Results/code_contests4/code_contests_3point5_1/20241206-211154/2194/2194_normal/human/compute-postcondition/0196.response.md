Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is less than `n-2`, `ans` is equal to the updated number of iterations, `j` is equal to `n-3`, `temp` is the value at index `n-1` in the list `t`, `t[n]` is now equal to `temp`, `i` is the index where '7' was found in the list `t` or -1 if '7' was not found. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
