Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by `n - 2 - i`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` are known. Therefore, the output state is: n is the length of list `t`, ans is updated based on the conditions specified, cnt is adjusted, i is decremented by 1, and `t[i]` meets the conditions specified for the loop to execute another iteration, ans is incremented by `n - 2 - i`.
Output State: **n is the length of list `t`, ans is updated based on the conditions specified, cnt is adjusted, i is decremented by 1, and `t[i]` meets the conditions specified for the loop to execute another iteration, ans is incremented by `n - 2 - i`**
