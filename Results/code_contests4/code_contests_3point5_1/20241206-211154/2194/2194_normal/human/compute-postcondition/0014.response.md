According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will iterate from `n - 1` to 0 in reverse order. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. In order for the loop to execute the first time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n` is assigned the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1`**
