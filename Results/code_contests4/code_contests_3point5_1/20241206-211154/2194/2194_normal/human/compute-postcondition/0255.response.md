According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` retains the value of `t[j + 1]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 to move to the next iteration, and `n - 2` remains the same.
State: **variable `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` retains the value of `t[j + 1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1**
