According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2', `j` is `n - 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is the element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, and the element at index `j + 1` in list `t` is now the same as the element at index `j`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2', `j` is `n - 3`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `temp` is the element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, the element at index `j + 1` in list `t` is now the same as the element at index `j`**
