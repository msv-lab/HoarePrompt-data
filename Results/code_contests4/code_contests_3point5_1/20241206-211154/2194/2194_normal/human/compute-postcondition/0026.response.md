Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions specified in the if part. If `t[i]` is equal to '0', `ans` is either the previous value of `ans` plus `n - 1 - i` if `cnt == 0`, or updated by adding `n - 2 - i` if `cnt != 0`. `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if `cnt == 0`, or set to 2 if `cnt != 0`. For the first loop iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and `t[i]` is equal to '0'. If `cnt == 1`, the function updates `ans` and `cnt` according to the conditions specified, potentially breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
