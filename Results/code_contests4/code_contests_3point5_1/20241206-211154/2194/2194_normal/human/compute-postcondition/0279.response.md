According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `n`. If `ans` is increased by an unknown value, then for the loop to execute again `n - 3` must be greater than the new value of `ans`.

State: **`ans` is increased by an unknown value, for the loop to execute again `n - 3` must be greater than the new value of `ans`**
