Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `fin`, and `cnt` maintain their previous values, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, loop continues in reverse order until `n - 1`, loop breaks if it encounters an element equal to '0' or reaches the end of the list, `temp` is assigned the value of the last element in the list `t`, `t` is reversed after the loop finishes executing, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, the last element of list `t` is assigned to `temp`. Additionally, if the element at index `i` in list `t` is equal to '5', the program state remains the same.***
