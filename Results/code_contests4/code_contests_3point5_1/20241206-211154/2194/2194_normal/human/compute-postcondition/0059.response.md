According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse order from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `i` should be `i - 1`, and if `t[i - 1]` is equal to '5', the loop should break. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer and `i` is within the range `0` to `n` inclusive. If `t[i - 1]` is equal to '5', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
