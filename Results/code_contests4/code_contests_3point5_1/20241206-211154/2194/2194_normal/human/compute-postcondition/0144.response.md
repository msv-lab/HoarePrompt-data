Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `ans` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is -1, there is no occurrence of '5' in list `t`, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is -1, there is no occurrence of '5' in list `t`, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
