Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The previous value of `ans` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 1; `temp` is assigned the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`**
