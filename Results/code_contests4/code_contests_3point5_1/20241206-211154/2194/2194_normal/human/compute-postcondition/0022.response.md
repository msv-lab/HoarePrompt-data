Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `cnt` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated by adding the result of `n - 2 - i`, `cnt` is 2, all other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated by adding the result of `n - 2 - i`, `cnt` is 2, all other variables remain unchanged**
