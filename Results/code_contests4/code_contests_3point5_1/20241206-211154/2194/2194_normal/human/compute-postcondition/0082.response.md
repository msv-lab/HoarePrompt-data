Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is `t[n - 1]`, for the loop to execute the first time. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is equal to '2', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
