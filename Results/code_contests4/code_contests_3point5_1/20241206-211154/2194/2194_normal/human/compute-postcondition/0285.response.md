Postcondition: ***`ans` is increased by `(n - i - 2)` times, `temp` retains the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration. The first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is equal to 3, then `ans` is 10^15. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the number of times `t[i]` is equal to '0' in `t`. `temp` retains the value of the last element of `t`. For the loop to execute `n` is not equal to 3. If `t[i]` is not equal to '0', the loop breaks out.***
