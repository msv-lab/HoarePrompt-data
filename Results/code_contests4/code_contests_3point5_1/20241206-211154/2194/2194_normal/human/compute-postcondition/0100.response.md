According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2', `j` is `n - 3`, `ans` is incremented by 2, `temp` is the element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, and the element at index `j + 1` in list `t` is now the same as the element at index `j`. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n - 2`. Since `j` is currently `n - 3`, it needs to be decremented by 1.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2', `j` is `n - 4`, `ans` is incremented by 2, `temp` is the element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, the element at index `j + 1` in list `t` is now the same as the element at index `j`**
