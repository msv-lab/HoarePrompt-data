Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `fin`, and `cnt` maintain their previous values, `ans` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `t[i]` is not equal to '0'. If `t[i]` is equal to '0', the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
