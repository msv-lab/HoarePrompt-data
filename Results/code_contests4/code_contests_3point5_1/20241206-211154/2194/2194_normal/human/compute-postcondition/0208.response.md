Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeros. `s` is a string input. `zero`, `five`, `two`, `seven`, `fin`, `ans`, and `cnt` are all integers satisfying the given conditions. If `zero` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0'`, and `cnt` is 2. If `two` is greater than or equal to 1 and `five` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`. Additionally, if `zero` is greater than or equal to 1 and `five` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`.***
