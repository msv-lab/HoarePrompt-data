According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `t`. Since the loop is iterating over the range from `n - 2` to -1 in reverse order, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 3. Before the loop starts, the key variables that need adjustment are `i`, `j`, and `temp` to satisfy the loop conditions.

State: **`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is `t[n - 1]`, for the loop to execute the first time**
