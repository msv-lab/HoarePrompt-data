According to the code, the loop will execute in reverse order from `n-1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `i-1`, so `i` becomes -1. Since the loop condition requires `i` to be greater than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute again.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1 for the loop to execute one more time**
