Example Answer:
The value of `t[j]` is assigned the previous value of `temp`. The value of `ans` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `ans` is increased by 3, `temp` holds the previous value of `t[j]`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 3, `temp` holds the previous value of `t[j]**.
