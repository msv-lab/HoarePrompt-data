Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The value of `j` and `t` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `temp` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `ans` is increased by 3, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 3, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]**
