Example Answer:
The value of `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`, meaning it gets updated with the value of `t[j]`. The value of `temp` is assigned the previous value of `t[j + 1]`, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` retains the value of `t[j + 1]`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` retains the value of `t[j + 1]**.
