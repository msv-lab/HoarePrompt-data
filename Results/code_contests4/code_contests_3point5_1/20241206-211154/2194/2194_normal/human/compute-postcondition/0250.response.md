According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n - 2`. Since the program state remains the same after the loop finishes executing, we can infer that `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n - 2`. Additionally, since the loop starts at `i`, `j` should be equal to `i` at the beginning of the loop.
State: **`i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is equal to `i` for the loop to execute**.
