Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations, `i` is n-2, there is no occurrence of '5' in the modified list `t`, `j` is equal to n, `temp` is the value at index `n` in the modified list `t`, `t[n-1]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[n]` is now equal to `temp` for the loop to execute. Additionally, when the condition is met, `t[i]` is equal to '7'***
