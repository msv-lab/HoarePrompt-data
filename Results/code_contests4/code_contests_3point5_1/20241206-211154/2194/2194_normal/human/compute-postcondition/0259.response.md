Example Answer:
The value of `t[j]` is assigned the value stored in `temp`. The variable `ans` is not affected by this operation. The output state is: variable `ans` is increased by 1; the value at index `j + 1` in list `t` is assigned to `temp`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 1; the value at index `j + 1` in list `t` is assigned to `temp`**
