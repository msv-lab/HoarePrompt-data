Postcondition: ***`ans` is increased by 2 times, `temp` retains the value of `t[j]`, the first element of `t` is still '0', for the loop to execute `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is less than `n - 2`, and `t[i]` is not equal to '0'. If `t[i]` is not equal to '0', the loop breaks out, otherwise no changes occur.***
