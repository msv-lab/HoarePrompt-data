Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-3`, there is no occurrence of '5' in the modified list `t`, `j` is equal to `n`, `temp` is the value at index `n` in the modified list `t`, `t[n-1]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[n]` is now equal to `temp`, `t[i]` is not equal to '7' for the loop to execute one more time. The program state remains the same after the if statement executes.***
