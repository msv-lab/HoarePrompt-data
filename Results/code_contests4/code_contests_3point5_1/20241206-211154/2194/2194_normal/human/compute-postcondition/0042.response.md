Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated based on conditions and incremented by `n - 2 - i`, `cnt` is adjusted and incremented by 1, `i` is decremented by 1, and `t[i]` meets conditions for the loop to execute another iteration. If cnt == 1, the program updates `ans` by `n - 2 - i`, adjusts `cnt`, increments it by 1, decrements `i` by 1, and ensures `t[i]` fulfills loop conditions to continue iteration.***
