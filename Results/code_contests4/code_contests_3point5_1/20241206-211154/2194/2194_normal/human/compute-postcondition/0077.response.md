Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 2, `t` has been modified such that `t[j + 1]` is now equal to `t[j]`, `s` is a string input, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `five` is the count of '5' in `s`, `two` is the count of '2' in `s`, `seven` is the count of '7' in `s`, `fin` is assigned the value 10^18, `zero` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0', `cnt` is 2, `two` is greater than or equal to 1, `five` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is 4, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the third time, `temp` is assigned the value `t[j + 1]`, `ans` is incremented by 1**
