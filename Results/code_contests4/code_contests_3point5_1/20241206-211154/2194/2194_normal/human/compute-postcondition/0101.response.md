Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `ans` is incremented by 2. Therefore, after execution, `ans` is incremented by 3. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `temp`, and the elements in list `t` are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2', `j` is `n - 4`, `ans` is incremented by 3, `temp` is the element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, the element at index `j + 1` in list `t` is now the same as the element at index `j`**
