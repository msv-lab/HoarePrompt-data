Example Answer: 
The loop breaks out of the current iteration and continues in reverse order until reaching the element at index `i-1`. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop behavior is altered. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, the variables maintain their previous values. The loop continues in reverse order until reaching the element at index `i-1`.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, the variables maintain their previous values. The loop continues in reverse order until reaching the element at index `i-1`.**
