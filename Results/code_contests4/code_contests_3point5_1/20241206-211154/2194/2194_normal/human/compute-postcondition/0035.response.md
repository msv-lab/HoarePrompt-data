Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated based on conditions and incremented by `n - 1 - i`, `cnt` is adjusted, `i` is decremented by 1, and `t[i]` meets conditions for the loop to execute another iteration. If `cnt` == 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1. If `cnt` == 1, then `ans` is incremented by `n - 2 - i`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `i` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
