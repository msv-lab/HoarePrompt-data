According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the element at index `i` in the list `t`. If the element at index `i` is not equal to '2', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is `t[n - 1]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the element at index `i` in list `t` must not be equal to '2'. In order to continue the loop, `i` should be decremented by 1.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is `t[n - 1]`, for the loop to execute the third time, the element at index `i` in list `t` must not be equal to '2'**
