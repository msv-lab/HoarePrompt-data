Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t` and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`, `temp` is `t[n - 1]`, for the loop to execute the second time, the element at index `i` in list `t` must not be equal to '2'. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is '2', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
