According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 3`. At the end of the last iteration, n is at least 6, i is the index of the first occurrence of '2', j is n - 3, ans is incremented by n - i + 1, temp is the element at index j in list t, the element at index j in list t is now the same as the element at index j - 1, the first element of list t is '0', and n is not equal to 3. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next index.
- Update `j` to be the new `n - 3` value.
- Increment `ans` by `n - i + 1`.
- Update `temp` to be the element at the new index `j`.
- Set the element at index `j` in list `t` to be the same as the element at index `j - 1`.

State: **n is the length of list t and is at least 6, i is the index of the next occurrence of '2', j is the new n - 3, ans is incremented by the new n - i + 1, temp is the element at the new index j in list t, the element at the new index j in list t is now the same as the element at the new index j - 1, the first element of list t is '0', n is not equal to 3**
