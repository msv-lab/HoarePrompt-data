Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions specified, `cnt` is adjusted, `i` is decremented by 1, and `t[i]` meets the conditions specified for the loop to execute another iteration. If cnt == 1, then `ans` is incremented by `n - 2 - i`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `i` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
