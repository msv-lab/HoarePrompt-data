Example Answer:
The value of `t[j]` is assigned to `t[j + 1]`, which means `t[j + 1]` now holds the previous value of `t[j]`. The value of `temp` was assigned the value of `t[j + 1]` earlier, so now `temp` holds the previous value of `t[j]`. Since `ans` was increased by 3 earlier and `temp` is now holding the previous value of `t[j]`, the Output State is: variable `ans` is increased by 3, `temp` holds the previous value of `t[j]`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 3, `temp` holds the previous value of `t[j]**
