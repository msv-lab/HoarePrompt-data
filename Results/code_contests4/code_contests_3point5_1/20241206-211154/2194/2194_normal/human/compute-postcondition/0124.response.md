Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2', `j` is `n - 2`, `ans` is incremented by `n - i`, `temp` is the element at index `j` in list `t`, the element at index `j` in list `t` is now the same as the element at index `j - 1`, the first element of list `t` is '0'. If `n` == 3, `ans` is assigned the value 10^15. If `n` is at least 6, `i` is the index of the next occurrence of '2' or `n`, `j` is the new `n - 3`, `ans` is incremented by the number of times '0' appears consecutively at the beginning of list `t` before any other element. If `t[i]` is not '0', the element at the new index `j` in list `t` is now the same as the element at the new index `j - 1`.***
