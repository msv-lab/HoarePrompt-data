Example Answer: 
The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The previous value of `ans` is increased by 1, but it is not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`**
