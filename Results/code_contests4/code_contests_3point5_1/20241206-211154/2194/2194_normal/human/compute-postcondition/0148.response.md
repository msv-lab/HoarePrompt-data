According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is -1, `ans` is 1, there is no occurrence of '5' in list `t`, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the value at index `j` in list `t`, and the value at index `j` in list `t` is assigned to `t[j]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is -1, there is no occurrence of '5' in list `t`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the value at index `j` in list `t`. The value at index `j` in list `t` is assigned to `t[j]`.**
