You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an integer n from 1 to 10^{18} without leading zeroes.

In one move you can swap any two adjacent digits in the given number in such a way that the resulting number will not contain leading zeroes. In other words, after each move the number you have cannot contain any leading zeroes.

What is the minimum number of moves you have to make to obtain a number that is divisible by 25? Print -1 if it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 25.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}). It is guaranteed that the first (left) digit of the number n is not a zero.

Output

If it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 25, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of moves required to obtain such number.

Note that you can swap only adjacent digits in the given number.

Examples

Input

5071


Output

4


Input

705


Output

1


Input

1241367


Output

-1

Note

In the first example one of the possible sequences of moves is 5071 → 5701 → 7501 → 7510 → 7150.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

If `zero` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0'`, and `cnt` is 2. If `two` is greater than or equal to 1 and `five` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`. In the if block, `ans` is increased by `(n - i - 2)` times, `temp` retains the value of `t[j]` after the last iteration. The first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is equal to 3, then `ans` is 10^15. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the number of times `t[i]` is equal to '0' in `t`. `temp` retains the value of the last element of `t`. For the loop to execute `n` is not equal to 3. If `t[i]` is not equal to '0', the loop breaks out. `fin` is assigned the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`.
        if (fin > 10 ** 10) :

        else :

If `zero` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n - 1 - i` for all `i` such that `t[i] == '0'`, and `cnt` is 2.

Otherwise, the function does not print anything.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
