Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads a string input, calculates the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25, and then prints the result. The program follows the rules specified in the problem description, such as swapping adjacent digits to achieve the desired result. The program handles different cases based on the occurrences of '0', '2', '5', and '7' in the input string, and adjusts the final result accordingly. The program also correctly handles cases where it is impossible to obtain a number divisible by 25.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
