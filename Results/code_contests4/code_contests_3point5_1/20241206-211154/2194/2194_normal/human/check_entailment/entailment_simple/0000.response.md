Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description and calculates the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number divisible by 25. The program considers all possible cases where swapping adjacent digits can lead to a number divisible by 25 and calculates the minimum number of moves accordingly. It also handles cases where it is impossible to obtain a number divisible by 25 by returning -1.

The program iterates through the input number and performs swaps to create new numbers and checks if they are divisible by 25. It keeps track of the minimum number of moves required to achieve a number divisible by 25 and updates this value as it goes through the iterations.

Overall, the program implements the logic described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
