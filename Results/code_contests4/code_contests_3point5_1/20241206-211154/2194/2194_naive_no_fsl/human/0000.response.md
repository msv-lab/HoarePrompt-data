Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25. It considers all possible cases where swapping adjacent digits can lead to a number divisible by 25. The program handles cases where the given number contains specific digits like '0', '2', '5', and '7' and performs the necessary swaps to achieve a number divisible by 25. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where it is impossible to obtain a number divisible by 25 and prints -1 in such situations. The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description, and for all test cases provided in the examples, the program produces the correct output.
