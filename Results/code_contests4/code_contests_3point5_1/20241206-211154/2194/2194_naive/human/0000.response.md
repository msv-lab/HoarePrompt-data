Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25. It considers all possible combinations of swapping adjacent digits that would lead to a number divisible by 25. The program also handles cases where it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 25 by returning -1. The logic and conditions used in the program seem to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
