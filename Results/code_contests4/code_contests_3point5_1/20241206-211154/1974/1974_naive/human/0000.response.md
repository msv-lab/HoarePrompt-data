Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It first reads the input values, processes them to move the statues according to the rules, and then checks if the final arrangement matches the desired arrangement. The program outputs "YES" if the rearrangement can be done and "NO" otherwise. 

After analyzing the program and the problem description, it can be concluded that the program handles all potential cases and scenarios as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
