Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program does not actually move the statues from one island to another as required. Instead, it manipulates the input strings in a way that does not represent the statue rearrangement process described in the problem.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct solution.
