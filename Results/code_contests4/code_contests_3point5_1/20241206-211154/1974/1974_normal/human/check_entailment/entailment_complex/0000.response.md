Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes the input values, performs string manipulation operations as required by the problem, and then checks if the modified string is equal to the original string to determine if the rearrangement can be done.

The program handles all cases where the rearrangement can be done and outputs "YES". It also correctly handles cases where the rearrangement is not possible and outputs "NO". Therefore, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all scenarios.
