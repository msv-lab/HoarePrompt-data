Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function performs string manipulation to rearrange the statues on the islands. However, the code may not work correctly for all scenarios. One such example is when the desired statues cannot be rearranged due to the structure of the island network, resulting in an incorrect output.
