Functionality: **The function `func` takes user input for a positive integer `n`, two lists `ai` and `bi` of length `n`, and performs string manipulation operations on the input strings `f` and `s`. It then checks if the modified string `s` is equal to the original string `f`, and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' otherwise. The function does not have a return value.** 

Potential Edge Cases:
- The function does not handle invalid inputs for `n`, `ai`, and `bi`.
- There is no error handling for cases where the input strings result in unexpected behavior during manipulation.
- The function does not provide any feedback if the strings `f` and `s` are not equal for reasons other than the manipulation performed.
