Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The values of `ai` and `bi` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200000, ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n-1 and distinct.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200000, ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n-1 and distinct**
