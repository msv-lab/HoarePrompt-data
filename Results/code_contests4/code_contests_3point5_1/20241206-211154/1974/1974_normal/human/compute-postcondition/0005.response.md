Example Answer: 
`ff` is assigned the value of the second character of the string `f`, which has spaces added before and after the input. The value of `ff` will be the character at index 1 of the input string after spaces are removed. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200000, ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n-1 and distinct, f is a string with spaces added before and after the input, s is a modified string after replacing ' 0 ' with ' ', ff is a character extracted from f.
