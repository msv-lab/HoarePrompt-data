Example Answer:
The `find()` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the character `ff` in the string `s`. The variable `ss` is assigned this index value. If `ff` is not found in `s`, then `ss` will be assigned -1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200000, ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n-1 and distinct, f is a string with spaces added before and after the input, s is a modified string after replacing ' 0 ' with ' ', ff is a character extracted from f, ss is the index of ff in s or -1 if ff is not found.
