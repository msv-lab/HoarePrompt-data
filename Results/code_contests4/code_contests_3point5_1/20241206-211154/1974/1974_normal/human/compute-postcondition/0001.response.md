Example Answer:
The code snippet reads an input string, adds spaces before and after the input string, and assigns it to the variable `f`. The variables `n`, `ai`, and `bi` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200000, ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n-1 and distinct, f is a string with spaces added before and after the input.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200000, ai and bi are lists of integers with length n, where each element is in the range from 0 to n-1 and distinct, f is a string with spaces added before and after the input**
