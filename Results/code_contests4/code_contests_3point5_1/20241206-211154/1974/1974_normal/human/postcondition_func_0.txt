The function `func` takes user input for a positive integer `n`, two lists `ai` and `bi` of length `n`, and performs string manipulation operations on the input strings `f` and `s`. It then checks if the modified string `s` is equal to the original string `f`, and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' otherwise. The function does not have a return value.
