Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles the input by parsing the integers and replacing the '0's with spaces. It then finds the first statue to be moved and rearranges the desired order of statues accordingly. Finally, it checks if the rearranged order matches the initial order, and prints "YES" if they match, and "NO" otherwise. The logic seems to be in line with the problem description, and the examples provided also give the correct output.
