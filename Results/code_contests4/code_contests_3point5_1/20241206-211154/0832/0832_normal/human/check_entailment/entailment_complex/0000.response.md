Correctness: True

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes input values for n, m, and k, and then calculates the final position of Lara based on the number of movements k. The program follows the specified path for Lara's movements and correctly calculates the final cell where Lara ends up after k moves. It also handles the case where k - n <= -1 as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
