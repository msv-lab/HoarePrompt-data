Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user input.
- It then calculates new values for `y` and `x` based on the inputs and the given conditions.
- The code handles the case where `k - n <= -1` by printing `y` and `k + 1` without further calculations.
- It correctly determines the final position of Lara after she moves `k` times based on the provided path in the problem description.
- The calculated values of `y` and `x` are printed as the final output.

The code seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also align with the code logic. Therefore, the correctness of the code is considered to be True.
