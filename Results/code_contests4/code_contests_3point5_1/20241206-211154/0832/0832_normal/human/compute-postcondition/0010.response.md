Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 109; `k` is a non-negative integer less than n*m; `x` is 1, `y` is 1; if k - n <= -1, then the value of `k` is less than `n`, the value of `m` is unchanged, and the program has exited using `sys.exit()` without printing `y` and `k + 1; `t` is assigned the value of k divided by (m - 1); `p` is assigned the value of k modulo (m - 1); `y` is assigned the value of n - t**
