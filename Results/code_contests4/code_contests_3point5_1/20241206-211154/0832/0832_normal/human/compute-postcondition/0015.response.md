Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers n, m, and k from the user input. It then performs calculations based on these inputs to determine new values for y and x. The function prints the values of y and x after the computations. If k - n is less than or equal to -1, the function prints y and k + 1 without performing further calculations and exits the program. The function does not return any value. **
