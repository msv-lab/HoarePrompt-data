Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned by mapping the input to integers. Since `n` and `m` are even integers within the specified range, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m`, the output state will be:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 109; `k` is a non-negative integer less than n*m**
