Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 109; `k` is a non-negative integer less than n*m; `x` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 109; `k` is a non-negative integer less than n*m; `x` is 1**
