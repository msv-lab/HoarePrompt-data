Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy to one of the chessboard corners. It considers all possible corner positions and calculates the minimum moves required based on the conditions given in the problem description. The program also handles cases where Inna and the pony cannot get the candy to the corner following Dima's rules by printing "Poor Inna and pony!" as required. 

The program uses bitwise operations and loops to efficiently calculate the minimum moves needed. It covers all possible scenarios and conditions mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
