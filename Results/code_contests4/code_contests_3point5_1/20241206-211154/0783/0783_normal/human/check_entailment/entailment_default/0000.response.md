Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input integers n, m, i, j, a, b and calculates the minimum number of moves required to move the candy to the chessboard corners based on Dima's rules.
- The code iterates through the corner positions (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1) and calculates the distance between the current position of the candy and each corner.
- It then checks if the candy can reach a corner by following Dima's rules, considering the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
- If the candy can reach a corner, it calculates the minimum number of moves required and updates the minimum value.
- Finally, it prints the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy, or "Poor Inna and pony!" if the candy cannot reach any corner.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases, ensuring that the candy can only be moved within the chessboard borders and following Dima's rules.
