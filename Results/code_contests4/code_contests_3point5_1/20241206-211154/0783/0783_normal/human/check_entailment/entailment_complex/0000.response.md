Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach one of the corner cells of the chessboard, and outputs the result. The program handles the conditions specified in the problem description, such as moving the candy within the chessboard borders and checking for the minimum number of moves required. The final output message "Poor Inna and pony!" is printed only when the conditions are met as described in the problem. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
