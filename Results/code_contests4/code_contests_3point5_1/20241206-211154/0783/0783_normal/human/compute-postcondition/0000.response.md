Example Answer:
`n, m, x, y, a, b` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. The values of `n, m, i, j, a, b` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, i, j, a, b` are all integers such that 1 <= n, m, i, j, a, b <= 10^6.
Output State: **`n, m, i, j, a, b` are all integers such that 1 <= n, m, i, j, a, b <= 10^6.**
