According to the code, the loop will iterate over a list of tuples containing coordinates. In each iteration, `c` will be updated to a new coordinate. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are tuples left in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `m` are integers within the specified range. `c` has been updated to a new coordinate. `dx` and `dy` have been calculated based on the new coordinate. `v` has been updated based on the conditions specified.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the list needs to be considered. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are as follows:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. `c` is updated to the new coordinate, `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`, `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop**
