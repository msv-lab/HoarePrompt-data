Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. `c` is updated to the new coordinate. `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`. `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop. The if block checks if dx is divisible by a, dy is divisible by b, and the parity of dx/a is the same as dy/b. If all these conditions are met, then `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop.***
