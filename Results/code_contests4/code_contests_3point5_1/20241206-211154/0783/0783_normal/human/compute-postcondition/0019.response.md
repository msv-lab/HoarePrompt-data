According to the code, the loop iterates over a list of tuples containing coordinates. The loop executes based on the values of `n` and `m`, and the conditions specified for updating `v`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. After the execution of the if-else block, `c` is updated to the new coordinate. `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`. `v` is updated based on certain conditions.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next coordinate in the list [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)] and adjust the states accordingly. 

Since the loop iterates over the list of coordinates, the next coordinate `(c)` will be the next tuple in the list after the last iteration. 

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. After the execution of the if-else block, `c` is updated to the new coordinate, `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`, `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop, and the loop will execute again with the next coordinate in the list [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)].**
