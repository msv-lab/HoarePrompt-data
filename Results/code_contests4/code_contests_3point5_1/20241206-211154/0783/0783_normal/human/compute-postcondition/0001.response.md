Example Answer:
`v` is assigned the value of 1 shifted left by 60 bits, which is a very large integer. The values of other variables `n, m, i, j, a, b` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, i, j, a, b` are all integers such that 1 <= n, m, i, j, a, b <= 10^6 and `v` is a very large integer.
Output State: **`n, m, i, j, a, b` are all integers such that 1 <= n, m, i, j, a, b <= 10^6 and `v` is a very large integer**
