Postcondition: ***n, m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; dx is the absolute difference between the current x coordinate and the first element of the new coordinate c; dy is the absolute difference between the current y coordinate and the second element of the new coordinate c. If 0 == dx + dy, v remains 0. Otherwise, v is updated to the minimum between its current value and the maximum of the integer division results of dx by a and dy by b.***
