According to the code, the loop will execute for each tuple in the list [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]. Therefore, the loop will execute 4 times. The values of `n` and `m` are important for the loop to execute. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the values of `n` and `m` should be such that the loop can iterate through all the tuples in the list. Additionally, the loop variable `c` will take on the values of the tuples in the list, so `c` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6, `c` is updated for each iteration of the loop**
