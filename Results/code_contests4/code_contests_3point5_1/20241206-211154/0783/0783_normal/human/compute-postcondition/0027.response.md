Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. `v` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The final value of `v` will be the minimum value obtained from all iterations of the loop. If `v` and (max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b) is true***
