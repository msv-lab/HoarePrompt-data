Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. After the execution of the if-else block, `c` is updated to the new coordinate. `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`. `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop. If dx + dy equals 0, `v` is 0. Otherwise, the if block checks if dx is divisible by a, dy is divisible by b, and the parity of dx/a is the same as dy/b. If all these conditions are met, then `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop.***
