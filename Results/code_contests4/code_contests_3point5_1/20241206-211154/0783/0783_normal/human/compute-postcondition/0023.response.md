Example Answer:
The value of `v` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the maximum of the division result of `dx` by `a` and `dy` by `b`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are the absolute differences between the current x and y coordinates and the first and second elements of the new coordinate `c` respectively. Since `n` and `m` are integers, `a` and `b` are also integers. Therefore, `dx / a` and `dy / b` will yield integer results as well. As a result, `v` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of these integer results. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; `dx` is the absolute difference between the current x coordinate and the first element of the new coordinate `c`; `dy` is the absolute difference between the current y coordinate and the second element of the new coordinate `c`; `v` is updated to the minimum between its current value and the maximum of the integer division results of `dx` by `a` and `dy` by `b`**
