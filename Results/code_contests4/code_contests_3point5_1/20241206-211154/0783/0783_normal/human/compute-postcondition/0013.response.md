Example Answer:
`dx` is assigned the absolute difference between the x-coordinate of `c` and `x`. The values of `x` and `c` are not given, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. `c` is updated to the new coordinate, `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`, `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. `c` is updated to the new coordinate, `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`, `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop**
