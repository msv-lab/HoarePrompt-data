Example Answer:
The absolute difference between the value of `x` and the first element of the list `c` is calculated and stored in `dx`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `c` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6, `c` is updated for each iteration of the loop, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`**
