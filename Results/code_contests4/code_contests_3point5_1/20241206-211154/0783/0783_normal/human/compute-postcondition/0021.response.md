Example Answer:
`dy` is assigned the absolute difference between the current y coordinate and the second element of the new coordinate `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `dx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; `dx` is the absolute difference between the current x coordinate and the first element of the new coordinate `c`; `dy` is the absolute difference between the current y coordinate and the second element of the new coordinate `c`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; `dx` is the absolute difference between the current x coordinate and the first element of the new coordinate `c`; `dy` is the absolute difference between the current y coordinate and the second element of the new coordinate `c`**
