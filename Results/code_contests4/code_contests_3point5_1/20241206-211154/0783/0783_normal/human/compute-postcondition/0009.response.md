Example Answer:
`v` is updated to the minimum value between the current `v` and the maximum value between `dx/a` and `dy/b`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are dependent on the absolute differences between `x` and `c[0]` and `y` and `c[1]` respectively. The conditions ensure that `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the remainders of the divisions are equal. Therefore, `v` will be updated based on these calculations.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6, `c` is updated for each iteration of the loop, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`, `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and `c[1]`. The condition (0 != dx + dy) is true. `dx` is divisible by `a`, `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the remainders of the divisions of `dx/a` and `dy/b` are equal. `v` is updated to the minimum value between the current `v` and the maximum value between `dx/a` and `dy/b`.**
