Example Answer:
The variable `v` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6. `c` is updated for each iteration of the loop. `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`, `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and `c[1]`. The sum of `dx` and `dy` is equal to 0. `v` is 0**
