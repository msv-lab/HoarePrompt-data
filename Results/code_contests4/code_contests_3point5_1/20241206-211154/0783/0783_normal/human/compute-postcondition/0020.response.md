Example Answer:
`dx` is assigned the absolute difference between the current x coordinate and the first element of the coordinate `c`. Since the initial state of `x` is unknown, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; `dx` is the absolute difference between the current x coordinate and the first element of the new coordinate `c`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; `dx` is the absolute difference between the current x coordinate and the first element of the new coordinate `c`**
