Example Answer:
`dy` is assigned the absolute difference between the current value of `y` and the second element of the coordinate `c`. Since the initial state values of `y` and `c` are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact value of `dy`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6, `c` is updated to the new coordinate, `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`, `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6, `c` is updated to the new coordinate, `dx` and `dy` are calculated based on the new `c`, `v` is updated based on the conditions specified for the next iteration of the loop**
