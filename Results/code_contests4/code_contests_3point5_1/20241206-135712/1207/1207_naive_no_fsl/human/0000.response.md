Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the area of a star figure given the number of corners (n) and the radius of the circumcircle (r). The formula used in the program is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem description provided. Additionally, the program imports the math module to use mathematical functions which ensures accurate calculations. For all valid inputs within the specified ranges, the program will output the correct area of the star figure.
