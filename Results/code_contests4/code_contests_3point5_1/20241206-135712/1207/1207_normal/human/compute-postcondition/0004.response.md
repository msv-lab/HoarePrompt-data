The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The output of the function is as follows:
- If the prime number `n` is greater than or equal to 5 and the positive integer `r` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns the result of a specific calculation based on `n` and `r`.
- If the constraints on `n` and `r` are not met, the function may return an error message or handle the input appropriately.
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates a specific result based on the prime number `n` and the positive integer `r` if the constraints are met. Otherwise, it may return an error message or handle the input appropriately.**
