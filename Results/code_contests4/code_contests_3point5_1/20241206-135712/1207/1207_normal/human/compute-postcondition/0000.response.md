Example Answer:
`n` and `r` are assigned values by splitting the input string into integers. Since `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, and `r` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the values of `n` and `r` are based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
