Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program is missing the import statement for the `math` module which is required for the mathematical operations in the code. This will lead to a NameError when trying to access functions from the `math` module.

2. There is a syntax error in the calculation of `ans` due to an incomplete expression. The `math` module is used but not imported, so the program will encounter a NameError.

3. The program does not calculate the area of a star as described in the problem description. The calculation in the code snippet is incomplete and does not match the formula provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description.
