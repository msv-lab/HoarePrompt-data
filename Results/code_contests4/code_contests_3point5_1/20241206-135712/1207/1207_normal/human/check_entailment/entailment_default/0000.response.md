Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly calculates the area of a star figure based on the input values of the number of corners and the radius of the circumcircle. The formula used in the code aligns with the problem description, as it involves mathematical operations using the input values to determine the area of the star. The code imports the necessary `math` module to perform trigonometric calculations. Additionally, the output of the code is a single number representing the area of the star, meeting the requirements of the problem description. 

Since the code accurately implements the formula described in the problem statement and there are no edge cases mentioned that are not handled by the code, we can conclude that the code is correct.
