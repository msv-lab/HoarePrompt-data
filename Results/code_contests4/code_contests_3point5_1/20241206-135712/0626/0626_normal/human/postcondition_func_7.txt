The function `func_8` recursively processes a tree-like structure represented by `node` and `parent`. It iterates through the children nodes of `node`, removing the last occurrence where a child node is equal to the parent node from the list of children nodes. The function does not have a specific return value mentioned, so the final state of the tree structure depends on the execution of the function.
