The function func_7 accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the result of dividing 'a' by the return value of func_6(a, b), then multiplies this result by 'b' and returns the final value. However, there is a missing implementation detail for func_6 which could affect the functionality if not handled correctly.
