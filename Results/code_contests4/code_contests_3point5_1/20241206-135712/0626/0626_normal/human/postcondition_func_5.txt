The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is a list of integers with length n such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, and parameter `b` is an integer. The function calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b` and returns it. If `b` is 0, it returns the greatest common divisor. However, there is a potential issue with the code logic as the current implementation may not handle the case where `b` is not 0 properly.
