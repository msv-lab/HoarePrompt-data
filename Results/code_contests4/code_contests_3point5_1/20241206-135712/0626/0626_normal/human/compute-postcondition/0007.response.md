Example Answer:
`lcm` is assigned the result of calling `func_7` with arguments `lcm` and `child[0]`. The previous value of `lcm` is 1, and the value of `child[0]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` with the given arguments.
Output State: **`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` with the given arguments**
