Example Answer: 
`t` is assigned the value of `child[1]` divided by `lcm` and multiplied by `lcm`. The value of `t` is dependent on the specific values of `child[1]` and `lcm`. If `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`, `max` is updated to the value of `t`. The loop will execute one more time if there are more children in `node[2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, `max` is updated to the value of `t` if `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`, loop executes one more time if there are more children in `node[2]`.
Output State: **`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, `max` is updated to the value of `t` if `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`, loop executes one more time if there are more children in `node[2]`**
