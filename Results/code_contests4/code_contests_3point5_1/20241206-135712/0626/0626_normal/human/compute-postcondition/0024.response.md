According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `node[2]`. If there are more children in the list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`. `max` is updated to the value of `t` if `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`. `max` is updated to the value of `t` if `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more children in `node[2]`.**
