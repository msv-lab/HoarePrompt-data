Postcondition: ***`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, there is at least 1 child node in `node[2]` to iterate over. If `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`, then `max` is updated to the value of `t`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
