Example Answer:
`max` is assigned the value of `t`. If `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`, then `max` is updated to the value of `t`. The previous values of `max`, `lcm`, and `t` are unknown, so the output state is: `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, `max` is updated to the value of `t` if `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`.
Output State: **`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, `max` is updated to the value of `t` if `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`**
