According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `node[2]`. If there is at least one child node in `node[2]`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, and `max` may have been updated to the value of `t`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Verify if there is at least one child node in `node[2]` for the loop to continue.
- If `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`, update `max` to the value of `t`.

State: **`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, there is at least 1 child node in `node[2] to iterate over. If `max` was less than 0 or greater than `t`, then `max` is updated to the value of `t`**.
