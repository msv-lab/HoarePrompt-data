According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the node[2]. If node[2] is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, lcm is 1 and max is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to node[2] is not empty. 
State: **`lcm` is 1, `max` is -1, for the loop to execute node[2] is not empty**
