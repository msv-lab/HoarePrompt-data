Functionality: **The function `func_9` processes the input parameters related to a tree structure represented by a `node`. The `node` parameter is an integer within the range 2 to 10^5. The function iterates over the children nodes in `node[2]`, calculates the least common multiple (`lcm`) based on the result of `func_7`, and updates the maximum value (`max`) based on calculations involving `lcm`. The function then assigns the calculated `lcm` to `node[0]` and the product of `max` and the number of children in `node[2]` to `node[1]`. The function does not return anything. The annotations mention the input parameters and tree structure but don't accurately reflect the calculation and assignment operations performed by the function.**
