According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the child nodes in `node[2]`. If there are child nodes present in `node[2]`, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child and there are no more child nodes left in `node[2]` to iterate over. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to update it so that there is at least one child node in `node[2]` for the loop to iterate over. Additionally, `lcm` should reflect the updated value after executing `func_7` for the child node, and `max` should remain -1.
State: **`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2] and there is at least 1 child node in `node[2]` to iterate over, `max` remains -1**
