Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the result of `child[1]` divided by `lcm`, multiplied by `lcm`. Since `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, and there is at least 1 child node in `node[2]` to iterate over, the exact value of `lcm` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2] (specific value unknown), there is at least 1 child node in `node[2]` to iterate over; `max` remains -1.
Output State: **`lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2] (specific value unknown), there is at least 1 child node in `node[2]` to iterate over; `max` remains -1**
