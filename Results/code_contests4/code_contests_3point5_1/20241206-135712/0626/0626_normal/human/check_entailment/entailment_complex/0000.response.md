Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the annotations, it appears that the functions are correctly implemented to handle the problem described. The functions are designed to process a rooted tree with n vertices, calculate the minimum number of apples that need to be removed to balance the tree, and handle the tree structure as specified in the problem description. The functions cover cases such as finding the least common multiple, processing children nodes, updating values based on calculations, and ensuring the tree is balanced. The annotations and the code align with the problem description, and there are no apparent discrepancies or missing logic that would cause the program to deviate from the specified requirements. Therefore, the code is deemed correct.
