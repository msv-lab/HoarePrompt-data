Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The `func_9` function is supposed to count the minimum number of apples that need to be removed from the tree to make it balanced, but it does not handle all cases correctly. The function calculates the least common multiple (`lcm`) and then updates the maximum value (`max`) based on calculations involving `lcm`. However, the logic for determining the minimum number of apples to remove is flawed. There is a missing implementation detail for `func_6` which could affect the functionality if not handled correctly. Additionally, the code does not account for all edge cases where the tree might not be balanced, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
