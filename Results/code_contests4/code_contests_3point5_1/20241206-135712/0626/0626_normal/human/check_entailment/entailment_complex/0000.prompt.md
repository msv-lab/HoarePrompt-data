You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. In each leaf vertex there's a single integer — the number of apples in this vertex. 

The weight of a subtree is the sum of all numbers in this subtree leaves. For instance, the weight of a subtree that corresponds to some leaf is the number written in the leaf.

A tree is balanced if for every vertex v of the tree all its subtrees, corresponding to the children of vertex v, are of equal weight. 

Count the minimum number of apples that you need to remove from the tree (specifically, from some of its leaves) in order to make the tree balanced. Notice that you can always achieve the goal by just removing all apples.

Input

The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105), showing the number of vertices in the tree. The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 108), ai is the number of apples in the vertex number i. The number of apples in non-leaf vertices is guaranteed to be zero. 

Then follow n - 1 lines, describing the tree edges. Each line contains a pair of integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi) — the vertices connected by an edge. 

The vertices are indexed from 1 to n. Vertex 1 is the root.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the sin, cout streams cin, cout or the %I64d specifier.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.**
def func_1(n):
    return [raw_input().strip() for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n strings where n is an integer between 2 and 10^5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts an integer n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, and returns a list of n strings obtained by stripping input from the user.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8 for each 1 <= i <= n.**
def func_2():
    return raw_input().strip()
    #The program returns the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8 for 1 <= i <= n.**
def func_3():
    return map(int, func_2().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after applying the int function to the result of splitting the output of func_2().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It internally calls another function `func_2` and processes its output. The output of `func_2` is split and then the `int` function is applied to each element. The function `func_3` returns a map object containing these processed integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 105. ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8. xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi.**
def func_4():
    return func_3()[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the output of function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_3()` and returns the first element of its output.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8 for i from 1 to n, and the number of apples in non-leaf vertices is zero. The tree edges are described by pairs of integers xi, yi where 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi ≠ yi. Vertex 1 is the root.**
def func_5(o):
    print(o)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `o` and prints the value of `o`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The parameter `ai` is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8 for i from 1 to n. The number of apples in non-leaf vertices is zero. The tree edges are described by pairs of integers xi, yi where 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi ≠ yi. Vertex 1 is the root. The function does not have a specified return value.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. a is a list of integers with length n such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8.**
def func_6(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a %= b
        
        a, b = b, a
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` and `b` hold the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is a list of integers with length n such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, and parameter `b` is an integer. The function calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b` and returns it. If `b` is 0, it returns the greatest common divisor. However, there is a potential issue with the code logic as the current implementation may not handle the case where `b` is not 0 properly.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. a1, a2, ..., an are integers such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8. The input represents a rooted tree with n vertices where the number of apples in non-leaf vertices is zero.**
def func_7(a, b):
    return a / func_6(a, b) * b
    #The program returns the result of dividing the value of 'a' by the result of calling function func_6 with 'a' and 'b' as parameters, then multiplying the result by the value of 'b'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the result of dividing 'a' by the return value of func_6(a, b), then multiplies this result by 'b' and returns the final value. However, there is a missing implementation detail for func_6 which could affect the functionality if not handled correctly.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, and xi, yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi.**
def func_8(node, parent):
    ii = -1
    for i in range(len(node[2])):
        if node[2][i] != parent:
            func_8(node[2][i], node)
        else:
            ii = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi, ii is the index of the last occurrence where node[2][i] is equal to parent or -1 if no such occurrence happened during the loop execution.
    if (ii >= 0) :
        node[2].pop(ii)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi. If ii >= 0, the last occurrence where node[2][i] is equal to parent has been removed from the node[2] list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` recursively processes a tree-like structure represented by `node` and `parent`. It iterates through the children nodes of `node`, removing the last occurrence where a child node is equal to the parent node from the list of children nodes. The function does not have a specific return value mentioned, so the final state of the tree structure depends on the execution of the function.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The list a contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8. Each pair of integers xi, yi in the following n-1 lines represents valid edges in the tree.**
def func_9(node):
    if (node[1] >= 0) :
        return
        #The program does not return anything
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The list a contains n integers where 0 <= ai <= 10^8. Each pair of integers xi, yi in the following n-1 lines represents valid edges in the tree. The first node does not have a value less than 0
    lcm = 1
    max = -1
    for child in node[2]:
        func_9(child)
        
        lcm = func_7(lcm, child[0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2] and there are no more child nodes left in `node[2]` to iterate over, `max` remains -1
    for child in node[2]:
        t = child[1] / lcm * lcm
        
        if max < 0 or max > t:
            max = t
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_7` for each child in `node[2]`, `max` is updated to the maximum value of `t` calculated in each iteration of the loop, loop iterates over all children in `node[2]`
    node[0] = lcm
    node[1] = max * len(node[2])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` processes the input parameters related to a tree structure represented by a `node`. The `node` parameter is an integer within the range 2 to 10^5. The function iterates over the children nodes in `node[2]`, calculates the least common multiple (`lcm`) based on the result of `func_7`, and updates the maximum value (`max`) based on calculations involving `lcm`. The function then assigns the calculated `lcm` to `node[0]` and the product of `max` and the number of children in `node[2]` to `node[1]`. The function does not return anything. The annotations mention the input parameters and tree structure but don't accurately reflect the calculation and assignment operations performed by the function.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
