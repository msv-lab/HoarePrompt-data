Correctness: **True**

The program defines functions that handle input parsing, tree traversal, and calculations according to the problem description. It correctly computes the minimum number of apples that need to be removed from the tree to make it balanced. The functions follow the problem description and work together to achieve the desired outcome. 

Each function is annotated to describe its purpose and the state of the program before and after its execution. The functions handle tree traversal, calculating the least common multiple, and updating the nodes of the tree to store the necessary information for the final calculation.

Overall, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and implements the required logic to determine the minimum number of apples to remove to balance the tree.
