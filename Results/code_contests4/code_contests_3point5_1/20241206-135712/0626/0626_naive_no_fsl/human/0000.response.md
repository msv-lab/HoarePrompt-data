Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, calculates the minimum number of apples to remove to balance the tree, and prints the output. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description provided. The program considers all vertices in the tree and calculates the minimum number of apples to remove to achieve a balanced tree. The implementation covers all possible cases and works as expected.
