Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input as described in the problem.
2. The program constructs the tree based on the input edges and calculates the minimum number of apples to remove in order to balance the tree.
3. The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to calculate the weight of each subtree and determines the maximum number of apples that can be removed to balance the tree.
4. The program outputs the correct minimum number of apples to remove to balance the tree, which is the sum of all apples minus the maximum number of apples that can be kept to maintain balance.
