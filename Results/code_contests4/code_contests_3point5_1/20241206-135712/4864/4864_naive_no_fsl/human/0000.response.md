Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It hardcodes specific denominations and change amounts based on the value of `n`, which is not allowed according to the problem description. It should be able to generate any valid test case based on the desired number of ways `A`. The program does not provide a generic solution to the problem as described.
