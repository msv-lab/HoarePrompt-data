According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and the length of `nom`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and a specific integer based on input `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `x` should be decremented by 1, so `x` becomes `x-1`.
2. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, then `nom.append(x)` should be executed to add the new value of `x` to the `nom` list.

State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and a specific integer based on input `n`, `x` is `x-1`**
