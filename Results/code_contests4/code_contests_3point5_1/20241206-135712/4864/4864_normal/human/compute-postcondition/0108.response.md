According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `x` is set to 1000000 - 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, `n` is an integer where 10000 < n <= 100000, `res_` is the result of integer division of 1000000 by `res`, `nom` now contains the appended value of `res_`, `x` is 999999**.
