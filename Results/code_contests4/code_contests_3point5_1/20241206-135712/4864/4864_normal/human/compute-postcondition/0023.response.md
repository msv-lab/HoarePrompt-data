According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is within the range from 1000000 - 1 down to 1. Since `x` is being iterated over in reverse, the loop will execute until `x` reaches 1.

For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`, `x` is 1000000 - 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
