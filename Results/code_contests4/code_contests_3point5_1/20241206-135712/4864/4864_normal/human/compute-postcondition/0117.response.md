According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to 0.
State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1 and the integer division of 1000000 by `res`, `nom` now contains the appended value of `res_`, `x` is 0, the length of `nom` is either 11 or n % 10 + 3**
