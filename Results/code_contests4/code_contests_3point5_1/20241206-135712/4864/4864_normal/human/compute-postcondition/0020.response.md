Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. Since `n` is an integer within the range of 11 to 100, `n % 10` will always be the ones digit of `n`. Therefore, `res` will be calculated as the tens digit of `n` minus 1. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, `res` is the tens digit of `n` minus 1**
