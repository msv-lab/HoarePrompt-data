Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 9, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x` added in each iteration. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n`, we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
