According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`, `x` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time, the length of `nom` is less than 10 after appending `x`**
