According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `x`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed once with `x` being 1, and the loop will execute again with `x` being 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` should be 0.
State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`, `x` is 0 for the loop to execute the third time, the length of `nom` is less than 10 after appending `x`**
