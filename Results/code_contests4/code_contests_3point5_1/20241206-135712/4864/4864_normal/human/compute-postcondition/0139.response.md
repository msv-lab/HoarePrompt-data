Functionality: **The function reads an integer input `n` from the standard input and constructs a list `nom` based on certain conditions. If `n` is between 1 and 10, `nom` contains integers in descending order from 1000000 to 1000000 - `n` + 1. If `n` is between 11 and 100, `nom` starts with 1 followed by specific values, and if `n` is between 101 and 1000, `nom` includes 1 and a specific integer based on `n`. For `n` between 1000 and 10000, `nom` is constructed with a length equal to the last digit of `n` plus 2. If `n` is 10000 or 100000, the function prints certain values and exits. The function then prints the change value and the length of `nom`, followed by the elements of `nom`. The function does not have a specific return value.**
