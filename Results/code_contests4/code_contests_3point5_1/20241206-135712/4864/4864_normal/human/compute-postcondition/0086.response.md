Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains integers with updated length, for the loop to execute one more time, the range should not reach 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
