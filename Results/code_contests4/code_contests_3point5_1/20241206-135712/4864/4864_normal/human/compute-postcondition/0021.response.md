Example Answer:
`res_` is assigned the value of `change` divided by `res`, where `change` is 1000000 and `res` is the tens digit of `n` minus 1. The value of `n` is an integer input within the range of 11 to 105, so the tens digit of `n` can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 resulting in different values of `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, and the value of `res_` is dependent on the tens digit of `n` minus 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, and the value of `res_` is dependent on the tens digit of `n` minus 1**
