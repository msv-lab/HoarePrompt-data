Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers. If 100 < n <= 1000, `nom` will contain 1 and a specific integer based on input `n` if n is less than 10, `nom` will have 10 elements starting from 1 to 10. If n is greater than or equal to 10, `nom` will have `n % 10 + 2` elements. If 1000 < n <= 10000, `nom` contains integers with a length equal to the last digit of `n` plus 2. If n is not within the range of 11 to 100 and n is not between 100 and 1000, `nom` contains the integer 1, the integer division of 1000000 by `res`, and the appended value of `res_`, `x` is 0, the length of `nom` is either 11 or n % 10 + 4. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, we break out of the loop. If the length of `nom` is equal to n % 10 + 2, the loop is exited after the execution of the if statement.***
