Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` remains 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`, `x` will be 0 for the loop to execute the third time, and the length of `nom` is less than 10 after appending `x`. If the length of `nom` is 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
