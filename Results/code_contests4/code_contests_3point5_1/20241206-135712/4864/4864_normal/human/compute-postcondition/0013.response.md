According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `x` is within the range from 1 to 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 less than 1000001, `n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 9, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x - 1` added in each iteration. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nom` should have a length less than `n`.
State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 9, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x` added in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time length of `nom` should be less than `n`**
