Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and a specific integer based on input `n`, for the loop to execute `x` is greater than 0. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, after the execution of the if else block, the loop or if statement will break out if the length of `nom` is equal to the remainder of `n` divided by 10 plus 2, `nom.append(x)` is executed.**
