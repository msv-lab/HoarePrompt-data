Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1, the integer division of 1000000 by `res`, and the appended value of `res_`, `x` is 0, the length of `nom` is either 11 or n % 10 + 4. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, we break out of the loop. If the length of `nom` is equal to n % 10 + 2, the loop is exited after the execution of the if statement.***
