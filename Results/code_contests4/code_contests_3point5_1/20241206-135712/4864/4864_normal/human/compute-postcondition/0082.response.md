Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1, the loop executes with `x` as 999999. If the length of `nom` is 10, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, then the most internal loop or if statement breaks.***
