Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and a specific integer based on input `n`, `x` is `x-1`. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
