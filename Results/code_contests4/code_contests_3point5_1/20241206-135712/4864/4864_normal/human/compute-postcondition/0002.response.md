Example Answer:
`nom` is assigned a list containing the integer 1. `n` is within the specified range of 1 to 105, and `change` remains at 1000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1**
