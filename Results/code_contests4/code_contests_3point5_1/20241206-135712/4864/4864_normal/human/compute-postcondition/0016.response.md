Example Answer:
`x` is added to the list `nom` in each iteration. If the length of `nom` becomes equal to `n`, we break out of the loop or if statement. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 9, `change` remains 1000000, and `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x` added in each iteration.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 9, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x` added in each iteration**
