According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is within the range of 1000000 to 1 in descending order. For the loop to execute, `x` will start at 1000000 and decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. Since the loop starts at 1000000 - 1 and decrements by 1, it will execute `n` number of times where `n` is less than or equal to 10.
State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from 1000000 - 1 and decrementing by 1 in each iteration**
