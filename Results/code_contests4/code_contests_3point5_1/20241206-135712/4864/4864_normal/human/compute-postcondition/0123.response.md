According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x` as it iterates from 1000000 - 1 down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be 0.
State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1, the integer division of 1000000 by `res`, and the appended value of `res_`, `x` is 0, the length of `nom` is either 11 or n % 10 + 4**.
