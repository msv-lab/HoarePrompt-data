Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`, where `n` is an integer input within the specified range. The value of `n` can be between 11 and 105. Therefore, `res` will be a calculated value based on the input value of `n`. Other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, `n` is an integer where 10000 < n <= 100000. If n == 100000, the code prints '1000000 2', `res` is a calculated value based on the input value of `n`**
