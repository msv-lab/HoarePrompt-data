According to the code, the loop will execute as long as x is greater than 0. Since x starts at 1000000 - 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is within the range of 11 to 105 and is appended to `nom`, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1 and a specific integer value based on the input `n` is appended to `nom`, for the loop to execute `x` is greater than 0**
