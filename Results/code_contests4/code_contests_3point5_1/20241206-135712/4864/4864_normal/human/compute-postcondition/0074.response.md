Example Answer:
`nom` is appended with the value of `res_`, which is calculated as `change // res`. The value of `res` is calculated as `n - n % 10 - 1`. Given that `n` is within the range of 11 to 105, `res` will be a specific value. Therefore, `res_` will also be a specific value based on the calculated `res`. After appending `res_` to `nom`, the new value of `nom` will include this appended value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 and the calculated `res_` value is appended to `nom`.**
