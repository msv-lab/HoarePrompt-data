According to the code, the loop can execute again depending on the variables `n`, `nom`, and `x`. If the length of `nom` is equal to the last digit of `n` plus 2, the loop continues, otherwise, it breaks out. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is between 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains integers with updated length, and the loop variable `x` is decremented. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nom` needs to be equal to the last digit of `n` plus 3 and `x` needs to be decremented again.
State: **`n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains integers with updated length equal to the last digit of `n` plus 3, `x` is decremented by 1**
