According to the code, the loop will execute based on the range provided (from 1000000 - 1 to 0 in reverse). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains integers with updated length. Since the loop is iterating in reverse and the range starts from 1000000 - 1, for the loop to execute one more time, the range must not yet reach 1 and `n` should still be within the range of 11 to 105.
State: **`n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains integers with updated length, for the loop to execute one more time, the range should not reach 1**
