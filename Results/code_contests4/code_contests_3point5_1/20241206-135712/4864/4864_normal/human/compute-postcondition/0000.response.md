Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input from the standard input. The value of `n` is dependent on the input provided, within the constraints of 1 <= A <= 105. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 105.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 105**
