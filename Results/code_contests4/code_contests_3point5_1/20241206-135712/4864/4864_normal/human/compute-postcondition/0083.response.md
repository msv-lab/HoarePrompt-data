Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `nom`. If the length of `nom` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The conditions for breaking out of the loop are checked based on the updated length of `nom`. If the length of `nom` is 10 or `n % 10 + 2`, then the most internal loop or if statement breaks.
Output State: **`n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains integers with updated length, the loop condition is checked based on the updated length of `nom`.**
