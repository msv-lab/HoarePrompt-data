Example Answer: 
`res_` is assigned the value of the integer division of `change` by `res`. As `change` is 1000000 and `res` is a calculated value based on the input value of `n`, `res_` is calculated accordingly. If the input value of `n` is 100000, the code prints '1000000 2'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, `n` is an integer where 10000 < n <= 100000, `res_` is the result of integer division of 1000000 by `res`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, `n` is an integer where 10000 < n <= 100000, `res_` is the result of integer division of 1000000 by `res`**
