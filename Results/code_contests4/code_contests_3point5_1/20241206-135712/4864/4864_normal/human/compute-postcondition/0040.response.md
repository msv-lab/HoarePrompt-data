Example Answer:
`res_` is assigned the value of `change` divided by `res`. The value of `change` is 1000000, and `res` is calculated by subtracting the last digit of `n` and 1 from `n`, which falls within the range of 11 to 105. Therefore, after calculation, `res_` will have a specific value based on the input `n`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1, `res_` is a specific integer value based on the input `n`**
