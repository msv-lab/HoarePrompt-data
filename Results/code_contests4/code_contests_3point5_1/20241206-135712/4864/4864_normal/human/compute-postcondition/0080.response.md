Output State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is 999999, and the length of `nom` is not equal to 10. The length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
