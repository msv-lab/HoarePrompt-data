Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing the integer 1 and the integer division of 1000000 by `res`, `nom` now contains the appended value of `res_`, `x` is 0, the length of `nom` is either 11 or n % 10 + 3. If the length of `nom` is equal to n % 10 + 2, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
