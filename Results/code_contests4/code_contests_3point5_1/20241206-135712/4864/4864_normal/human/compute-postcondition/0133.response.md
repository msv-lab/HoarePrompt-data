Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers. If 10 < n <= 100, `nom` contains the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`, `x` is 0, the length of `nom` is 10 or more. If 100 < n <= 1000, `nom` contains 1 and a specific integer based on input `n`. If n < 10, `nom` has 10 elements from 1 to 10. If n >= 10, `nom` has `n % 10 + 2` elements. If 1000 < n <= 10000, `nom` has integers with a length equal to the last digit of `n` plus 2. If n is not within the ranges mentioned, `nom` contains the integer 1, the integer division of 1000000 by `res`, the appended value of `res_`, `x` is 0, the length of `nom` is either 11 or n % 10 + 4. The loop is exited when the length of `nom` is 10 or n % 10 + 2 after the if statement is executed.***
