Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1, the loop executes the first time with `x` as 999999, and the length of `nom` is not equal to 10. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
