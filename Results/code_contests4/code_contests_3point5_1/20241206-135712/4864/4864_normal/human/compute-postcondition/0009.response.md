According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, decrementing `x` starting from 1000000 - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is within the range of 1 to 10, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x` added in each iteration. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration should have `n` within the range of 1 to 9, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x - 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer input from the standard input within the range of 1 to 9, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing integers 1 and `x - 1` added in each iteration**
