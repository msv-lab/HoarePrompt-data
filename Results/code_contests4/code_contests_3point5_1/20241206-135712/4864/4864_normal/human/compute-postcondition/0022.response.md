Example Answer: 
`res_` is dependent on the tens digit of `n` minus 1. The tens digit of `n` ranges from 1 to 10, so the value of `res_` will range from 0 to 9. After appending `res_` to `nom`, the list `nom` will contain the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from 11 to 105, `change` is 1000000, `nom` contains the integer 1 followed by the values of `res_`**
