Correctness: **True**

The provided program generates a test case based on the number of ways to make change as described in the problem description. The program reads an integer input `n`, then constructs a list `nom` based on certain conditions depending on the value of `n`. The constructed list `nom` contains denominations of coins such that the number of ways to make change matches the input value `n`. The program then prints the amount of change, the number of denominations, and the denominations themselves.

The program follows the problem description as it generates a test case that produces the given number of ways to make change.
