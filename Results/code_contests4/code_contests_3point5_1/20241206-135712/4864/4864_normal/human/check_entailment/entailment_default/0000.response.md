Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints suggest that the code constructs the list `nom` based on certain conditions depending on the value of `n`. However, the code does not always correctly follow these conditions. For example, when `n` is between 11 and 100, the code is supposed to start `nom` with 1 followed by specific values, but it does not do so. Additionally, the code does not handle all the cases described in the problem description, leading to incorrect output.
