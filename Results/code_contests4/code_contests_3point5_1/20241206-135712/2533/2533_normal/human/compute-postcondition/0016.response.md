According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`. At the end of the previous iteration, all values from `line` were split and yielded one by one. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input available from `sys.stdin` and the next line should be split and yielded one by one.
