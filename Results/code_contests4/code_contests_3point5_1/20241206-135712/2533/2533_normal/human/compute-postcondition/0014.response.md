Example Answer:
The code `yield value` will yield a new value. Since the initial state mentions that the input from `sys.stdin` is available, `line` is split into values, and a new value is yielded, the output state will have the new yielded value along with the existing state.
Output State: **The input from `sys.stdin` is available, `line` is split into values, a new value is yielded**.
