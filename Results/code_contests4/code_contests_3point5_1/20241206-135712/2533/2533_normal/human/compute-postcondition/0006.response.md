Example Answer:
The code yields the value of the variable `value`, which is the third value after splitting the string `line`. The initial state specifies that `line` is a string with at least 3 values when split, so the value of `value` is determined by the splitting process. 
Output State: **The code yields the value of the third value after splitting the string `line`.**
