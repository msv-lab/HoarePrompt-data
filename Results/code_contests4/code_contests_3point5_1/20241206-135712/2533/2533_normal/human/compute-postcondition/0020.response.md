Example Answer: 
The code snippet yields the `value` from the input available from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available to be split and yielded one by one. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one.
Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one.**
