Example Answer:
`value` is yielded one by one from the input available in `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available to be split and yielded. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one.
Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one**
