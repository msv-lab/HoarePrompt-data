According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` and `line` is split into values to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, there is still input available from `sys.stdin` and `line` is split into values to iterate over. For the loop to execute one more time, there must still be input available from `sys.stdin` and `line` must still be split into values to iterate over.
State: **The loop will execute one more time as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is split into values to iterate over**
