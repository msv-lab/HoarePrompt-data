According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one. At the end of the previous iteration, the input from `sys.stdin` has been split and yielded up to a certain point.
So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next input value needs to be available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded.
State: **The next input value from `sys.stdin` is available for splitting and yielding**
