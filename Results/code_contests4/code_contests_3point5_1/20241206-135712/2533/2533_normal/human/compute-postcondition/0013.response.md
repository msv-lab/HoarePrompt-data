According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the availability of input from `sys.stdin`, the splitting of `line` into values, and whether a value has been yielded. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time the input from `sys.stdin` must still be available, `line` must be split into values, and a new value must be yielded.
State: **The input from `sys.stdin` is available, `line` is split into values, and a new value is yielded**
