Example Answer: 
The yield keyword returns a value and pauses the function, allowing it to be resumed where it was left off. In this case, the yield statement yields the value from the input. The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`. The variable `line` is split into values to iterate over. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will execute one more time as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is split into values to iterate over and a value has been yielded.
Output State: **The loop will execute one more time as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is split into values to iterate over and a value has been yielded.**
