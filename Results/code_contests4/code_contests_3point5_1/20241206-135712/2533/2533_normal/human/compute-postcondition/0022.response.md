Example Answer:
The `yield` statement produces a value to be returned from a generator function. In this case, the next input value from `sys.stdin` is yielded. There is no change in the initial state values. Therefore, the Output State is: The next input value from `sys.stdin` is available for splitting and yielding.
Output State: **The next input value from `sys.stdin` is available for splitting and yielding**
