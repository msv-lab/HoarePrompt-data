Example Answer:
The code snippet `yield value` will yield the value to the caller each time it is called. This does not directly affect the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will execute one more time as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is split into values to iterate over.
Output State: **The loop will execute one more time as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`, `line` is split into values to iterate over**
