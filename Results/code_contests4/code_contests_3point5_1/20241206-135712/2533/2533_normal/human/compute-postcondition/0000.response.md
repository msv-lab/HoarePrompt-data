According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from the standard input. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **Precondition**: 
- n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100,000.
- rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 ≤ rix, riy ≤ 100,000 and -100,000 ≤ vix, viy ≤ 100,000.
- For the loop to execute, there must be input available from the standard input.
