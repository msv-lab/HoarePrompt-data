According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `line`. If the line has at least 3 values after splitting, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a string with at least 2 values when split, `value` is the second value after splitting has been yielded. So for the loop to execute one more time, `line` must have at least 3 values after splitting, and the `value` will be the third value in the list.
State: **`line` is a string with at least 3 values when split, `value` is the third value after splitting has been yielded**
