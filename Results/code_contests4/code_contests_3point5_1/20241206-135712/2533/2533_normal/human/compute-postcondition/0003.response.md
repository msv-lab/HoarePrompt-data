According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `line` variable being a string with at least 1 value when split. If the string has more than 1 value after splitting, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `line` is a string with at least 1 value when split, `value` is the first value after splitting has been yielded. So for the loop to execute one more time, `line` should be a string with at least 2 values when split, and `value` should be the second value after splitting has been yielded.
State: **`line` is a string with at least 2 values when split, `value` is the second value after splitting has been yielded**
