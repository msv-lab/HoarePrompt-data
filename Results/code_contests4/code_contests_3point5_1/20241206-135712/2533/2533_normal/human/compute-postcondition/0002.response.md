Example Answer:
The `yield` keyword is used to produce a value to the caller without terminating the function. In this case, `value` is yielded, which is the first value after splitting the `line` string. Therefore, the output state is: `line` is a string with at least 1 value when split, `value` is the first value after splitting has been yielded.
Output State: **`line` is a string with at least 1 value when split, `value` is the first value after splitting has been yielded**
