According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed as long as there was input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be additional input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded.
State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one**.
