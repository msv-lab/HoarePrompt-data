According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `line` being a string with at least 1 value when split. So, for the loop to execute, the `line` variable needs to be adjusted to a string with at least 1 value after splitting, and the `value` variable needs to be the first value in the split line.
State: **Precondition, for the loop to execute the first time `line` is a string with at least 1 value when split, `value` is the first value after splitting**
