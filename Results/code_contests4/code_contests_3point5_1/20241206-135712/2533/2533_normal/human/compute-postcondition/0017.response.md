According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input available from `sys.stdin`. As long as there is input available, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one for the loop to execute.

State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin` to be split and yielded one by one**
