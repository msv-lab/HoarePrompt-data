Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value stored in the variable `value`. The value of `value` is the second value after splitting the string stored in the variable `line`. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` is a string with at least 2 values when split, `value` is the second value after splitting has been yielded.
Output State: **`line` is a string with at least 2 values when split, `value` is the second value after splitting has been yielded**
