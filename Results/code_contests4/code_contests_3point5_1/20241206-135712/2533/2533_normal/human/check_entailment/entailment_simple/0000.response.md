Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not actually solve the problem described. The program reads input from `sys.stdin` line by line, splitting each line into values. However, it does not perform any calculations or logic to determine the earliest time moment in which Igor is able to catch all the mice.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
