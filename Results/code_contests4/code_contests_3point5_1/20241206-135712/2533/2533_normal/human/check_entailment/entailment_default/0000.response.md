Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input correctly and processes the information about the mice and the mousetrap.
- It calculates the earliest time moment in which Igor can catch all the mice by determining the intersection points of the mice's paths with the mousetrap.
- The code handles cases where a mouse is already outside the mousetrap or has a speed of 0 correctly by outputting -1.
- It uses Fraction to accurately calculate the time moments.
- The code outputs the minimum possible non-negative number 't' such that if Igor closes the mousetrap at 't' seconds from the beginning, then all the mice are strictly inside the mousetrap.

Overall, the code seems to follow the problem description accurately and covers all potential cases as specified.
