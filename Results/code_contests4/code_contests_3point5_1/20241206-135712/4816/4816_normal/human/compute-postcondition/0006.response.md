Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `num`. Since `sum` is initially set to the first integer in the list and `num` is set to the second integer in the list, the new value of `sum` will be the sum of the first two integers in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `sum` is the sum of the first two integers in the list, num is the second integer in the list**
