According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `sum` is the sum of the first two integers in the list, num is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 integers, and `sum` should be updated to include the next integer in the list after `num`, and num should be updated to the third integer in the list.
State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `sum` is the sum of the first three integers in the list, num is the third integer in the list**
