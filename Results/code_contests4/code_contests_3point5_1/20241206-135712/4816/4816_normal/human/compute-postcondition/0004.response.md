Example Answer: 
`sum` is incremented by the value of `num`, where `num` is the first integer in the list `NUMBERS`. Since `num` is the first integer in the list, and `sum` was initially 0, the new value of `sum` is the value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `sum` is the value of the first integer in the list, num is the first integer in the list.
Output State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `sum` is the value of the first integer in the list, num is the first integer in the list**
