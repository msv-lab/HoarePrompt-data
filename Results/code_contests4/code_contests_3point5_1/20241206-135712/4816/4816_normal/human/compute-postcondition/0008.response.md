Example Answer:
`sum` is incremented by the value of `num`, where `num` is the third integer in the list `NUMBERS`. Since `sum` is the sum of the first three integers in the list, adding `num` to `sum` essentially adds the fourth integer in the list to the sum. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `sum` is the sum of the first three integers in the list, `num` is the third integer in the list.
Output State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `sum` is the sum of the first three integers in the list, `num` is the third integer in the list**
