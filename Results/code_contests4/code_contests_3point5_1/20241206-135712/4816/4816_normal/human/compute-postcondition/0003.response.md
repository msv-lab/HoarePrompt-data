According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list NUMBERS. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the sum is 0. So, for the loop to be executed, the NUMBERS list must have at least 1 integer, and the variable num is the first integer in the list.
State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `sum` is 0, num is the first integer in the list**
