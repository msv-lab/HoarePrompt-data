Example Answer:
The list `numbers` is created by converting each element of the string `NUMBERS` into an integer and splitting it by space. The length of `numbers` will be N-1. As N is assigned the value of N, the length of `numbers` will be N-1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers, n is an input integer.
Output State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers, n is an input integer**
