Example Answer:
The expression `n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum` is evaluated and then converted to an integer. The result is then written to the standard output. The variables `N`, `NUMBERS`, `sum`, and `num` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer, `NUMBERS` is a list of integers, `sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `NUMBERS`, `num` is the last integer in the list.
Output State: **`N` is an integer, `NUMBERS` is a list of integers, `sum` is the sum of all integers in the list `NUMBERS`, `num` is the last integer in the list**
