According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it depends on the variables `num` and `numbers`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `NUMBERS` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `sum` is the value of the first integer in the list, `num` is the first integer in the list. Since `num` iterates through the list `NUMBERS`, to execute the loop again, there must be at least one more integer in the list after the last iteration.
State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `sum` is the value of the first integer in the list, num is the second integer in the list**
