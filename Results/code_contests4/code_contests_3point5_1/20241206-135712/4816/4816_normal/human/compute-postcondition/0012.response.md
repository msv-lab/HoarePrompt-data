Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `N`, an integer within the range 2 to 100000, and `NUMBERS`, a list of integers where each integer falls between 1 and N, with the length of `NUMBERS` being N-1. The function calculates the sum of integers in the `NUMBERS` list, subtracts it from the sum of integers from 1 to N, and outputs the result.**
