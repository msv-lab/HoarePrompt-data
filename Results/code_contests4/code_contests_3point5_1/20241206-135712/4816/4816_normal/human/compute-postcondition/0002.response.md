Example Answer:
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers, n is an input integer, `sum` is 0.
Output State: **N is an integer, NUMBERS is a list of integers, n is an input integer, `sum` is 0**
