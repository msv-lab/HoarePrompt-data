Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input N (number of episodes) and a list of episodes watched by Polycarpus. It then calculates the sum of the episodes watched and subtracts it from the sum of all episodes in the season to find the episode that Polycarpus hasn't watched. This matches the problem description as it correctly identifies the missing episode based on the input provided. The program always outputs the correct missing episode number.
