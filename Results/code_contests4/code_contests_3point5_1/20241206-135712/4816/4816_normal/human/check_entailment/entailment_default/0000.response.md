Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided reads the input, calculates the sum of watched episodes, computes the sum of all episodes using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, subtracts the sum of watched episodes from the total sum, and outputs the missing episode number. The code is correctly following the problem description for every potential case. It handles the input within the specified ranges and provides the correct output based on the given scenario. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code is not handling. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that it performs the required calculations accurately.
