Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input for the number of episodes and the episodes Polycarpus has watched. It then calculates the sum of all the episodes watched and subtracts it from the sum of all episodes to find the episode Polycarpus hasn't watched. The logic seems correct and the program should work as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
