Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly identify the episode that Polycarpus has not watched. The program calculates the sum of all the episodes that Polycarpus has watched and then subtracts it from the sum of all episodes from 1 to n. However, this logic is incorrect as the episode numbers are not guaranteed to be in sequential order.

For example, if the input is:
```
5
2 3 5 1
```
The program will output `4` as the missing episode, but the correct answer should be `4`.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
