The function calculates the absolute value of an input `n`, then performs a series of mathematical operations to determine the result based on the value of `n`. The function prints a value based on the result of the mathematical operations involving `n` and some predefined matrices. The overall result is the sum of a specific element from one of the matrices and `d`, where `d` is derived from `n`. The function does not return any value but prints the final result, which is the sum of a matrix element and `d`.
