Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The formula used to calculate the number of jumps is incorrect and does not match the logic described in the problem. The program uses a complex formula involving ceiling, square root, and modular arithmetic which does not correspond to the simple logic described in the problem.

Additionally, the print statement is using a list of lists to determine the number of jumps, which is not related to the problem description at all.

Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x as described in the problem.
