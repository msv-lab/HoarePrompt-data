Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x by following the steps outlined in the problem description. It calculates the absolute value of the input, then uses mathematical operations to determine the result based on the value of the input. The final result printed by the program is the minimal number of jumps required to reach x, which aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
