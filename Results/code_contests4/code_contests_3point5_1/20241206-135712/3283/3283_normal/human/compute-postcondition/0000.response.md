Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the absolute value of the input, so if the input is negative, it will be converted to a positive integer. The value of `x` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is the absolute value of the input.
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is the absolute value of the input**
