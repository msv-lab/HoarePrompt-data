Example Answer:
The value of `n` is the absolute value of the input, and it is used in the calculation to assign a value to `d` using the formula provided. The `sqrt` function calculates the square root, and the `ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer. Since the value of `n` can vary, the value of `d` will also vary accordingly. 
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is the absolute value of the input, `d` is an integer calculated using the formula**
