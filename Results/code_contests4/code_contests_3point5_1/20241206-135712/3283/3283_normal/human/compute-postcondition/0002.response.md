Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated using the formula provided. The value of `n` is the absolute value of the input. The code prints the value at the specified indices of the 2D list and adds `d` to it. The final result is the sum of the value retrieved from the list and `d`. 
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is the absolute value of the input, `d` is an integer calculated using the formula, the final result after calculation is displayed.**
