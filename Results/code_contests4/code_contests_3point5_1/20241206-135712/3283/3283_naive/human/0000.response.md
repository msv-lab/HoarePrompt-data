Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x by using a mathematical formula. The program calculates the absolute value of the input, then calculates the number of jumps required using the formula ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2). Finally, it prints the result based on the values in the list [[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]] depending on the parity of n and d. 
For all the given potential cases (2, 6, 0), the program gives the correct output as per the problem description.
