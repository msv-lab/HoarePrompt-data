Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x. It seems to be using a hardcoded lookup table instead of calculating the result based on the given problem description. Additionally, the math logic used in the program does not align with the problem requirements. 

For example, if we input x = 2, the output should be 3 according to the problem description. However, the program outputs 1, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
