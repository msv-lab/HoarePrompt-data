def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the user's input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a range specified by user input, takes an integer input `n`, and a string input `s`, then prints every other character of the string `s`. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input string separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 reads input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts the substrings into integers, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is obtained by adding the integer value of each element in the input separated by spaces to the value of variable 'o'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `o` and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the list is obtained by adding the integer value of each element in the input (separated by spaces) to the value of variable `o`. The function reads input from the user during execution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is a binary string of length 2n - 1.**
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of length n, where each element in the list is the result of calling func_2(). The value of n is an integer between 1 and 50, and the value of m is a binary string of length 2n - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts two parameters, an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and a binary string m of length 2n - 1. It returns a list of length n where each element is the result of calling func_2().

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **n is a positive integer, and s is a binary string of length 2n-1 consisting of characters 0 or 1.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns the result of calling function func_5 with arguments f, *dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty. Otherwise, it returns the result of calling function f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `f` and returns the result of calling function `func_5` with arguments `f`, *dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty. Otherwise, it returns the result of calling function `f()`. The provided annotations mention `n` as a positive integer and `s` as a binary string of length 2n-1 consisting of characters 0 or 1, but these variables are not utilized in the code. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is solely based on the logic in the code, which involves recursive function calls and handling an empty `dim` list.
