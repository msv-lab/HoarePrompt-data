Based on the provided problem description and the code, the initial assessment is as follows:

The code seems to correctly handle the input of the number of test cases, the length of the binary string, and the binary string itself. It then constructs a binary string 'w' of length n that is similar to all the specified substrings of the input string 's'.

Now, let's analyze if the output hints agree with the code:
- The output hints describe the input format and the expected output format, but they do not provide specific edge cases or scenarios that the code might not handle correctly.
- The hints do not provide any additional information that contradicts the code logic or indicates any potential issues.

Therefore, after considering both the code and the output hints, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct as it aligns with the problem description and there are no apparent cases where the code does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
