According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input `n`. If the input `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still greater than 0. Since `n` is not modified within the loop, it remains the same for the next iteration. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to remain greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the user's input, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must remain greater than 0**
