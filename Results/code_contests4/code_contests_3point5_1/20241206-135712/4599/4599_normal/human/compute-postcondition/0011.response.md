Example Answer:
The code prints every second character of the string `s`, starting from the first character. Since we are only printing and not modifying any variables, the states of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the user's input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the user's input**
