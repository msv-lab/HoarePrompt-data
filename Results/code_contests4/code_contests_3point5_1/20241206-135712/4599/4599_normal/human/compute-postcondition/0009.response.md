Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is an input integer greater than 0. The variable `s` is not affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the user's input**
