Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer n and the binary string s. It then prints a binary string w of length n by taking every second character from the input string s. This logic satisfies the problem description as it constructs a binary string w that is similar to all the required substrings. The program seems to be correctly implemented for all potential cases based on the problem description provided.
