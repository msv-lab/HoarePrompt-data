The function func_1 accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns the result. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum before returning. However, the annotation mentions a variable `mod` without defining it, so the functionality may not cover all potential cases, specifically when `mod` is not provided.
