Example Answer:
`cnt[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is 2. Since `cnt` is initially an empty dictionary and the key `2` does not exist, the value is set to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and value 1, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and value 1, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4**
