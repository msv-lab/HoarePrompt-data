Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, which is 5. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop will execute again. The keys `2` and `3` in the dictionary `cnt` will have their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`**
