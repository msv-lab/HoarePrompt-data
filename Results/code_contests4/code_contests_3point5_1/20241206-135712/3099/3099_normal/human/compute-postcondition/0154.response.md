Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the `answer` dictionary with the maximum value between the current value of `answer` for a specific key and the value of that key in the `cnt` dictionary. If the key does not exist in `answer`, it initializes it with the value from `cnt`. The loop will continue for the next key in `cnt`. 
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys representing the prime factors of the original value of `x` and values indicating the number of times each prime factor divides `x`, `answer` is updated with the maximum value for each key from `cnt`, the loop will execute for the next key in `cnt`**
