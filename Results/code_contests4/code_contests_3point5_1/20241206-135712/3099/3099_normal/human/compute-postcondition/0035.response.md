According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next value that satisfies `i * i > x`, which means `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value that satisfies `i * i > x`. Additionally, `x` is divided by `i`, so `x` needs to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the next value that satisfies `i * i > x`, `cnt` is a dictionary with key 2 representing the number of times `x` at index 2 in `arr` can be divided by 2, `x` is divided by `i`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`.**
