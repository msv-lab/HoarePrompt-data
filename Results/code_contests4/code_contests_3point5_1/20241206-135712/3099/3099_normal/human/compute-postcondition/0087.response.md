Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, and for the loop to execute again, `i * i` should be less than or equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` have been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`.
