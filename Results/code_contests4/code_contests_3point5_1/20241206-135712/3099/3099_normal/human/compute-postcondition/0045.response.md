Example Answer:
The code increments the count of the prime factor `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. If `x` was not already a key in `cnt`, it is added with a value of 1. Therefore, after execution, the count of `x` in `cnt` is increased by 1.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, answer is an empty dictionary, arr is a list of integers, i is the smallest prime factor of x, cnt is a dictionary containing the count of how many times each prime factor divides x, x is the value of the element at index 2 in the list arr divided by the product of all prime factors of x, the count of x in cnt is incremented by 1**
