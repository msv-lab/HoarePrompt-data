Example Answer: 
`cnt[i]` is updated by incrementing the current value of `cnt[i]` by 1 or setting it to 1 if `i` is not already in the dictionary. The variables `n`, `answer`, `arr`, `x`, `i` are not affected by this operation. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` has been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` has been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
