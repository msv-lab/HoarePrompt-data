According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `cnt` and the number of keys it contains. If `cnt` has at least 3 keys, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `answer[key]` has been updated, `arr` remains unchanged, `x` has been fully divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is one greater than the square root of the original `x`, and if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` has been updated. So for the loop to execute a second time, `cnt` must have at least 3 keys.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]`, `arr` remains unchanged, `x` has been fully divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is one greater than the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `cnt` has at least 3 keys**.
