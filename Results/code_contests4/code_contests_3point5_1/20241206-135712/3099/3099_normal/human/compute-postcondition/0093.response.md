Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is known to be greater than the square root of the original `x`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `i` will be one greater than the previous value. Other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` have been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x` until `x % i != 0`, `i` is one greater than the previous value**
