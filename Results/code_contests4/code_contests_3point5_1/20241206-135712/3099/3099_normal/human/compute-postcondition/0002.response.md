Example Answer:
A dictionary named `answer` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store key-value pairs. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created by converting the input using `int(x) for x in raw_input().split()`, `answer` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created by converting the input using `int(x) for x in raw_input().split()`, `answer` is an empty dictionary**
