According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x % i == 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be divisible by `i`. Right before the loop, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, so `x` needs to be adjusted to be divisible by `i` for the loop to execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 5, `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
