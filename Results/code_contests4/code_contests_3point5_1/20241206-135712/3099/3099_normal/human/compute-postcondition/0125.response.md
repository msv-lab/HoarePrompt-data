According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x % i == 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `x % i == 0` and possibly increment or update the value of `i` to continue the loop.
State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values, for the loop to execute again, `x % i == 0` and `i` should be updated or incremented**
