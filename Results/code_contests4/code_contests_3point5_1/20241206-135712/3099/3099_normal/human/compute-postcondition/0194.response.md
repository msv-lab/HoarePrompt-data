Functionality: **The function `func_6` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It then calculates the prime factors of each element in `arr`, determines the maximum count of each prime factor, calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of these prime factors, and finally computes a result based on multiple function calls. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the final result after processing the input.**
