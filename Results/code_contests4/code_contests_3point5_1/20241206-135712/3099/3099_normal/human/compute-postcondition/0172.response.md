Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` has more keys to iterate over, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `x`, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of how many times each prime factor divides `x`, `x` is fully divided by all prime factors, if `x` is not equal to 1, `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, `cnt` has at least 1 key, `lcm` is the result of `func_2` applied to the previous value of `lcm` and `prime`, `prime` is a key in the `answer` dictionary, `_` is equal to `answer[prime]`, `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_2`, `answer` has a key named `prime`, and `_` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `answer[prime]` must be greater than 1**
