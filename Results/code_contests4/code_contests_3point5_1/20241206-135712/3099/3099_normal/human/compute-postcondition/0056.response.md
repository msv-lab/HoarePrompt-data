Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `i` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is still an empty dictionary. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x`, `i` are unchanged, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x`, `i` are unchanged, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
