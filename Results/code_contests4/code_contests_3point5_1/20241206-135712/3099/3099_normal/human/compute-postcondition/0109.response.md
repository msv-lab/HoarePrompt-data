According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `x` is greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is greater than or equal to 4**
