Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the value of `i`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The count of the prime factor `i` in the factorization of `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`**
