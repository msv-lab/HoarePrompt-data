According to the code, the loop will execute if the condition `x % i == 0` is satisfied. Right before the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `i`, `x`, `cnt` remain unchanged. `x` has been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, and `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted such that `i * i` is still less than or equal to `x`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` has been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
