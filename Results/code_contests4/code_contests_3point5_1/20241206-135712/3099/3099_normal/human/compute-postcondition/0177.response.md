According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `answer` and `prime`. If the value of `answer[prime]` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `answer` has one more key to iterate over with the key `prime`, `answer` has a key named `prime` with a value of at least 1, `_` is equal to 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should be less than the value of `answer[prime]`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` has one more key to iterate over with the key `prime`, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `x`, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of how many times each prime factor divides `x`, `x` is fully divided by all prime factors, if `x` is not equal to 1, `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, `cnt` has at least 1 key, `lcm` is the result of `func_2` applied to the previous value of `lcm` and `prime`, `prime` is a key in the `answer` dictionary, `_` is equal to 1, `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_2`, and `answer` has a key named `prime` with a value of at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time**.
