According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective updated values. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` needs to be divisible by `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective updated values, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i + 1`**
