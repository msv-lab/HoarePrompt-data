Example Answer: 
`x` is divided by `i`, and the value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `x` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
