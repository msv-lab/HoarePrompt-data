According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `x` is divided by all prime factors.  for the loop to execute again `i * i` needs to be less than or equal to `x`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
