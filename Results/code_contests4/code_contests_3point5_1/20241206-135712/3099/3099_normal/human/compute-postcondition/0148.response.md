Postcondition: ***Output State: `cnt` is a dictionary with keys representing the prime factors of the original value of `x` and values indicating the number of times each prime factor divides `x`. `i` is such that `i * i` is greater than `x` and `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore. If `x` is not equal to 1, then the count associated with the key `x` in `cnt` has been incremented by 1.***
