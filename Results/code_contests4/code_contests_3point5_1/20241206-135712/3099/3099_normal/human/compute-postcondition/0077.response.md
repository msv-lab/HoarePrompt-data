According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`, and `cnt[i]` must be assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`**
