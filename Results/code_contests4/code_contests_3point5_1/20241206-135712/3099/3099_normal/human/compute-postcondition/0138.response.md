Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the value of `i`, which is 5. Since `x` is divisible by `i`, the division will occur and update the value of `x`. The loop will execute again as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. The dictionary `cnt` is updated with keys `2` and `3` incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`. 
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 5, `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x` for the loop to execute again**
