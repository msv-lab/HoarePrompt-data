According to the code, the loop can execute again if `x` is divisible by `i`, where `i` has to be incremented by 1 and `i * i` should be less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`**
