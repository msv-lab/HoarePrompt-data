According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x`, `i`, and the condition `x % i == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be divisible by `i+1`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the count of key `i` in the dictionary `cnt` needs to be updated by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `answer`
- `arr`
- `x` is divided by `i`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered

To adjust the states for the loop to execute again:
- `x` should be divisible by `i+1`
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- The count of key `i` in the dictionary `cnt` should be updated by 1

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i+2`, `i` is incremented by 1, the count of key `i+1` in the dictionary `cnt` is updated by 1**
