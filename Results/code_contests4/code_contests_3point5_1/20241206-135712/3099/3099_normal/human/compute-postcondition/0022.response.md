Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented to the next value that satisfies `i * i <= x`, `cnt` is a dictionary with key 2 and a value representing the number of times `x` at index 2 in `arr` can be divided by 2, `x` is the value of the element at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by 2 for the loop to execute the first time `x % i == 0`, `x` is updated by dividing it by `i`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`.**
