Example Answer:
`cnt` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
