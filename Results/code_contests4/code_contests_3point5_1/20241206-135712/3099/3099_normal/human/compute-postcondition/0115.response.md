Example Answer:
The value of `i` is 2, and `cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and value 1. After the execution of the code, `cnt[2]` is updated to 2 (previous value + 1) using the `get` method. The value of `x` is not affected as it was not mentioned in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and value 2, `i` is 2, `x` is now updated after dividing by `i`.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and value 2, `i` is 2, `x` is now updated after dividing by `i`**
