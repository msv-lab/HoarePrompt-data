According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `x % i == 0` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` have been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, and `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * i` must be less than or equal to `x`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` have been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
