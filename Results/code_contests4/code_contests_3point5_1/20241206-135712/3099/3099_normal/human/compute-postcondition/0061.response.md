Example Answer:
The code `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` increases the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. If the key `i` does not exist in the dictionary `cnt`, it will be created with a value of 1. Since the initial state does not provide any specific value for `i`, the output state will be: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered**
