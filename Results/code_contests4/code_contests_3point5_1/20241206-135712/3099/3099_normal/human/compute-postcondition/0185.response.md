Example Answer:
`func_4(x)` is called and returns a value, which is then used as an argument in `func_2(lcm, returned_value)`. The result of this function call is then used as an argument in `func_1(ans, returned_value)`. The output state depends on the specific values returned by each function, as well as the initial value of `ans`.
Output State: **output state**
