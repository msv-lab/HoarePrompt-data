Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`. Since we know `x` is divided by `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `x` is `x/i` where `i` is the incremented value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i+1` and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i+1` and `i` is incremented by 1**
