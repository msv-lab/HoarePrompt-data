According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be adjusted so that `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` has been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**.
