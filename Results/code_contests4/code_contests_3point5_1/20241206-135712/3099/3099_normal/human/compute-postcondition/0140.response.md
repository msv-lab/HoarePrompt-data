According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x % i == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be divisible by `i` again, so the values in the dictionary `cnt` for keys `2` and `3` need to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i` where `i` is 5, `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x` for the loop to execute again**
