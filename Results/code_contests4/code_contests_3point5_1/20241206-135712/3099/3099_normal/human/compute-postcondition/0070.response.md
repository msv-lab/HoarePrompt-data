According to the loop condition, the loop can execute again if `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted so that `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
