Example Answer:
`lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(lcm, prime)`. The previous value of `lcm` is unknown, but `prime` has a value greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer` has one more key named `prime` with a value greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `lcm` is updated based on the return value of `func_2`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` has one more key named `prime` with a value greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `lcm` is updated based on the return value of `func_2`**
