Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by all prime factors, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`**
