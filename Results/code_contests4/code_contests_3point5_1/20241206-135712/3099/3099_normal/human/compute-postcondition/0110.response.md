According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x % i == 0`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is not defined and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` needs to be greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is greater than or equal to 4**
