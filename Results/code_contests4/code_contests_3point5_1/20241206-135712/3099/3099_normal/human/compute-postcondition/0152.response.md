Example Answer:
The `answer` dictionary is updated by taking the maximum value between the current value of `answer` at key `key` and the value of `cnt` at key `key`. If `key` is not present in `answer`, the default value is set to 0. The loop will consider the next key in `cnt` for the next iteration. The initial state of `cnt` and `answer` are unchanged. 
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys representing the prime factors of the original value of `x` and values indicating the number of times each prime factor divides `x`, `answer` is updated with the maximum value for each key from `cnt`, for the loop to execute one more time the next key in `cnt` should be considered**
