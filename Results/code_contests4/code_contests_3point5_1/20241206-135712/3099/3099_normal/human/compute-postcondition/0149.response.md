According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys present in the dictionary `cnt`. If the dictionary has at least one key, the loop will execute. At the start, `x` is the original value and `cnt` is a dictionary with prime factors of `x`. To ensure the loop executes, the dictionary `cnt` must have at least one key representing a prime factor of `x`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `cnt` has at least one key.

State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys representing the prime factors of the original value of `x` and values indicating the number of times each prime factor divides `x`, for the loop to execute the first time the dictionary `cnt` has at least one key**
