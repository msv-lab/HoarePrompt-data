Example Answer:
`cnt[i]` is updated by incrementing the count of the prime factor `i` encountered in the factorization of `x`. If `i` was not encountered before, its count is initialized to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is updated.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr` remain unchanged, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is updated**
