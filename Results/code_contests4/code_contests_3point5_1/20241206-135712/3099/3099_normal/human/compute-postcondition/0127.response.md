Example Answer:
The value of `cnt[i]` is updated by incrementing the current value of `i` by 1 or initializing it to 1 if the key `i` does not exist in the dictionary. Since `i` is a key in the dictionary `cnt`, the value of `cnt[i]` will be incremented by 1. The keys in the dictionary are still `2` and `3`, but their values have been updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective updated values.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective updated values**
