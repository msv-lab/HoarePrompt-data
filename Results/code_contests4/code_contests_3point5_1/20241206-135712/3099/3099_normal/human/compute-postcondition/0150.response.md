Example Answer:
Initially, `cnt` is a dictionary with keys representing the prime factors of the original value of `x` and values indicating the number of times each prime factor divides `x`. The code snippet `answer[key] = max(answer.get(key, 0), cnt[key])` assigns the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]` to `answer[key]` for all keys in `cnt`. If `answer` does not have the key, it assigns the value of `cnt[key]` to `answer[key]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys representing the prime factors of the original value of `x` and values indicating the number of times each prime factor divides `x`. `answer` is updated with the maximum value for each key from `cnt`.**
