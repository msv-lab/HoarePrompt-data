According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is divisible by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, you need to adjust the state so that `x` remains divisible by `i` and `i * i` is still less than or equal to `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 5, `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x` for the loop to execute again**
