Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, which can either be 2 or 3. The value of `i` is unknown in the initial state. To execute the loop again, `x` must be divisible by `i + 1`, which can happen if `x` is a multiple of 3 after division by 2 or a multiple of 4 after division by 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective updated values, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i + 1` where `x` is a multiple of 3 or 4.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective updated values, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i + 1` where `x` is a multiple of 3 or 4**
