Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the next value that satisfies `i * i > x`, `cnt` is a dictionary with key 2 representing the number of times `x` at index 2 in `arr` can be divided by 2, `x` is divided by `i`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1 for the loop to execute again `x` should be divisible by `i`**
