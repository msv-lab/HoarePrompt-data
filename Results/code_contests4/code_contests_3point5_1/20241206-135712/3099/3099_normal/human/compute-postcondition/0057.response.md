Example Answer:
The value of `i` is assigned 2. Since the previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x`, `i` are unchanged, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x`, `i` are unchanged, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2**
