Example Answer:
The code snippet `cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1` updates the count of key `i` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. If `i` is not already a key in `cnt`, it initializes the count to 0 and then adds 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i+1` and `i` is incremented by 1, the count of key `i` in the dictionary `cnt` is updated by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i+1` and `i` is incremented by 1, the count of key `i` in the dictionary `cnt` is updated by 1**
