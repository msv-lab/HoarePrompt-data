According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x`, `i`, and the result of `x % i`. If `x % i` equals 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is divided by `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. So to ensure the loop executes one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `x` must be divisible by `i+1` (since `i` is incremented by 1)
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- The count in `cnt` for the key corresponding to `i` should be updated

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` is divided by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` contains the count of each key that has been encountered, for the loop to execute again `x` is divisible by `i+1` and `i` is incremented by 1**
