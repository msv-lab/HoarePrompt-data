Example Answer:
The value of `cnt[i]` is updated by incrementing the existing value by 1 or setting it to 1 if it doesn't exist. Initially, `cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and a value equal to the number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, which is not given. After the code execution, `cnt` will have key `3` with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values**
