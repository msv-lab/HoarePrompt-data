According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array `arr`. If `arr` has more elements, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of calling `func_2` with parameters `lcm` and the result of calling `func_4` with parameter `x`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of calling `func_2` with parameters `lcm` and the result of calling `func_4` with parameter `x`, the array `arr` must have more elements for the loop to execute another time**
