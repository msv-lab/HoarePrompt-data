According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `i`, and the condition `x % i == 0`. If `x % i == 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` have been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `x % i == 0` needs to be true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x` have been divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1 and `x % i == 0`**
