According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 2 and `x` is unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time, `i * i` needs to be less than or equal to `x`. In this case, `2 * 2` is 4 which is less than or equal to `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer`, `arr`, `x`, `i` are unchanged, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the first time `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
