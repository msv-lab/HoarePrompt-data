Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `answer[key]` to the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]`. The initial state mentions that `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]`, `arr` remains unchanged, `x` has been fully divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is one greater than the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `cnt` has at least 3 keys.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]`, `arr` remains unchanged, `x` has been fully divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is one greater than the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `cnt` has at least 3 keys**
