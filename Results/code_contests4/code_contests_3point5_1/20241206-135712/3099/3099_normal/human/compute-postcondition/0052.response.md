Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` is a dictionary containing the maximum value between the current value of the key and the count of the key in `cnt`, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the smallest prime factor of `x`, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of how many times each prime factor divides `x`, `x` is the value of the element at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by the product of all prime factors of `x`, the count of `x` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `x` is not equal to 1, for the loop to execute the third time the key is the next key in `cnt` dictionary**
