Example Answer:
The value of `cnt[i]` is updated by incrementing the current value of `cnt[i]` by 1 or setting it to 1 if it doesn't exist. The keys `2` and `3` in the dictionary `cnt` are affected by this operation. If `i` is 2, then the value of `cnt[2]` will be incremented by 1. If `i` is 3, then the value of `cnt[3]` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`**
