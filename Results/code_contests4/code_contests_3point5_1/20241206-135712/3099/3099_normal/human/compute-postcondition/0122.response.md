According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 3, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore. For the loop to execute again, `i * i` needs to be less than or equal to `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and a value equal to the number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 3, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
