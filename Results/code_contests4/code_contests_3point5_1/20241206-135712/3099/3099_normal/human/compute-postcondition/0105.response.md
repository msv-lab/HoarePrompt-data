According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `cnt`. If `i` is less than `n` and `cnt` has at least 1 key, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]`, `arr` remains unchanged, `x` has been fully divided by all prime factors, `i` is greater than the square root of the original `x`, `cnt` contains the count of each prime factor encountered in the factorization of `x`, `i` is one greater than the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute, `cnt` must still have at least 1 key.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `answer[key]` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `answer[key]` and `cnt[key]`, `arr` remains unchanged, `x` has been fully divided by all prime factors, `i` is one greater than the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` still has at least 1 key**
