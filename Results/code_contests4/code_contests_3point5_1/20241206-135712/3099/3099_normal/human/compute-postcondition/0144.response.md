Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 5, so after execution, `i` becomes 6. Since `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore and `i * i` is greater than `x`, no changes occur to the dictionary `cnt`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 6, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, and `i * i` is greater than `x`.
Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 6, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, and `i * i` is greater than `x`**
