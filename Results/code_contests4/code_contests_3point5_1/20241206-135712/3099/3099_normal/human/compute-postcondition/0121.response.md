According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i * i` needs to be less than or equal to `x` after the adjustment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `cnt` is a dictionary with key `2` and a value equal to the number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 3, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, for the loop to execute again `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
