Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the smallest prime factor of `x`, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of how many times each prime factor divides `x`, `x` is the value of the element at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by the product of all prime factors of `x`. The outer loop stops when `i * i` is greater than `x`**
