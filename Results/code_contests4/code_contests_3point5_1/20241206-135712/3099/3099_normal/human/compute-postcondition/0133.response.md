According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `x`, and the condition `i * i <= x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` is 5.
State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with keys `2` and `3` and their respective values incremented by the total number of times `x` can be divided by `i`, `i` is 5, `x` is not divisible by `i` anymore, and `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`**
