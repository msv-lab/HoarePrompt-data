Output State: `n` is greater than 0, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the next value that satisfies `i * i > x`, `cnt` is a dictionary with key 2 representing the number of times `x` at index 2 in `arr` can be divided by 2, `x` is the value of the element at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by the product of all prime factors of `x`, `cnt[i]` is the count of how many times `x` can be divided by `i` for all prime factors of `x`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is divided by `i`, `cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`.
