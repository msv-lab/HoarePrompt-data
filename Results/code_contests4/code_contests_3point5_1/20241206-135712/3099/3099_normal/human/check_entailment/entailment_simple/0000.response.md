Correctness: **True**

The annotated program follows the problem description accurately. It calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given positive integers A_1,...,A_N that satisfy the condition specified in the problem. The program correctly calculates the prime factorization of each A_i, finds the least common multiple (LCM) of all the prime factors, and then computes the sum modulo (10^9 + 7) as required by the problem description.

The functions defined in the program correctly implement the necessary calculations and logic to solve the problem statement. The program ensures that the condition A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds for all i, j such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N, thereby finding the minimum possible value of the sum B_1 + ... + B_N.
