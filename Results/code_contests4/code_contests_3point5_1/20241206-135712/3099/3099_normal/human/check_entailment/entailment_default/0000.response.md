Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines several functions to calculate the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for given positive integers A_1,...,A_N.
- The functions follow the problem description accurately by performing calculations based on the conditions provided.
- The code takes into account the modulo operation to handle large values and provides the result accordingly.
- The code processes the input correctly, calculates the prime factors and LCM of the elements in the list, and computes the final result as required.
- There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the given problem description and examples.
