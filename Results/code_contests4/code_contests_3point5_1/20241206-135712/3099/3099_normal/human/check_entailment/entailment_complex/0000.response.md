Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code and the problem description, it is evident that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The functions defined in the code handle the calculation of the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given positive integers A_1, ..., A_N as described in the problem statement. The code uses mathematical operations and recursive functions to calculate the required values and outputs the result modulo (10^9 + 7) as instructed. Additionally, the annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function and how they contribute to solving the problem accurately. Therefore, based on the code structure, annotations, and adherence to the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
