You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are N positive integers A_1,...,A_N.

Consider positive integers B_1, ..., B_N that satisfy the following condition.

Condition: For any i, j such that 1 \leq i < j \leq N, A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds.

Find the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for such B_1,...,B_N.

Since the answer can be enormous, print the sum modulo (10^9 +7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^4
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for B_1,...,B_N that satisfy the condition, modulo (10^9 +7).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`c` is the sum of `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, there is no else part.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of variables `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns the result. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum before returning. However, the annotation mentions a variable `mod` without defining it, so the functionality may not cover all potential cases, specifically when `mod` is not provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of multiplying variables 'a' and 'b' and then taking the modulo 'mod' of the product.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two variables `a` and `b`, multiplies them, and returns the result after taking the modulo of the product.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, A_1, ..., A_N are positive integers.
def func_3(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    else :
        if (b % 2 == 1) :
            return func_2(a, func_3(a, b - 1))
            #The program returns the result of calling function func_2 with arguments a and the result of calling function func_3 with arguments a and b-1
        else :
            temp = func_3(a, b / 2)
            return func_2(temp, temp)
            #The program returns the value obtained by calling func_2(temp, temp), where temp is assigned the value returned by func_3(a, b / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It recursively calculates a value based on the conditions provided. 

Case 1: If `b` is 0, the function returns 1.

Case 2: If `b` is odd, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `a` and the result of calling `func_3` with arguments `a` and `b-1`.

Case 3: If `b` is even, the function returns the value obtained by calling `func_2(temp, temp)`, where `temp` is assigned the value returned by `func_3(a, b / 2)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to perform recursive calculations based on the conditions provided and return specific values accordingly.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4(a):
    return func_3(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of calling function 'func_3' with parameters 'a' and 'mod - 2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a parameter `a` and calls another function `func_3` with `a` and the value `mod - 2`. The return value of `func_4` is the result from `func_3` with these parameters.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of N positive integers and m is a positive integer.
def func_5(a, m):
    m0 = m
    y = 0
    x = 1
    if (m == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a is a list of N positive integers, m is a positive integer, y is 0, x is 1 and m is not equal to 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        
        t = m
        
        m = a % m
        
        a = t
        
        t = y
        
        y = x - q * y
        
        x = t
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is a list of N positive integers, `m` is 1, `y` is some value, `x` is some value
    if (x < 0) :
        x = x + m0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of N positive integers, `m` is 1, `y` is some value, `x` is some value. If x < 0, no changes occur to the variables `a`, `m`, and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `a` of N positive integers and a positive integer `m`. It performs a series of calculations on the elements of `a` and `m`, then returns the final value of variable `x`. If a specific condition is met, the function returns 0. Additionally, if `x` becomes negative during the calculations, it is adjusted by adding the initial value of `m`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    answer = {}
    for i in range(n):
        cnt = {}
        
        x = arr[i]
        
        i = 2
        
        while i * i <= x:
            while x % i == 0:
                x /= i
                cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1
            i += 1
        
        if x != 1:
            cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        for key in cnt:
            answer[key] = max(answer.get(key, 0), cnt[key])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `answer` is a dictionary containing the maximum count of each prime factor in `cnt`, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `x`, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of how many times each prime factor divides `x`, `x` is fully divided by all prime factors, if `x` is not equal to 1, `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute, `cnt` has at least 1 key
    lcm = 1
    for prime in answer:
        for _ in range(answer[prime]):
            lcm = func_2(lcm, prime)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `answer` has iterated over all keys in the dictionary, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than the square root of the original value of `x`, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of how many times each prime factor divides `x`, `x` is fully divided by all prime factors, if `x` is not equal to 1, `cnt[x]` is updated to its previous value incremented by 1, `cnt` has at least 1 key, `lcm` is the result of `func_2` applied to the previous value of `lcm` and each `prime`, `prime` is a key in the `answer` dictionary, `_` is equal to the total number of times the loop has executed, `lcm` is updated based on the result of `func_2`, and all keys in `answer` have been processed.
    ans = 0
    for x in arr:
        ans = func_1(ans, func_2(lcm, func_4(x)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `ans` is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of calling `func_2` with parameters `lcm` and the result of calling `func_4` with each element in `arr`. The loop will execute for each element in `arr` until all elements have been processed.
    ans = int(ans)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It then calculates the prime factors of each element in `arr`, determines the maximum count of each prime factor, calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of these prime factors, and finally computes a result based on multiple function calls. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the final result after processing the input.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
