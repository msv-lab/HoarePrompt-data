Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N satisfying the condition, and prints the result modulo (10^9 + 7).
- The program uses a combination of functions to calculate the required values and follows the logic described in the problem statement.
- The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description.
- The provided code in both Python and C++ versions seems to be correct and implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.
