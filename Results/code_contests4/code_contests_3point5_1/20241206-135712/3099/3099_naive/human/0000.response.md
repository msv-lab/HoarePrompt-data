Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given input of N positive integers A_1,...,A_N. The program follows the condition that for any i, j such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N, A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the prime factors of the input integers and then computes the sum modulo (10^9 + 7) as required. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
