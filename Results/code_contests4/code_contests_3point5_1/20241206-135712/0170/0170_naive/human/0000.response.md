Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly reads the input and implements the logic to find a sequence that satisfies the given conditions. It iterates through the elements of the sequences a, b, and c, ensuring that the current element is different from the previous element and choosing the appropriate value from the three sequences. The program then prints the sequence p which meets all the conditions specified in the problem description. The logic is implemented correctly and the program outputs the correct sequence for all the given test cases.
