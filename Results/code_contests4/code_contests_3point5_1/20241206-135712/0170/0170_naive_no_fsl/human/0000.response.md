Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the `func_19()` function, where the logic to determine the sequence `p` is incorrect. The current implementation does not guarantee that adjacent elements in the sequence will be different.

To provide a correct solution, the logic to generate the sequence `p` needs to be updated to ensure that no two adjacent elements are equal.
