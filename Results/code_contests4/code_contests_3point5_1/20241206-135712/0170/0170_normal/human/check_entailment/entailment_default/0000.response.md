Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

Upon reviewing the provided code and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly handles the given problem. The code reads the input for each test case, ensuring that the sequences a, b, and c are distinct for each position i. It then constructs a sequence p such that each element p_i belongs to {a_i, b_i, c_i} and p_i is not equal to p_{(i mod n) + 1}. This condition is satisfied by checking the previous element and assigning the current element based on the available choices.

Additionally, the code iterates over the test cases and generates the correct output sequence p for each case. The solution seems to cover all potential cases and adheres to the problem description. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the problem requirements, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
