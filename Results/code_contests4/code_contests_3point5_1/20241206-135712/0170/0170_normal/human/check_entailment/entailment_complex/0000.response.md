Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. In the function func_19, the logic for populating the list `ans` based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c` does not guarantee that adjacent elements in the final sequence will always be different. The code does not ensure that no two adjacent elements will have equal values as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it fails to meet the conditions specified in the problem description for generating the sequence p_1, p_2, â€¦, p_n.
