The function `func_20` is a predefined function that does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writing their string representations to the output stream specified by `file`, separated by the value of `sep`. It then writes the value of 'end' key from `kwargs` to the output stream. If the 'flush' key is present in `kwargs` with a value of True, it flushes the output stream. The function does not return any output.
