**Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 100. The input sequences a, b, and c are lists of n integers where each element is in the range [1, 100]. The elements in each sequence are distinct from each other and from the corresponding elements in the other sequences.**
