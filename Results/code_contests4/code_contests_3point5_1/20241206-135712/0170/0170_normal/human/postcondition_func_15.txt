The function `func_16` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns this value as the final result. The function ensures that `y` is not 0 to avoid division by zero errors. If `y` is 0, the function returns the initial value of `x` as the greatest common divisor. The function does not handle cases where both `x` and `y` are 0, which could potentially be considered as an edge case.
