The function `func_14` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The precondition for `x` is that it is a list of three sequences `a`, `b`, `c`, where each sequence is a list of `n` integers. The precondition for `y` is that it is an integer representing the number of test cases. 

The function then checks if the sum of all elements in `x` is divisible by `y`. If it is divisible, the function returns the result of `x` divided by `y`. If the sum is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of dividing `x` by `y` and adding 1 to the quotient.
