def func_1():

    #The program returns an integer obtained from the user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 prompts the user to input an integer, which it then returns. The function does not explicitly specify the input parameter, but based on the annotation, it seems to expect no input parameters and directly returns the user input as an integer. It does not handle any edge cases or validation of the input.

    #The program returns the input value without any modification
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It simply returns the input value without any modification. The function does not perform any additional operations or checks. However, the annotations mention preconditions about the values of `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i`, which are not utilized in the function itself.

def func_3():

    #The program returns a map object that applies the int function to each element after splitting the input string by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It splits the input string by spaces and applies the int function to each element, returning a map object. However, the function does not handle any potential errors that may arise from the input or conversion process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input consists of three sequences a, b, and c, each containing n integers. The integers in each sequence are distinct.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the strings of integers from the input sequences a, b, and c after splitting them by space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, splits the input by space, and converts the integers into strings. Finally, it returns a map object containing the strings of integers. The function assumes that the input consists of three sequences of distinct integers, but it does not validate the input or handle cases where the input does not meet these requirements.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, then creates a new thread that calls the `main` function. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on three sequences a, b, and c, each containing non-negative integers where no elements are equal between sequences. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** The input consists of three sequences: a list of integers a_i, a list of integers b_i, and a list of integers c_i, where each list has n elements (3 ≤ n ≤ 100).

    #The program returns a sorted list 'l' in reverse order based on the custom key function 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `l` and returns a sorted list in reverse order based on the custom key function `getKey`. It does not handle cases where `getKey` is not defined or where `l` is not a list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of elements in the sequences, m is an integer representing the number of test cases, and num is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers representing the sequences a_i, b_i, c_i.

    #The program returns a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers representing the sequences a_i, b_i, c_i repeated m times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_9 accepts integers n and m along with a list of lists num, and returns a modified list of lists where each sublist contains n integers from the original sequences a_i, b_i, c_i, repeated m times.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a sequence consisting of three sequences a, b, c, each containing n elements. Each element in a, b, c is an integer in the range [1, 100]. The length of the sequences is at least 3 and at most 100. For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i. The function then returns the result of x and not x & x - 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100. a_i, b_i, c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100.**
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of integer n after removing the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` where n is between 3 and 100 inclusive. It then converts `n` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix before returning the result. The function correctly performs this conversion for the given range of `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**:

    #The program returns the result of the combination formula C(n, r) where n is an integer between 3 and 100, r is an integer between 1 and n, and C(n, r) is calculated as n! / (r! * (n - r)!).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `n` and `r`. It calculates and returns the result of the combination formula C(n, r) using the provided formula n! / (r! * (n - r)!) where n is an integer between 3 and 100, and r is an integer between 1 and n. The function accurately computes the combination formula for the given inputs.

    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the result of dividing the list x by y and adding 1 to the quotient.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. The precondition for `x` is that it is a list of three sequences `a`, `b`, `c`, where each sequence is a list of `n` integers. The precondition for `y` is that it is an integer representing the number of test cases. 

The function then checks if the sum of all elements in `x` is divisible by `y`. If it is divisible, the function returns the result of `x` divided by `y`. If the sum is not divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of dividing `x` by `y` and adding 1 to the quotient.

    #The program returns the final result 'res' after all iterations of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs calculations on `x` and `y` based on bit manipulation and modular arithmetic. After all iterations of the loop within the function, it returns the final result `res`. The function calculates the result by iteratively updating `res`, `y`, and `x` until `y` becomes 0.

    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of x and y, which is x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns this value as the final result. The function ensures that `y` is not 0 to avoid division by zero errors. If `y` is 0, the function returns the initial value of `x` as the greatest common divisor. The function does not handle cases where both `x` and `y` are 0, which could potentially be considered as an edge case.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function then applies various conditions to n and returns True or False based on those conditions. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If n is less than or equal to 3 but greater than 1, the function returns True. If n is not divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns True after checking for prime numbers. However, there are missing cases in the annotations where the function should return False if n is divisible by certain numbers.
