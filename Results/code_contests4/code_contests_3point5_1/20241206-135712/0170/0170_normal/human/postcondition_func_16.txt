The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function then applies various conditions to n and returns True or False based on those conditions. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If n is less than or equal to 3 but greater than 1, the function returns True. If n is not divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns True after checking for prime numbers. However, there are missing cases in the annotations where the function should return False if n is divisible by certain numbers.
