The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a sequence consisting of three sequences a, b, c, each containing n elements. Each element in a, b, c is an integer in the range [1, 100]. The length of the sequences is at least 3 and at most 100. For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i. The function then returns the result of x and not x & x - 1.
