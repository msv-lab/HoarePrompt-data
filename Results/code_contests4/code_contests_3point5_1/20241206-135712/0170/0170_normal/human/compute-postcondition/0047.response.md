Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, and the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. If the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, and `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`***.
