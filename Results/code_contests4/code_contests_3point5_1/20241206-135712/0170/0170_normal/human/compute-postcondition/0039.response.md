Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1. The element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`***
