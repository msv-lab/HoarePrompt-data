Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value `c[i]`. The previous states of `n`, `ans`, and `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value `c[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value `c[i]`**
