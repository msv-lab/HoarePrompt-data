Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the file. The loop will execute another time if there are more elements in `args`, but the values of `at_start` and `args` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time, there are more elements in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute another time, there are more elements in `args`**
