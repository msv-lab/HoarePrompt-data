Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. The element at index `i - 1` of `ans` was not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, `ans[i]` is now equal to `a[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, `ans[i]` is now equal to `a[i]`**
