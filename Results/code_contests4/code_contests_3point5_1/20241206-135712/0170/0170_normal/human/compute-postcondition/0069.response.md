According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, since `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[0]` should be equal to `a[0]`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()` again**
