Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`. Since `i` is 3, the element at index 3 in `ans` is updated with the value of `c[3]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the first element assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 3, and the element at index 3 in `ans` is updated with the value of `c[3]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the first element assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 3, and the element at index 3 in `ans` is updated with the value of `c[3]`**
