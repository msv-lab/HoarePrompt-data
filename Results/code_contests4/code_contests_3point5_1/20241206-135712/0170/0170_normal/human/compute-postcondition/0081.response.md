Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The values of `ans[1]` and `a` are unaffected. After the execution, the new value of `ans[i]` will be the same as the new value of `b[i]`, as `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()` for the second time loop executes. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `a[1]`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()` again for the second loop to execute, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `a[1]`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()` again for the second loop to execute, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`**
