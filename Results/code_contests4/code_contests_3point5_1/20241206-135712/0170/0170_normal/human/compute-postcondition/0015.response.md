Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the `file`. The values of `at_start` and `args` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `file` has written the string representation of the next element in `args`.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `file` has written the string representation of the next element in `args`**
