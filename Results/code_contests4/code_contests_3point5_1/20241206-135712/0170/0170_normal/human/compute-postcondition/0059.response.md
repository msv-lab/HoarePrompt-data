Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i` of `ans` is equal to either `a[i]`, `b[i]`, or `c[i]` based on the conditions above. If `ans[i - 1] != a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is equal to `b[i]`. If `ans[i - 1] != b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is equal to `c[i]`. If `ans[i - 1] == b[i]`, then `ans[i]` remains equal to `b[i]`.***
