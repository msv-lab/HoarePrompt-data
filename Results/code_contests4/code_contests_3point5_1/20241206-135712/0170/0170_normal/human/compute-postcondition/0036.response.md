Example Answer: 
The list `ans` is initialized with `n` number of elements, where `n` is the return value of `func_1()`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros**
