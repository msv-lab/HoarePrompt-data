Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, where `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`. Therefore, `ans[i]` will be equal to the return value of `func_5()`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[i]` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`**
