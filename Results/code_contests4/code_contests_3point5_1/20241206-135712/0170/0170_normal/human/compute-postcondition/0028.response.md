Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the first element assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 3. If `ans[2]` is not equal to `a[2]`, the element at index 2 in `ans` is updated to the value of `a[2]`. Otherwise, if `ans[2]` is equal to `a[2]`, the element at index 2 in `ans` is updated with the value of `b[2]`. After the execution of the if else block, the state of the program variables is as follows: if `ans[2]` is not equal to `a[2]`, `ans[3]` is updated with the value of `a[3]`. If `ans[2]` is equal to `a[2]` and `ans[3]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then `ans[3]` is updated with the value of `b[3]`. Otherwise, `ans[3]` retains its current value.***
