According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values in `args`. Since `args` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we need to focus on the constraints provided for `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `c_i`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute `args` must be a non-empty iterable**
