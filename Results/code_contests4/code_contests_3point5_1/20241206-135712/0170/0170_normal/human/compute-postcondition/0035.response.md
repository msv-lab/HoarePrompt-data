Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, and `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`**
