According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the values of `n`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`. 
To adjust the states for the next iteration, the following conditions need to be considered:
1. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`.
2. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, then if `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`.
3. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `a[1]`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()` again for the loop to execute a second time**.
