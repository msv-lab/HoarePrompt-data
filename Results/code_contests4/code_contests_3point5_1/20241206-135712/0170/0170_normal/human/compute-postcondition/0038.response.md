According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `a`, `b`, and `c` need to have values, and the initial assignment of `ans` needs to be adjusted. Additionally, `i` needs to be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1**
