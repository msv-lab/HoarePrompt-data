Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()` again. The condition `ans[i - 1] != a[i]` is true, indicating a difference between consecutive elements in the arrays `ans` and `a`.***
