Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. The value of `ans[i]` is now equal to `a[i]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i` of `ans` is equal to `a[i]` based on the conditions above.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i` of `ans` is equal to `a[i]` based on the conditions above**
