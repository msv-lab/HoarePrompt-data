Example Answer: 
The 'end' key is popped from the kwargs dictionary and written to the file. If 'end' key exists in kwargs, its value is written, otherwise, '\n' is written. The values of 'at_start' and 'file' remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `file` has written the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep'.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `file` has written the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep'**
