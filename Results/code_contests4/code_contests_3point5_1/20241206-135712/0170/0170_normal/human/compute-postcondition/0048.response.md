According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
- `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`
- `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros
- `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`
- `i` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `n` should be greater than 1
2. The element at index `i - 1` of `ans` should not be equal to the element at index `i` of `a`

Therefore, the states to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`**
