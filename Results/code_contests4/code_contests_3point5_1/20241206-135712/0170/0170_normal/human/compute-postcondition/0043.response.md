Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `ans[1]` is now equal to `b[1]`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, and `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i`. Additionally, the value of `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and now `ans[1]` is equal to `b[1]`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements initialized with zeros, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, and `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i`. Additionally, the value of `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `ans[1]` is equal to `b[1]`.**
