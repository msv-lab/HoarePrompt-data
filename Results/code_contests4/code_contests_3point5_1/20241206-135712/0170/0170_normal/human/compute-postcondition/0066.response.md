Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes one more time, `n` is still assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()` again, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either `a[i]`, `b[i]`, or `c[i]` based on the conditions within the loop.
