Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`. The previous states of `n` and `a` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, and `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`**
