Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to 2, ans[0] is equal to a[0], for the loop to execute the first time a, b, c are assigned the return value of func_5() again, ans[i - 1] is equal to a[i]. If ans[i - 1] is not equal to b[i], then ans[i] is assigned the value of b[i]. Otherwise, if ans[i - 1] is equal to b[i], then ans[i] is assigned the value of c[i].***
