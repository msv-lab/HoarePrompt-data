Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value `b[i]`. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value `c[i]`.***
