Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `a[1]`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()` for the loop to execute a second time. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.***
