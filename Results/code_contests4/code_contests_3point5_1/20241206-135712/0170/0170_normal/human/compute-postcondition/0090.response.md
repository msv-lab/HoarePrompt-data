Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, and `a`, `b`, `c` are also assigned the return value of `func_5()`. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]` and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`.***
