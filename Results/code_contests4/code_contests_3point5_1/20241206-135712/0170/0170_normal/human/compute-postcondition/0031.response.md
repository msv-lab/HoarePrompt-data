According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the first element assigned the value of `a[0]`. All elements in `ans` are assigned values based on the conditions specified in the loop code after executing `func_20` on `ans`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the first element assigned the value of `a[0]`, after executing `func_20` on `ans`, for the loop to execute again the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0**
