Example Answer: 
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The previous states indicate that `n` is greater than 1, and the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`. After execution, the state of `ans` is updated such that the element at index `i` is now equal to the element at index `i` of `b`, maintaining the previous conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, and `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i - 1` of `ans` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `a`, `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`**
