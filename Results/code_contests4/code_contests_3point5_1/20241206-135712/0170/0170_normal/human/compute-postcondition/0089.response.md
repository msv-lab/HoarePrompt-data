Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]` and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]` based on the condition mentioned above, and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5()`.***
