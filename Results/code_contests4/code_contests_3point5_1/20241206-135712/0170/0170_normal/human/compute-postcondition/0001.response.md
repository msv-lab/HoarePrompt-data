Example Answer:
The code snippet takes two keyword arguments 'sep' and 'file' from the dictionary kwargs. If 'sep' is not provided, it defaults to ' '. If 'file' is not provided, it defaults to sys.stdout. The initial state variables t, n, a_i, b_i, c_i remain unchanged after executing the code snippet.
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100. a_i, b_i, c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i ≤ 100. a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, b_i ≠ c_i for all i.**
