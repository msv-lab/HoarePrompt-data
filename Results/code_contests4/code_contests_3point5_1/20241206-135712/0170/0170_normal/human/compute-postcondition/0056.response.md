Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The value of `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i` of `ans` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` based on the conditions above, `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, the element at index `i` of `ans` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` based on the conditions above, `ans[i]` is now equal to `b[i]`**
