The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, splits the input by space, and converts the integers into strings. Finally, it returns a map object containing the strings of integers. The function assumes that the input consists of three sequences of distinct integers, but it does not validate the input or handle cases where the input does not meet these requirements.
