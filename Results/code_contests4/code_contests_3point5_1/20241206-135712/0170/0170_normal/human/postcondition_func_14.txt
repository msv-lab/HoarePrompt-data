The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs calculations on `x` and `y` based on bit manipulation and modular arithmetic. After all iterations of the loop within the function, it returns the final result `res`. The function calculates the result by iteratively updating `res`, `y`, and `x` until `y` becomes 0.
