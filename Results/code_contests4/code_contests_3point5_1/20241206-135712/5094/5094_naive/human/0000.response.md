Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of good slices required to make all towers have the same height. It considers the restriction on slices and calculates the slices needed based on the heights of the towers. The code handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description. The logic seems sound and there are no obvious issues that would cause incorrect behavior.
