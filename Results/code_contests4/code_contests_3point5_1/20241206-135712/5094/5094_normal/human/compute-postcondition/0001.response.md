Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a Counter object `h` by mapping integers converted from input split by white spaces. The input is split into integers and then counted using the Counter function. The initial state does not provide the specific input values, so the output state will include the creation of the Counter object `h` but without specifying the exact counts of each integer.
Output State: **`h` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers from the input**
