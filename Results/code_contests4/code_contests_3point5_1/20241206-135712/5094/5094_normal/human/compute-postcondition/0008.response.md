Postcondition: ***`h` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers from the input, `tot` has been updated, `cnt`, `slices`, `min(h)` is greater than 200001, `i` is updated based on the loop iteration. If `i` is in `h`, the program continues with the updated values. Otherwise, the program exits the if else block without any changes. The sum of `cnt` and `tot` is greater than `k`.***
