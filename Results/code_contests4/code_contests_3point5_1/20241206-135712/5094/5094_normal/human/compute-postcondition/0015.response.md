Output State: **`h` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers from the input, `tot` has been updated, `cnt` is either assigned the value of `tot` + `h[i]` and `slices` is incremented by 1 if the sum of `cnt` and `tot` + `h[i]` is greater than `k`, or `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot` + `h[i]` without changing `slices` if the sum of `cnt` and `tot` + `h[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `min(h)` is greater than 200001, `i` is `i - 1` based on the loop iteration**
