Postcondition: ***`h` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers from the input, `tot` has been updated, `cnt` is assigned the value of `tot` + `h[i]` if `i` is in `h`. The value of `slices` is either incremented by 1 if the sum of `cnt` and `tot` + `h[i]` is greater than `k`, or `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot` + `h[i]` without changing `slices` if the sum of `cnt` and `tot` + `h[i]` is less than or equal to `k`. The value of `min(h)` is greater than 200001 and `i` is decremented by 1 based on the loop iteration.***
