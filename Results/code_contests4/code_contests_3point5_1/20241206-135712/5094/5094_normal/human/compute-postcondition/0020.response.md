Postcondition: ***`h` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers from the input, `tot` has been updated, `cnt` is assigned the value of `tot`. If `cnt` + `tot` > `k`, `slices` is increased by 1, `i` remains unchanged, `min(h)` is greater than 200001. If `cnt` + `tot` is less than or equal to `k`, `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot` + `h[i]`, the value of `slices` is either incremented by 1 if the sum of `cnt` and `tot` + `h[i]` is greater than `k`, or `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot` + `h[i]` without changing `slices`, `min(h)` is greater than 200001, and `i` is decremented by 1 based on the loop iteration.***
