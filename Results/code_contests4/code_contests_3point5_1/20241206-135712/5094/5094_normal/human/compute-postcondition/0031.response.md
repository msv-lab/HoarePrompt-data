Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, creates a Counter object `h` from a list of integers, and then iterates through a range of numbers. It updates `tot`, `cnt`, and `slices` based on certain conditions within the loop. After the loop, it prints the value of `slices`. However, the loop logic seems incorrect as it may not behave as per the annotations provided. It lacks clarity in terms of achieving the desired functionality based on the annotations.**
