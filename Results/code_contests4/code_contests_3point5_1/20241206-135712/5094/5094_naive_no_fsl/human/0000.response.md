Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to correctly solve the problem described. The logic in the `func_1` function is not handling the problem requirements properly. The slicing logic seems to be incorrect and may not give the minimum number of good slices required to make all towers have the same height.

An example input where the program may not work correctly:
Input:
```
3 3
2 3 5
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
In this case, the optimal solution would be to slice at height 3 for a cost of 2. But the program may not handle this case correctly.

Further analysis and debugging of the program is required to determine the exact issues and provide a correct solution.
