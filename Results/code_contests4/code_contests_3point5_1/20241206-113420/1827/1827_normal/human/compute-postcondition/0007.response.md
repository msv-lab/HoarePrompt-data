According to the code, the loop can execute again if `v` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `v` needs to be increased by 1, and `n` should still be greater than the new value of `v`.
State: **V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n, back_track contains the value of v, cmp is a list of -1 values with a length of n, v is 1, n is greater than 1, and node v has been marked as visited if it was not previously marked as visited.**
