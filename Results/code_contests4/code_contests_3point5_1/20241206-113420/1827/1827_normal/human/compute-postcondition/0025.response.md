According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `back_track` list. If the list has more elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `V`, `E`, `Q`, `used`, `cmp`, `v`, `num_cmp`, and the fact that the second last node `v` in `back_track` has not been used before are given. For the loop to execute one more time, the `back_track` list must have more elements and the next `v` in the list should be considered.
State: **`V`, `E`, `Q` are integers representing the number of nodes, edges, and queries respectively. `used` is a list of False values with a length of `n`, `back_track` is not empty and has more elements, `cmp` is a list of -1 values with a length of `n`, `v` is the last node in `back_track`, `num_cmp` is 2, and the last node `v` in `back_track` has not been used before**
