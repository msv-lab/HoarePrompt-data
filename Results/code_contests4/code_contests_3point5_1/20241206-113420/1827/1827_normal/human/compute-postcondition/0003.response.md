According to the code, the loop can execute if n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the variables V, E, Q, used, back_track, and cmp do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted as follows: V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n, back_track is an empty list, cmp is a list of -1 values with a length of n, and v is 0.
State: **V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n, back_track is an empty list, cmp is a list of -1 values with a length of n, v is 0, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0**
