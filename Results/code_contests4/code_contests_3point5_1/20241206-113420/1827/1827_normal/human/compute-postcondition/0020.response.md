Postcondition: ***`V`, `E`, `Q` are integers representing the number of nodes, edges, and queries respectively. `used` is a list of False values with a length of `n`, `back_track` is not empty, `cmp` is a list of -1 values with a length of `n`, `v` is the last node in `back_track`, `num_cmp` is 1, and the last node `v` in `back_track` has not been used before.***
