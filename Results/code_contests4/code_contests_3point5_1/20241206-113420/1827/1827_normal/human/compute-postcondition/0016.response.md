According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `back_track` is not empty. Since the loop is iterating over `back_track[::-1]`, it will execute as long as `back_track` has at least one node. 

Before the loop starts, `V`, `E`, `Q`, `used`, `cmp`, `v`, `num_cmp` are all related to the graph structure and queries, but only `back_track` and `n` are directly related to the loop execution. 

To ensure the loop executes, `back_track` should not be empty, and `v` should be set to the last node in `back_track` initially.

State: **`V` is the number of nodes, `E` is the number of edges in the graph, `Q` is the number of queries, `used` is a list of False values with a length of `n`, `back_track` is not empty, `cmp` is a list of -1 values with a length of `n`, `v` is the last node in `back_track`, `num_cmp` is 0**
