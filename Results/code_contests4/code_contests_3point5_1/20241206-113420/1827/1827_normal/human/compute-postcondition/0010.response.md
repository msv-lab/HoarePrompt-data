According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and `n`. If `v` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` should be updated to the next value, and `n` should be greater than the updated value of `v`.
State: **V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n, back_track contains the value of v, cmp is a list of -1 values with a length of n, v is 2, n is greater than 2, node v has been marked as visited if it was not previously marked as visited. If node v has not been visited before, the function proceeds.**
