Example Answer:
`used` is assigned a list of `False` values with a length of `n`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. Therefore, the Output State is: V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n.
Output State: **V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n**
