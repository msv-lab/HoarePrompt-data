The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` represents the number of nodes in the graph. The function returns two values: 
1. `num_cmp`: The number of unique nodes in `back_track`.
2. `cmp`: A list of non-negative integers representing the components of the graph. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept the number of nodes in a graph and return the number of unique nodes in `back_track` as well as the list of components of the graph.
