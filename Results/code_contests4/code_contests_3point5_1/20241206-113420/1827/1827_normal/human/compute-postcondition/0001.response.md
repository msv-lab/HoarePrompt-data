Example Answer:
Since `back_track` is initialized as an empty list, no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n, back_track is an empty list.
Output State: **V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of False values with a length of n, back_track is an empty list**
