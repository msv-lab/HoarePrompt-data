The function `func_2` recursively visits all nodes reachable from the current node `now` in a graph represented by the adjacency list `g`. It marks nodes as visited in the `used` array and appends the order of visited nodes to the `back_track` list. The function does not explicitly return any value. The provided annotations accurately describe the function's behavior.
