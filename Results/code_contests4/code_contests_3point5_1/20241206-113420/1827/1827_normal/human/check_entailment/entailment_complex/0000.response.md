Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code consists of functions that handle the creation of a directed graph, determine strongly connected components in the graph, and answer queries about whether two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component. The functions are appropriately defined and implemented based on the problem description. The annotations provided accurately describe the behavior and state of the program before and after each function call. The functions are recursive and ensure that every two nodes in a strongly connected component are mutually reachable. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and there are no obvious edge cases that are not handled. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
