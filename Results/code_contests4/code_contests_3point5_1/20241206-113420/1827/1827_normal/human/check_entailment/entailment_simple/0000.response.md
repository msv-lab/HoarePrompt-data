Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of four functions that correctly implement the algorithm to determine if two nodes in a directed graph belong to the same strongly connected component. The program performs a depth-first search on the graph to identify the strongly connected components and assigns each node to a component based on the search order.

The program correctly handles the input constraints and follows the problem description by outputting "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component and "0" otherwise for each query. The program maintains the state of visited nodes and components correctly throughout the execution, ensuring the correctness of the output.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
