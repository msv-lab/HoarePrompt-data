Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as the functions provided, it seems that the code correctly implements the functionality of determining whether two nodes in a directed graph belong to the same strongly connected component. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` work together to build the graph, track the components, and process the queries efficiently. The code handles the graph initialization, components identification, and query processing as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints align with the code logic and do not suggest any invalid cases that the code might not handle. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
