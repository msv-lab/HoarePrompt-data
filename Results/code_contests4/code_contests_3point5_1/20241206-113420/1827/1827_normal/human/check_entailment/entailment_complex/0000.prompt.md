You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: V and E are non-negative integers such that 1 <= |V| <= 10,000 and 0 <= |E| <= 30,000. Q is a positive integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100,000. Each si, ti, ui, and vi are non-negative integers corresponding to nodes in the directed graph.**
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `frm` and `to`, which are non-negative integers corresponding to nodes in a directed graph. It then adds `to` as a neighbor to the node `frm` in the graph and vice versa. There is no explicit return value specified for this function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: V is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes, E is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges, Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries. Each query pair (u, v) consists of two integers where 0 <= u,v < V.**
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: V, E, Q are non-negative integers. `used` at index `now` is True. All nodes reachable from `now` have been visited at least once and `func_2` has been called on each unvisited node.
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` recursively visits all nodes reachable from the current node `now` in a graph represented by the adjacency list `g`. It marks nodes as visited in the `used` array and appends the order of visited nodes to the `back_track` list. The function does not explicitly return any value. The provided annotations accurately describe the function's behavior.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `used[now]` is True, `cmp[now]` is assigned the value of `num_cmp` for all `now` in rg.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes parameters `now`, `num_cmp`, `used`, and `cmp`. It marks `now` as used, assigns the value of `num_cmp` to `cmp[now]`, and recursively calls itself for each neighbor of `now` in the graph `rg`. The function does not have a clear return value defined in the annotations.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, and Q is the number of queries. Each query contains a pair of nodes u and v, where u and v are integers representing nodes in the graph.**
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: V is the number of nodes, E is the number of edges in the graph, Q is the number of queries, used is a list of True values with a length of n (indicating all nodes have been visited), back_track contains the values of all nodes visited in order, cmp is a list of -1 values with a length of n, v is n-1
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `V`, `E`, `Q` are integers representing the number of nodes, edges, and queries respectively. `used` is a list of True values with a length of `n`, `back_track` is not empty, `cmp` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of `n`, `v` is the first node in `back_track`, `num_cmp` is equal to the number of unique nodes in `back_track`, and all nodes in `back_track` have been visited at least once.
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the number of unique nodes in `back_track` as `num_cmp` and the list of non-negative integers `cmp` representing the components of the graph
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts a parameter n, representing the number of nodes in a graph. It initializes lists used, back_track, and cmp with False values, an empty list, and -1 values respectively. It then iterates over the nodes, marking them as used and appending them to back_track. After that, it resets the used list, counts the number of unique nodes in back_track, and assigns components to each node in cmp. The function returns the number of unique nodes in back_track as num_cmp and the list of components of the graph as cmp. The functionality accurately reflects the code execution.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
