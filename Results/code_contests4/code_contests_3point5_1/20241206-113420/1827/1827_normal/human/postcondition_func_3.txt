The function func_4 accepts a parameter n, representing the number of nodes in a graph. It initializes lists used, back_track, and cmp with False values, an empty list, and -1 values respectively. It then iterates over the nodes, marking them as used and appending them to back_track. After that, it resets the used list, counts the number of unique nodes in back_track, and assigns components to each node in cmp. The function returns the number of unique nodes in back_track as num_cmp and the list of components of the graph as cmp. The functionality accurately reflects the code execution.
