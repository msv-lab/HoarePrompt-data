Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input for a directed graph and a sequence of queries.
2. It then uses the functions func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4 to find strongly connected components in the graph.
3. Finally, it compares the components of the given query nodes and prints 1 if they belong to the same strongly connected component, and 0 otherwise.
4. The program correctly identifies whether two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component based on the graph structure and the given queries.
5. The functions used in the program handle the traversal and identification of strongly connected components accurately.
6. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given example.

Overall, the program seems to be correctly implemented and meets the requirements of the problem description.
