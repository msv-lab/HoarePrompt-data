Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input graph and queries.
2. The program uses Kosaraju's algorithm to find the strongly connected components of the graph.
3. For each query, the program correctly checks if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component and outputs "1" if they do and "0" otherwise.
4. The program uses the correct approach to determine the strongly connected components and checks for each query, ensuring that every two nodes are reachable from each other within the same strongly connected component.
