Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input as described, calculates the number of tokens of each type, determines the color to be changed to for a draw configuration, and updates the grid accordingly. The program ensures that the grid is transformed into a draw configuration in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations. The logic seems sound and there are no evident cases where the program would fail to produce the expected output based on the problem description.
