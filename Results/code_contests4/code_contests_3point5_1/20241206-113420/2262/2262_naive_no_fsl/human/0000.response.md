Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input as described in the problem statement.
2. It processes the input correctly by determining the total number of tokens in the grid, calculating the number of operations needed to make the grid a draw, and changing the tokens accordingly.
3. The program ensures that the grid becomes a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations.
4. The logic to change tokens from X to O based on the color selection is implemented correctly.
5. The program outputs the final state of the grid after applying the operations for each test case.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the expected output for the given input.
