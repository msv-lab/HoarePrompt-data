You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type O do not appear in the input of the easy version.

Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.

In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are n rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: X and O. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.

<image> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations. The patterns in the second row are draw configurations. 

In an operation, you can change an X to an O, or an O to an X. Let k denote the total number of tokens in the grid. Your task is to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ (rounding down) operations.

You are not required to minimize the number of operations.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) — the size of the grid.

The following n lines each contain a string of n characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the i-th row and j-th column is '.' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: 'X' or 'O'.

It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.

In the easy version, the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

Output

For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.

We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

..X..

Note

In the first test case, there are initially three 'X' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to 'O' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed 1≤ ⌊ 5/3⌋ token.

In the second test case, we change only 9≤ ⌊ 32/3⌋ tokens, and there does not exist any three 'X' or 'O' consecutive in a row or column, so it is a draw.

In the third test case, we change only 3≤ ⌊ 12/3⌋ tokens, and the resulting grid is a draw.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value obtained from user input. It reads an integer value from the user input and returns it as the output.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, the grid is a list of strings of length n where each string consists of characters '.' or 'X'.**
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values that are split by spaces to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values separated by spaces, converts them to integers, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not handle cases where the input values are not integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the size of the grid, and the grid is represented by a 2D list of characters containing 'X' or '.' only.**
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list of characters from the grid, excluding the last character in each row
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads input from the user and returns a list of characters from the input string, excluding the last character. The function does not accept any parameters. The grid mentioned in the annotations is not utilized in the code, and there is no specific handling for test cases or grid sizes.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the grid, and the grid is represented as a 2D list of characters where each character is either 'X' or '.'. The character 'O' does not appear in the grid for the easy version.
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns a string 's' excluding the last character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads an input string, and then returns a new string that is the input string excluding the last character. The function does not accept any parameters, and it does not process a predefined grid as mentioned in the annotations. Instead, it simply operates on an input string.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. Each test case grid contains only the characters '.', 'X', and 'O'.**

The loop will execute until `use_clr` reaches 3 or the conditions related to `cnt` and `K` are met. After the loop finishes, `use_clr` will be the total number of times the loop executed.

If `n` is less than or equal to 0, then `k` will be 0, `K` will be 0.0, `clr` will be an empty dictionary, `cnt` will be `[0, 0, 0]`, and `use_clr` will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` initializes a matrix `M` based on the return value of functions `func_1` and `func_3`. It then calculates the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the matrix elements. The function determines a color to use based on the sum and modifies the matrix elements accordingly. Finally, it prints the updated matrix. If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function will have specific default values for `k`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, and `use_clr`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
