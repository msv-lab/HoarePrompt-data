Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by taking the input of the grid, determining the number of operations needed to make the grid a draw, changing the tokens in the grid to achieve the draw configuration, and then outputting the modified grid. The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed ⌊ k/3⌋ and guarantees that a solution always exists. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
