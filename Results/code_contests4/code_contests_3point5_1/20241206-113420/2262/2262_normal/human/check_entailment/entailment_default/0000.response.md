Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases and then proceeds to read the size of the grid and the initial grid configuration for each test case.
- It calculates the total number of tokens in the grid and determines the number of operations needed to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations.
- It then assigns colors to the cells based on the sum of 'X' occurrences and modifies the grid to achieve a draw configuration.
- The code iterates through the grid, changes the tokens according to the color assigned, and prints the updated grid.
- The code seems to follow the problem description for every potential case and the output hints align with the code logic without providing any contradictory scenarios.
