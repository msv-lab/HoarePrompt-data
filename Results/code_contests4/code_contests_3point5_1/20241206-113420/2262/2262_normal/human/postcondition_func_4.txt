The function `func_5` initializes a matrix `M` based on the return value of functions `func_1` and `func_3`. It then calculates the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the matrix elements. The function determines a color to use based on the sum and modifies the matrix elements accordingly. Finally, it prints the updated matrix. If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function will have specific default values for `k`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, and `use_clr`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
