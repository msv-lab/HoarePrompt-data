Postcondition: ***After the loop executes again, k is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in all elements of M, K is the integer division result of k divided by 3.0, clr contains key-value pairs where clr[i, j] is equal to (i + j) % 3 for each valid i and j, cnt is a list of three elements where each element represents the count of occurrences of (i + j) % 3 for each valid i and j, i is increased by 1 and should be less than n, for the loop to execute j is less than n, and M[i][j] is not equal to 'X'***
