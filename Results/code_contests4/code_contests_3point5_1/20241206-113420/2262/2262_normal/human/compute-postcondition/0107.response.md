Postcondition: ***`k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j`, and `M` are all appropriately updated. If `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, `k` is updated, `n` is at least 0, `K` is the integer division result of updated `k` divided by 3.0, `clr` contains key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list of three elements, `use_clr` is incremented by 2, `chg` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the current value of `j`, and the value 'O' is assigned to `M[i][j']`, where `j'` is the updated value of `j`.***
