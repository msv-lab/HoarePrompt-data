Output State: **`k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j`, and `M` are all appropriately updated after all iterations of the loop have finished. The values of the variables reflect the changes made during each iteration, and `M[i][j]` is assigned 'O' for each iteration where `clr[i, j]` equals `use_clr`.**
