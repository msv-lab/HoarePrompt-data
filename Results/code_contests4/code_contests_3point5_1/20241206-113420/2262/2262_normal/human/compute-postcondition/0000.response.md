Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300, each test case grid contains only the characters '.', 'X', and 'O'.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300, each test case grid contains only the characters '.', 'X', and 'O'**
