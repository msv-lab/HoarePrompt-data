Postcondition: ***All variables `k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `i` are updated appropriately, `j` is incremented by 1 within the range of `n`, `clr[i, j] == use_clr`, `chg` is increased by 2 if `clr[i, j] == use_clr`, and `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O' after the execution of the if else block.***
