According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j`, and `M` have been updated appropriately. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **All variables `k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j`, and `M` are updated appropriately after all iterations of the loop have finished. The values of the variables reflect the changes made during each iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1 and `n` should be greater than the new value of `i`.**
