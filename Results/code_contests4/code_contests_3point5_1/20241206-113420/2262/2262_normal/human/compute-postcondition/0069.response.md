Example Answer: 
The code increments the count of the remainder of `(i + j) % 3` in the `cnt` array by 1. The values of `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`. The `clr` variable is updated based on the formula `(i + j) % 3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr` is updated based on the formula `(i + j) % 3`, `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 and less than `n`, and the count of remainders in `cnt` array is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`clr` is updated based on the formula `(i + j) % 3`, `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 and less than `n`, and the count of remainders in `cnt` array is updated accordingly**
