Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `k`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `i`, and `j` are updated based on the specified conditions and formulas. For the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and less than `n`, `j` is increased by 1 and less than `n`, and the conditions in matrix `M` are satisfied. If `M[i][j] == 'X'`, then `clr` is updated based on the formula `(i + j) % 3`, `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 and less than `n`, and the count of remainders in `cnt` array is updated accordingly. If `M[i][j] != 'X'`, then `clr[i, j]` is updated to -1.***
