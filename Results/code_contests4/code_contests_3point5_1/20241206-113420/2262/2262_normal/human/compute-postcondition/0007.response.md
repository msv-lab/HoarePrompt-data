Example Answer:
The function `func_3()` is called and its return value is appended to the list `M`. The sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M` is added to the current value of `k`. The loop will then execute another time. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M` for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M` for the loop to execute another time**
