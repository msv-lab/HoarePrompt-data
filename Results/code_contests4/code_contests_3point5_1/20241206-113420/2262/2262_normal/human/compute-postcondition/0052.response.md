Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in all elements of `M`, `K` is the integer division result of `k` divided by 3.0, `clr` contains key-value pairs where `clr[i, j]` is equal to `(i + j) % 3` for each valid `i` and `j`, `cnt` is a list of three elements where each element represents the count of occurrences of `(i + j) % 3` for each valid `i` and `j`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the current value of `j+1. If M[i][j] == 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value of `(i + j) % 3`, and `cnt[(i + j) % 3]` is incremented by 1. If M[i][j] != 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1.***
