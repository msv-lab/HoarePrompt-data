Output State: **All variables `k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j`, and `M` are updated appropriately after all iterations of the loop have finished. For the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is within the range of `n`, and if `clr[i, j]` is equal to `use_clr`, then `chg` is increased by 1. Now, `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O'.**
