Example Answer:
`M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O', `k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j` are all incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the updated value of `j`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `M[i][j]` is assigned 'O', for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`k`, `n`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `use_clr`, `chg`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `M[i][j]` is assigned 'O', for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the updated value of `j`**
