Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `k`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `i`, and `j` are updated based on the specified conditions and formulas. The loop continues to execute with the updated variables, ensuring that `i` is increased by 1 and less than `n`, `j` is less than `n`, and the conditions in matrix `M` are satisfied.***
