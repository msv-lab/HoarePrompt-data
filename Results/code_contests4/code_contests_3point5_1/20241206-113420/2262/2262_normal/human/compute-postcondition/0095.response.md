Example Answer:
`chg` is incremented by 1. Since `chg` is the only variable that changes, the output state is: After the execution of the if else block, all variables remain the same except `chg`, which is further incremented by 3.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, all variables remain the same except `chg`, which is further incremented by 3.**
