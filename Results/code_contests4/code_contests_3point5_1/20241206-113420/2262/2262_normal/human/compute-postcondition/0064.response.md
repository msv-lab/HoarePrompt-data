Example Answer:
The count at index `(i + j) % 3` in the `cnt` list is incremented by 1. The affected variables are `cnt`, `i`, and `j`. Since the formula `(i + j) % 3` is used, the value of `i` and `j` will be crucial in determining which index of `cnt` will be updated. The conditions `i` should be less than `n` and `j` should be less than `n` are mentioned, so the loop will continue until those conditions are met in the matrix `M`. The values of `k`, `K`, and `clr` do not change based on the provided code snippet.
Output State: **`k` is updated, `K` is calculated, `clr` is updated based on the formula `(i + j) % 3`, `cnt` is updated based on the loop conditions and the formula `(i + j) % 3`, `i` is increased by 1 and should be less than `n`, `j` is less than `n`, and the specified conditions are met in matrix `M`**
