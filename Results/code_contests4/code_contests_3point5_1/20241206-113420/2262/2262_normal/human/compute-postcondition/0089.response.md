According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chg` is incremented by 1, all other variables remain the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, `chg` is further incremented by 1.
State: **After the execution of the if else block, all variables remain the same except `chg` which is further incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
