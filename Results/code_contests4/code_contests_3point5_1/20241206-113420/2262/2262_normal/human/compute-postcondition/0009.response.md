According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than 0**
