Example Answer:
`k` is updated by adding the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of list `M`. The value of `M` is not given, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `k`. 
Output State: **`k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M` for the loop to execute another time**.
