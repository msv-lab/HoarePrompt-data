Since the loop continues to execute with updated variables, we need to ensure that `i` is increased by 1 and less than `n`, `j` is less than `n`, and the conditions in matrix `M` are satisfied for the next iteration.

State: **After the if-else block executes, `k`, `K`, `clr`, `cnt`, `i`, and `j` are updated based on the specified conditions and formulas. For the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and less than `n`, `j` is increased by 1 and less than `n`, and the conditions in matrix `M` are satisfied.**
