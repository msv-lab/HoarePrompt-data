Postcondition: ***`k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is greater than 0, `K` is the integer division result of `k` divided by 3.0, `clr` has a new key-value pair where `clr[i, j]` is equal to `(i + j) % 3`, `cnt` is a list of three elements where the element at index `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 1 or 3 depending on the condition, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time. If `M[i][j]` is 'X', `cnt` at index `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 2. If `M[i][j]` is not 'X', `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value -1.***
