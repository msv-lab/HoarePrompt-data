Postcondition: ***`k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in all elements of `M`, `n` is greater than 0, `K` is the integer division result of `k` divided by 3.0, `clr` has a new key-value pair where `clr[i, j]` is equal to `(i + j) % 3`, `cnt` is a list of three elements where the element at index `(i + j) % 3` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `M[i][j]` is equal to 'X', else `clr` has a new key-value pair (i, j) with a value of -1, `cnt` is a list of three elements initialized to 0, `M[i][j]` is not equal to 'X'.***
