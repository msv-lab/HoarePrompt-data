Example Answer:
The value at index (i, j) in the matrix `clr` is updated to -1. The loop will continue to execute as long as the conditions are met. Variables `k`, `K`, `cnt`, and `i` are updated as specified. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n` and `j` is less than `n` while meeting the conditions in matrix `M`.
Output State: **Variables are updated as specified, loop continues to execute based on conditions**
