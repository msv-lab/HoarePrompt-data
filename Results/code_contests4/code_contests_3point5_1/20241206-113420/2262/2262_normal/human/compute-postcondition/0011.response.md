Example Answer:
The value of `k` is updated by adding the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M`. The loop will execute another time only if `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute another time, `n` must be greater than 0.
Output State: **`k` is updated by the sum of occurrences of 'X' or 'O' in the last element of `M`, for the loop to execute another time, `n` must be greater than 0**
