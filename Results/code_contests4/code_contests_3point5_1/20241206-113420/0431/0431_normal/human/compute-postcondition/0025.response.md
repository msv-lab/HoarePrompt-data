The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `k`. Parameter `a` is a list of integers, and `k` is an integer. The program calculates the sum of all elements in list `a`, divides it by `k` using integer division, and considers any remainder as an additional bag. The function then returns the number of bags obtained after this calculation. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`, perform the specified division operation, and return the number of bags obtained. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`, calculates the sum of all elements in `a`, performs integer division by `k`, and returns the number of bags obtained, considering any remainder as an additional bag.**
