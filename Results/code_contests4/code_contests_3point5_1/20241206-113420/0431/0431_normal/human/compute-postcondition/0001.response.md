Example Answer:
The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes input, splits it by space, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `_` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` and `k` are assigned integer values based on the input, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`_` and `k` are assigned integer values based on the input, `a` is a list of integers**
