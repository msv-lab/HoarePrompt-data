Example Answer:
The value of `carry` is assigned the remainder of `i` divided by `k`. The value of `bags` is increased by the integer division of `i` by `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `bags` is increased by the integer division of `i` by `k, `carry` is the remainder of `i` divided by `k.
Output State: **`bags` is increased by the integer division of `i` by `k, `carry` is the remainder of `i` divided by `k**
