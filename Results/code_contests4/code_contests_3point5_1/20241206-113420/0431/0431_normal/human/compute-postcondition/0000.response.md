Example Answer: 
`_, k` is assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split(' '))`, where `input().split(' ')` splits the input by spaces and `map(int, ...)` converts each element to an integer. The values of `_` and `k` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` and `k` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`_` and `k` are assigned integer values based on the input**
