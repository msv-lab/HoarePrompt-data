Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions - `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage for the given days, while `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` twice to find the minimum number of bags for both the original list and the reversed list, and prints the minimum of the two.

The `func_1` function iterates through the list of garbage produced each day, calculates the number of bags needed based on the capacity of each bag, and keeps track of any remaining garbage that can be carried over to the next day. It ensures that all garbage is disposed of over the given days. The program follows the problem description accurately for all cases, ensuring that the correct minimum number of bags is calculated.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True** as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
