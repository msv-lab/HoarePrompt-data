You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Enough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.

For each of next n days Vasya knows a_i — number of units of garbage he will produce on the i-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to k units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.

Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given n days. No garbage should be left after the n-th day.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains n space separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of units of garbage produced on the i-th day.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Each unit of garbage should be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the n-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, k):
    bags, carry = 0, 0
    for i in a:
        if carry != 0:
            bags += 1
            i = max(0, i - carry)
        
        bags += i // k
        
        carry = i % k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bags` will be increased by the integer division of the sum of all elements in list `a` by `k`, `carry` will be the remainder of the sum of all elements in list `a` divided by `k`, `a` will be an empty list, and `i` will be 0
    if (carry != 0) :
        bags += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`bags` will be increased by the integer division of the sum of all elements in list `a` by `k` and `carry` will be the remainder of the sum of all elements in list `a` divided by `k`. The list `a` will remain empty, `i` will be 0, and if `carry` is not equal to 0, `bags` will be increased by 1.
    return bags
    #The program returns the number of bags after the integer division of the sum of all elements in list `a` by `k`, considering any remainder as an additional bag
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`. It iterates through the elements of `a`, calculating the sum and dividing it by `k` to determine the number of bags. If there is a remainder after division, an additional bag is added. The function returns the total number of bags required.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    _, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(min(func_1(a, k), func_1(a[::-1], k)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input values from the user, calculates two minimum values by calling `func_1` with different arguments, and prints the smaller of the two results. It does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
