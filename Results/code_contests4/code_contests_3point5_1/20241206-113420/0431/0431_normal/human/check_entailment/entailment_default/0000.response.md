# Initial Assessment:
The code seems to address the problem description by calculating the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage produced over a given number of days. It considers the bag's capacity `k` and the number of units of garbage produced each day. The code iterates through the list of garbage produced each day and calculates the required number of bags based on the bag's capacity.

# Output hints evaluation:
The output hints seem to provide a good understanding of the code functionality and the problem it is trying to solve. They describe the input structure, the calculation process, and the final output. The hints also mention that the function `func_1` returns the total number of bags required for garbage disposal.

# Decision:
The code appears to follow the problem description and the output hints provide additional clarity on the code's purpose. I have evaluated the code along with the provided examples and could not find any edge cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
