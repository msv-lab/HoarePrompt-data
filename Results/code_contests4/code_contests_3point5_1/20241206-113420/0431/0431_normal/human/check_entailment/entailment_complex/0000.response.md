Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions. 
- `func_1(a, k)`: This function calculates the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage for the given days. It iterates through the list `a` of garbage units produced each day, calculates the number of bags needed based on the capacity `k`, and handles any remainder by adding an extra bag if necessary. The function returns the total number of bags required.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the input values, calls `func_1` twice with different arguments (one with the original list `a` and one with the reversed list `a`), calculates the minimum number of bags needed for both cases, and prints the smaller value.

The code follows the problem description accurately by considering the constraints of the number of days, bag capacity, and the number of units of garbage produced each day. It ensures that no garbage is left after the last day and calculates the minimum number of bags required to dispose of all garbage.

There are no potential cases identified where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
