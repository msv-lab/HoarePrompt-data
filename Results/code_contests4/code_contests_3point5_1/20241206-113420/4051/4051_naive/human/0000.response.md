Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for the number of toys and the expected total cost of the pair of toys. It then calculates the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition where the total cost is k burles. The logic used in the program is correct and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

1. If n >= k, it calculates x as k - 1 and prints max(0, x // 2). This handles the cases where Tanechka can choose a pair of toys within the given range.
2. If n < k, it calculates l as k - n and then calculates l as n - l + 1 before printing max(0, l // 2). This handles the cases where Tanechka needs to choose pairs with total cost more than the available toys.

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition, considering all possible scenarios.
