Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. When considering the input `(8, 5)`, the code should output `2` as there are two ways to choose a pair of toys with a total cost of 5 burles: (1, 4) and (2, 3). However, the code incorrectly outputs `1`. This discrepancy shows that the code is not handling all cases as per the problem description.
