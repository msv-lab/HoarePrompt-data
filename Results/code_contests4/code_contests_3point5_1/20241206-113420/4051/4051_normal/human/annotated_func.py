#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^14.**
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr
    #The program returns the list of integers 'arr' input by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user to input a list of integers 'arr' and returns this list as the output. The function does not accept any parameters. The implementation successfully reads the user input into a list of integers and returns it.
