Example Answer:
The code snippet takes an input of a list of integers and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. Since the initial state does not specify any previous values for `arr`, the output state is solely dependent on the input provided.
Output State: **`arr` contains the list of integers input by the user**
