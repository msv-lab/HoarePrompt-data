            #The program returns the result of calling function func_1 with parameters x and y % x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It then recursively calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is 0, it returns `y`. If `x` is less than `y` and the remainder of dividing `y` by `x` is 0, it returns `x`. In all other cases, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until one of the base cases is met.

def func_2(x4):
    if (len(x4) > 2) :
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
        #The program returns the result of applying 'func_1' to the first two elements of collection 'x4', then passing the result along with the rest of the elements of 'x4' to 'func_2'
    else :
        if (len(x4) == 2) :
            return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
            #The program returns the result of calling function `func_1` with the first and second characters of the string `x4`
        else :
            return x4[0]
            #The program returns the first character of the string `x4`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a parameter `x4`, which can be a collection or a string. 
- If the length of `x4` is greater than 2, it applies `func_1` to the first two elements of `x4` and recursively calls `func_2` with the result and the rest of the elements.
- If the length of `x4` is 2, it calls `func_1` with the first and second elements of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is less than 2, it returns the first element of `x4`.
The function's behavior is based on the length and content of `x4`, performing different operations accordingly.
