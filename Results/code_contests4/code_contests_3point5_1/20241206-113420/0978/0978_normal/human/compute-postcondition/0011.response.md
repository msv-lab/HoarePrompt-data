Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It then recursively calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is 0, it returns `y`. If `x` is less than `y` and the remainder of dividing `y` by `x` is 0, it returns `x`. In all other cases, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until one of the base cases is met.**
