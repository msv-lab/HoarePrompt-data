The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are integers. After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following cases:

Case_1: If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is 0, the function returns the integer `y`.
Case_2: If the condition in Case_1 is not met, the function returns the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y`.
Case_3: If `x` is less than `y` and the remainder of dividing `y` by `x` is 0, the function returns the integer `x`.
Case_4: If the conditions in Case_1 and Case_3 are not met, the function returns the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `x` and `y % x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and return different values based on the conditions specified in each case.
