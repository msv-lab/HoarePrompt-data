Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes a parameter `x4`, which can be a collection or a string. 
- If the length of `x4` is greater than 2, it applies `func_1` to the first two elements of `x4` and recursively calls `func_2` with the result and the rest of the elements.
- If the length of `x4` is 2, it calls `func_1` with the first and second elements of `x4`.
- If the length of `x4` is less than 2, it returns the first element of `x4`.
The function's behavior is based on the length and content of `x4`, performing different operations accordingly.**
