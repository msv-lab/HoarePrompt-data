Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This function correctly returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers as required by the problem description.

`func_2` recursively applies `func_1` to pairs of numbers in a list until only one number remains, which is then returned. This process is repeated until the length of the list is less than or equal to 2. 

The program correctly follows the problem description by implementing the required mathematical operations to find the greatest common divisor of multiple numbers.
