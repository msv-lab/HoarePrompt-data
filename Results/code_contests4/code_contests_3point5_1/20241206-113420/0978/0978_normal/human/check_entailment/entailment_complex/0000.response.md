Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the problem description, it can be observed that the code implements the required functionality correctly. The program defines two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that work together to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and apply it to a collection of numbers.

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are appropriately defined and structured to handle the recursive calculation of the GCD and the application of the calculation to a collection of numbers. The annotations provided for each function accurately describe their purpose and behavior, aligning with the actual code implementation.

Since the code structure and logic match the problem description, and there are no apparent discrepancies or edge cases that are not covered, the correctness of the program can be confirmed as **True**.
