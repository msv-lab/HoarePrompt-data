Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of integers. It then takes input for the grid of coins and calculates the number of cells containing an even number of coins based on the provided operations. The program seems to follow the problem description accurately, as it performs the required operations to maximize the number of cells with an even number of coins. Additionally, the program handles the input format specified in the problem description. Overall, the program appears to be correct as it aligns with the requirements of the problem statement.
