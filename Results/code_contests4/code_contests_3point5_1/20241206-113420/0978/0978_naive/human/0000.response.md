Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program seems to be performing some calculations based on the input values, but it does not output the required sequence of operations to maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins. This means that the output format and the logic of the program are not aligned with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is marked as False.
