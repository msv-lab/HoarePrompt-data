Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the required maximal xor of a segment of consecutive elements as per the problem description. It iterates through all possible segments and calculates the xor value. It then keeps track of the maximum xor value found so far and updates it if a higher xor value is found. The logic seems correct and the program should work as expected for all test cases.
