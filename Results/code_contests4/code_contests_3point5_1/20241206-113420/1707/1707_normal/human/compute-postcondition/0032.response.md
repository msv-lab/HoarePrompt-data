According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated to the new maximum XOR value, `n` is at least `i+1`, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 and `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`ans` is updated to the new maximum XOR value, `n` is at least `i+1`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute another time `i` is greater than 0**
