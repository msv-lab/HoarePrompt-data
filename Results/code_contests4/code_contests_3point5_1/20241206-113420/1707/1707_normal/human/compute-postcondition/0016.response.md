According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements of `s` to integers and adding 0 at the beginning, `i` is greater than 0, element at index 0 in list `a` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the element at index -1, `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of the XOR operation between element at index `i` and element at index `j`, `j` is less than `i`**
