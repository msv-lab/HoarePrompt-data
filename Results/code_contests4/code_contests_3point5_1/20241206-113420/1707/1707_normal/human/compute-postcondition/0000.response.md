Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, after execution, `n` will hold a positive integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer**
