According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. In this case, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements of `s` to integers and adding 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1, element at index `0` in list `a` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the element at index `-1`, `ans` is 0**
