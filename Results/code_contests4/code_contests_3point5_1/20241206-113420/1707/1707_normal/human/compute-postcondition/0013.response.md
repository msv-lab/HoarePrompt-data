Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements of `s` to integers and adding 0 at the beginning, `i` is greater than 0, element at index 0 in list `a` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the element at index -1, `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of the XOR operation between element at index `i` and element at index `j`**
