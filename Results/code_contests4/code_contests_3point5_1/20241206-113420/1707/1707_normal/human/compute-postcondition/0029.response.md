Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value of XOR operations between all pairs of elements in list `a` after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is at least `i+1`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute another time `i` is greater than 0, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` value and the XOR result of `a[i]` and `a[j]`.**
