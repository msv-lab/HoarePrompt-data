Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the user input, then reads a list of strings `s` and converts them to integers, storing them in list `a`. It performs XOR operations on adjacent elements in list `a`. Finally, it calculates the maximum XOR value between all pairs of elements in list `a` and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the maximum XOR value calculated.**
