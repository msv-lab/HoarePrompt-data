According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times where `n` is the total number of elements in list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operations between all pairs of elements in list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop will iterate for the `n+1`th time. 
State: **`ans` is the maximum value of XOR operations between all pairs of elements in list `a` after all the iterations of the loop have finished, for the loop to execute another time `n` should be at least `n+1`**
