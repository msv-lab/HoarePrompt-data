Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `split()` splits the input based on whitespace. As `n` is a positive integer, the value of `s` will be a list of strings. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings**
