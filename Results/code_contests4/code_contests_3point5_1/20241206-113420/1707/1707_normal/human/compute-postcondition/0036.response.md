Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans`. Since there are no operations in the code that affect the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value of XOR operations between all pairs of elements in list `a` after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is the total number of iterations of the outer loop, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `i-1`, for the loop to execute another time `i` should be less than the length of list `a`**
