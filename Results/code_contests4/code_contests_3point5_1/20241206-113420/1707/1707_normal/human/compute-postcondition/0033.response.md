Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the new maximum XOR value between `a[i]` and `a[j]`. `n` is at least `i+1`, `j` is fixed at 2, and for the loop to execute another time, `i` must be greater than 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated to the new maximum XOR value, `n` is at least `i+1`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute another time `i` is greater than 0**
