Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements of `s` to integers and adding 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. The element at index `i` in list `a` is updated by performing XOR operation between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1`.**
