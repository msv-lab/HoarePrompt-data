Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given problem description states that the team of workers will asphalt both roads at an intersection if none of the two roads that form the intersection were already asphalted. If at least one of the roads was already asphalted, the team will leave the intersection without doing anything. 

The provided code seems to correctly implement this logic by iterating through the given schedule of intersections and checking whether both roads have been asphalted or not. If both roads have not been asphalted, the code proceeds to asphalt both roads. Otherwise, it skips the intersection and moves to the next one.

Since the code adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, we can conclude that the correctness of the program is true.
