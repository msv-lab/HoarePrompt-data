Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program provided does not contain any implementation details within the `func` function. As a result, the program does not perform the necessary actions to process the schedule of intersections and determine the days when road works will be in progress. Since the function does not have any code to check for whether roads are asphalted or not, it cannot determine the correct days when road works will be in progress. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
