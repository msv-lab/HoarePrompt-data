#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The schedule contains n^2 distinct intersections represented by pairs of horizontal and vertical road numbers.**
def func():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is responsible for processing a schedule containing n^2 distinct intersections represented by pairs of horizontal and vertical road numbers. The function does not have a specified return value. It is important to note that the function does not handle any cases where n is outside the range of 1 to 50. Additionally, the function lacks implementation details within the function body, as it is empty.
