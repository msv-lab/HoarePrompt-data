Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly calculate the number of cyclic permutations of length n modulo 10^9+7. 

To illustrate this, let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

Input:
4

Expected Output:
16

However, when we run the program with the input 4, it does not produce the correct output. The program calculates the result as print(ans - 2 ** (n - 1)) % mod, which does not correspond to the correct calculation of the number of cyclic permutations.

Therefore, based on the discrepancy in the expected output and the output produced by the program for the given example, the correctness of the program is **False**.
