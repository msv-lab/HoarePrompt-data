#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained from the user input, which should be an integer between 3 and 10^6 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 prompts the user to input an integer value, which is then returned by the function. The input must be an integer between 3 and 10^6 inclusive.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values that are split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and takes no input arguments. It reads an input string, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input or error handling.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.**
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of the input string 's' except for the last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an input string 's' and returns a list containing all characters of 's' except for the last character. The function does not accept any parameters. It operates on the input string 's' provided through user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. The actual functionality of the function is to take an input, split it into integers, and return a map object containing those integers. The function does not have any validation or error handling for incorrect inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string 's' based on the space character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 reads input from the user as a string, then splits the string based on the space character and returns a list of substrings. The function does not accept any parameters.

If `n` is equal to 1, then `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than `cap`, and `cap` is the square root of `n` after the loop finishes.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If n is not equal to 1, then ans is a list containing all the prime factors of n with the newly appended value, i is greater than cap, and cap is the square root of n for the loop to terminate.

    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing all the prime factors of n or an empty list if n is equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts an integer `n` within the range 3 <= n <= 10^6. If n is equal to 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If n is not equal to 1, the function calculates and returns a list containing all the prime factors of n. If n does not have any prime factors, the function returns an empty list.

        a = math.factorial(n)
        b = math.factorial(k)
        c = math.factorial(n - k)
        div = a // (b * c)
        return div
        #The program returns the value of div calculated based on the factorials of n, k, and n - k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The constraints for `n` are that it must be an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. 

After executing the function body, there are three possible return cases:

Case 1: The program always returns 1.
Case 2: The program returns 0.
Case 3: The program returns the value of `div` calculated based on the factorials of `n`, `k`, and `n - k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` satisfies the constraint 3 <= n <= 10^6, and then return 1, 0, or the calculated value of `div` based on the factorials of `n`, `k`, and `n - k`.
