Example Answer:
The code calculates the factorial of `n` using the `math.factorial()` function. Since `n` is between 3 and 10^6 and not equal to 1, the factorial of `n` will be a large integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, n is not equal to 1 and n is not equal to k; `a` is the factorial of n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, n is not equal to 1 and n is not equal to k; `a` is the factorial of n**.
