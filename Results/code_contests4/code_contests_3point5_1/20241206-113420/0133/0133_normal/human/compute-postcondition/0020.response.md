According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `cap`. If `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is not divisible by `i`, and `i` is less than `cap`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `cap` should be assigned the square root of `n`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `cap` is the square root of `n` for the loop to execute again**
