Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 1, ans is a list containing all the prime factors of n, i is greater than cap, and cap is the square root of n for the loop to terminate. If n is equal to 1, then ans is an empty list, i is greater than cap, and cap is the square root of n after the loop finishes. Additionally, n is greater than 1.***
