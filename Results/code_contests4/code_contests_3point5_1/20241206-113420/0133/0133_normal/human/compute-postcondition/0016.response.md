Example Answer:
The value of `n` is updated to `n // i`, which means the integer division of `n` by `i`. The previous values of `n`, `ans`, `i`, and `cap` are relevant. If `n` is divisible by `i`, `ans` will contain the factors of `n` that meet the condition. If not, `ans` will be an empty list. The value of `i` will be incremented by 1. The loop will continue until `i` is less than `cap` and `n` is not divisible by `i`. 
Output State: **`n` is updated, `ans` may contain factors of `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cap` remains the same**
