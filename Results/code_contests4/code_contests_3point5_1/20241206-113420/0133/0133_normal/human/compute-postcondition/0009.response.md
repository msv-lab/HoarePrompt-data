Example Answer:
The value of `div` is calculated by dividing the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorial of `k` and the factorial of `n - k`. Since the initial states are not provided for `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot directly calculate the value of `div`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, n is not equal to 1 and n is not equal to k; `a` is the factorial of n, `b` is the factorial of k, `c` is the factorial of n - k.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, n is not equal to 1 and n is not equal to k; `a` is the factorial of n, `b` is the factorial of k, `c` is the factorial of n - k**
