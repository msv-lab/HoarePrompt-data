Example Answer:
The value of `c` is assigned the factorial of `n - k`. Since `n` and `k` are not equal, the value of `n - k` is not 0, and therefore `c` is the factorial of a non-zero integer. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, n is not equal to 1 and n is not equal to k; `a` is the factorial of n, `b` is the factorial of k, `c` is the factorial of n - k.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, n is not equal to 1 and n is not equal to k; `a` is the factorial of n, `b` is the factorial of k, `c` is the factorial of n - k**
