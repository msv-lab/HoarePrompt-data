Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6. If n % i == 0, then `n` is updated to the result of integer division of n by i, `ans` contains a list of incremented values of `i`, `i` is continuously incremented by 1, and `cap` is the square root of `n` for the loop to execute again. If n % i != 0, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 10^6, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 2, and `cap` is the square root of `n` for the loop to execute again.***
