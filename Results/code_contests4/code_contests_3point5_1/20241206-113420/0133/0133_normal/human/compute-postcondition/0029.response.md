Postcondition: ***If n is not equal to 1, then ans is a list containing all the prime factors of n with the newly appended value, i is greater than cap, and cap is the square root of n for the loop to terminate. If n is equal to 1, then ans is an empty list, i is greater than cap, and cap is the square root of n after the loop finishes.***
