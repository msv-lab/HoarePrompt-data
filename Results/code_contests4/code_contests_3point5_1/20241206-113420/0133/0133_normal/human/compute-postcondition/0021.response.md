Example Answer:
`i` is incremented by 1, and then the value of `i` is appended to the list `ans`. The initial state indicates that `i` starts at 1, and `ans` is an empty list. As the loop continues, `i` will keep incrementing by 1 and getting added to the `ans` list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6, `ans` contains a list of incremented values of `i`, `i` is continuously incremented by 1, `cap` is the square root of `n` for the loop to execute again**.
