According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `cap`. If `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `cap` is the square root of `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `cap`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6, if `n` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is a list containing the factors of `n` that meet the condition, `i` is an integer, and `cap` is the square root of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is less than `cap`, `cap` is the square root of `n`, and `n` is not divisible by `i` for the loop to execute one more time**
