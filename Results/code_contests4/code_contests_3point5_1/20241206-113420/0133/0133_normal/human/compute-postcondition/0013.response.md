Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6. If `n` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is a list containing the factors of `n` that meet the condition, `i` is an integer, and `cap` is the square root of `n` for the loop to execute the first time. Otherwise, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `cap` is the square root of `n`, and `n` is not divisible by `i`.***
