Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `ans` will now contain all the prime factors of `n` including the newly appended value. The values of `i` and `cap` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing all the prime factors of n with the newly appended value, `i` is greater than cap, and `cap` is the square root of n for the loop to terminate.
Output State: **If n is greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing all the prime factors of n with the newly appended value, `i` is greater than cap, and `cap` is the square root of n for the loop to terminate.**
