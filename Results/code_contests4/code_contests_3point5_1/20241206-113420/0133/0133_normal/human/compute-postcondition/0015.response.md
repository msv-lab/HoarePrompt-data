Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is added to the list `ans` if it meets the condition in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6, if `n` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is a list containing the factors of `n` that meet the condition, `i` is an integer, `cap` is the square root of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is less than `cap`, `cap` is the square root of `n`, and `n` is not divisible by `i` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is appended to the list `ans`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6, if `n` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is a list containing the factors of `n` that meet the condition, `i` is an integer, `cap` is the square root of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is less than `cap`, `cap` is the square root of `n`, and `n` is not divisible by `i` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is appended to the list `ans`**
