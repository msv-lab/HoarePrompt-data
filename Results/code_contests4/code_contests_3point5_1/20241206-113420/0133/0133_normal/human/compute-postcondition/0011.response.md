The function `func_7` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The constraints for `n` are that it must be an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. 

After executing the function body, there are three possible return cases:

Case 1: The program always returns 1.
Case 2: The program returns 0.
Case 3: The program returns the value of `div` calculated based on the factorials of `n`, `k`, and `n - k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` satisfies the constraint 3 <= n <= 10^6, and then return 1, 0, or the calculated value of `div` based on the factorials of `n`, `k`, and `n - k`.
