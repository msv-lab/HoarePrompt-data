Example Answer:
The value of `cap` is updated to the square root of `n`. The previous values of `n`, `ans`, `i`, and `cap` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to the result of integer division of n by i, `ans` contains a list of incremented values of `i`, `i` is continuously incremented by 1, `cap` is the square root of `n` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` is updated to the result of integer division of n by i, `ans` contains a list of incremented values of `i`, `i` is continuously incremented by 1, `cap` is the square root of `n` for the loop to execute again**
