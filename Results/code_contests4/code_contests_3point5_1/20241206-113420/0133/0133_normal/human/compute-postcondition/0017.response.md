Example Answer:
`cap` is assigned the square root of `n`. The value of `n` is updated, so the new value of `cap` is the square root of the updated `n`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `cap` are not directly affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`n` is updated, `ans` may contain factors of `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cap` is assigned the square root of the updated `n`**
