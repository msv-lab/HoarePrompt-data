# Your task:

Given the problem description and the provided functions, we need to determine if the code correctly finds the number of cyclic permutations of length n modulo 10^9+7.

Let's analyze the code and see if it follows the problem description and output hints:

1. The `func_1` function simply reads an integer input and returns it. This aligns with the problem description as it expects an integer input `n` between 3 and 10^6.

2. The `func_2` function reads a space-separated list of integers and returns them as a list. This could be used to read the permutation array `p` as described in the problem.

3. The `func_3` function reads a string input and returns a list of characters excluding the last character. This might be used to process the input string.

4. The `func_4` function reads a space-separated list of integers and returns a map object containing those integers. This could also be used for reading the input.

5. The `func_5` function reads a string input, splits it based on spaces, and returns a list of substrings. This could be helpful for processing the input.

6. The `func_6` function calculates the prime factors of a given number `n`. This might be used for some calculations within the code.

7. The `func_7` function calculates the number of cyclic permutations based on the factorial calculations and some modulo operations. This is the main function that determines the output based on the input `n`.

Based on the code and the functions provided, there are no obvious cases where the code does not follow the problem description. The functions seem to handle the input processing and the calculation of cyclic permutations as required.

Therefore, after analyzing the code and the functions, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code seems to correctly calculate the number of cyclic permutations of length n modulo 10^9+7 as described in the problem.
