Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not directly address the problem description. It consists of functions that read input, split strings, find prime factors, and calculate factorials. None of these functions are related to finding the number of cyclic permutations of length n as described in the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the given problem. It needs to be revised to include functions that specifically address the problem requirements.
