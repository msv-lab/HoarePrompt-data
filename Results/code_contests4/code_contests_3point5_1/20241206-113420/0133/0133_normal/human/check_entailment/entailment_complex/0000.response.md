Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The functions provided in the code do not seem to directly address the specific requirements of finding the number of cyclic permutations of length n as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the annotations do not provide a clear indication of how the functions relate to the problem description.

Without a clear implementation of the logic to calculate the number of cyclic permutations as described in the problem statement, it is not possible to verify the correctness of the code. Therefore, the code is considered incorrect as it does not address the main problem statement.
