You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Consider a permutation p of length n, we build a graph of size n using it as follows: 

  * For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, find the largest j such that 1 ≤ j < i and p_j > p_i, and add an undirected edge between node i and node j 
  * For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, find the smallest j such that i < j ≤ n and p_j > p_i, and add an undirected edge between node i and node j 



In cases where no such j exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.

For clarity, consider as an example n = 4, and p = [3,1,4,2]; here, the edges of the graph are (1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3).

A permutation p is cyclic if the graph built using p has at least one simple cycle. 

Given n, find the number of cyclic permutations of length n. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

Please refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle

Input

The first and only line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

Output

Output a single integer 0 ≤ x < 10^9+7, the number of cyclic permutations of length n modulo 10^9+7.

Examples

Input

Output


16

Output

Note

There are 16 cyclic permutations for n = 4. [4,2,1,3] is one such permutation, having a cycle of length four: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 4.

Nodes v_1, v_2, …, v_k form a simple cycle if the following conditions hold: 

  * k ≥ 3. 
  * v_i ≠ v_j for any pair of indices i and j. (1 ≤ i < j ≤ k) 
  * v_i and v_{i+1} share an edge for all i (1 ≤ i < k), and v_1 and v_k share an edge. 
Program:
```
input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1():
    return int(input())

def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])

def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')

def func_6(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    ans = []
    i = 2
    cap = sqrt(n)
    while i <= cap:
        if n % i == 0:
            ans.append(i)
            n = n // i
            cap = sqrt(n)
        else:
            i += 1
    if n > 1:
        ans.append(n)
    return ans

def func_7(n, k):
    if n == 1 or n == k:
        return 1
    if k > n:
        return 0
    else:
        a = math.factorial(n)
        b = math.factorial(k)
        c = math.factorial(n - k)
        div = a // (b * c)
        return div
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = func_1()
ans = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    ans *= i
    ans %= mod
print(ans - 2 ** (n - 1)) % mod
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
