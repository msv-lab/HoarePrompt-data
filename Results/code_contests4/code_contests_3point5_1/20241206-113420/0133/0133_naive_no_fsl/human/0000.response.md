Correctness: **False**

The given program calculates the number of cyclic permutations incorrectly. The formula used to calculate the number of permutations is incorrect. The correct formula should involve calculating the number of derangements (permutations where no elements remain in their original position) and then using the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of cyclic permutations.

An example where the program fails to produce the correct result is when n = 4. The correct answer for n = 4 should be 9, however, the program outputs 14.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
