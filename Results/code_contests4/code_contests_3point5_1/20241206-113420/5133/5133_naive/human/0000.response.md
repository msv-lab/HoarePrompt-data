Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is supposed to find the largest value among A+B, A-B, and A*B. However, the program is incorrectly finding the maximum value from the list containing all three possible results without considering the constraints of the problem. 

For example, if A = 3 and B = 1, the correct output should be 4 (A+B), but the program will output "Max: 3" as it is just finding the maximum value from the list [4, 2, 3]. This shows that the program does not work as expected in all cases and hence the correctness is **False**.
