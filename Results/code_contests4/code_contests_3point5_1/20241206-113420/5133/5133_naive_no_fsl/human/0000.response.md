Correctness: False

The given program does not match the problem description. The program is taking two separate inputs for A and B, while the problem description states that the input should be provided in a single line separated by a space.

Example where the program does not work as expected:
Input
3
1

Expected Output
4

Actual Output
Max: 4

In this case, the program is taking separate inputs for A and B, so it is not handling the input format as described in the problem.
