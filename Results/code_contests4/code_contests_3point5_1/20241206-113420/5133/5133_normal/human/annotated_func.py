#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are no input variables for this function.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = a + b
    d = a - b
    e = a * b
    ary = [c, d, e]
    f = max(ary)
    print('Max:', f)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer inputs, calculates their sum, difference, and product, then finds the maximum value among them, and finally prints out the maximum value. The function does not return any value.
