Example Answer:
`ary` is assigned a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`, which are the sum, difference, and product of `a` and `b` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the result of `a - b`, `e` is the result of `a * b`, `ary` is a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the result of `a - b`, `e` is the result of `a * b`, `ary` is a list containing the values of `c`, `d`, and `e**
