Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `a + b`, where `a` and `b` are input integers. After execution, the value of `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`**
