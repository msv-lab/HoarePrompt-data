Example Answer:
`e` is assigned the value of `a * b`, where `a` and `b` are input integers. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the result of `a - b`, `e` is the result of `a * b`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the result of `a - b`, `e` is the result of `a * b`**
