Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since there are no input variables for this function, the program will prompt the user for an input when executed. Therefore, the output state is: a is an input integer.
Output State: **a is an input integer**
