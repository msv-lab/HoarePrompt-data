Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `a - b`, so `d` is the result of subtracting `b` from `a`. The values of `a` and `b` are input integers, and `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the result of `a - b`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`, `d` is the result of `a - b`**
