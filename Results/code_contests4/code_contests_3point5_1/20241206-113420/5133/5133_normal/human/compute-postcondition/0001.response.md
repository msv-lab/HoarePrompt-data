Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state mentions that `a` is an input integer, but it is not used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
