Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the function does not return any value, but the code calculates the maximum value and prints it out. This violates the problem description. Additionally, the code reads the input incorrectly by expecting two integers separated by a space, but it actually reads each integer on a separate line using `int(input())`. This means the code will not work as expected for the given input format.
