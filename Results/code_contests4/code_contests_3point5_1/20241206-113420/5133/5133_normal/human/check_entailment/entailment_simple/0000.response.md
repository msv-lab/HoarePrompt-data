Correctness: **True**

The program reads two integers A and B from standard input, calculates the sum, difference, and product of A and B, stores them in a list, finds the maximum value among them using the max() function, and then prints the maximum value. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program will always output the largest value among A+B, A-B, and A*B, as required.
