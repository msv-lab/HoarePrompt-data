Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly constructs a binary string s of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones, and exactly x indices i such that s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}. The program handles the case where x > 1 and a == 1 by starting with '1' if x is greater than 1 and a is 1. It then iterates through the remaining positions in the string, alternating between '0' and '1' to satisfy the condition of s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}. Finally, the program appends the remaining '0's and '1's to the string as needed. The output string s satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem description for every potential case.
