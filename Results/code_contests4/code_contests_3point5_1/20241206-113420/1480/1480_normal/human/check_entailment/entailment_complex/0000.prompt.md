You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given three integers a, b and x. Your task is to construct a binary string s of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones and exactly x indices i (where 1 ≤ i < n) such that s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

For example, for the string "01010" there are four indices i such that 1 ≤ i < n and s_i ≠ s_{i + 1} (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). For the string "111001" there are two such indices i (i = 3, 5).

Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers a, b and x (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ x < a + b).

Output

Print only one string s, where s is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

  * 001101; 
  * 010011; 
  * 001011. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b.**
def func():
    a, b, x = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    if (x > 1 and a == 1) :
        s = '1'
        b -= 1
    else :
        s = '0'
        a -= 1
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. If x > 1 and a == 1, then a is 1, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b - 1 ≤ 99, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, `s` is a string '1'. If x ≤ 1 or a ≠ 1, then a is decreased by 1, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, `s` is assigned the string '0'.
    while x > 1:
        if s[-1] == '0':
            s += '1'
            b -= 1
        else:
            s += '0'
            a -= 1
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer, `s` is a string. If the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s`, `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `x` is 1. If the last character of `s` is '0', `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `x` is 1
    if (s[-1] == '0') :
        s += '1' * b
        s += '0' * a
    else :
        s += '0' * a
        s += '1' * b
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer, `s` is a string. If the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s`, `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `x` is 1. If the last character of `s` is '0', `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `x` is 1. If the last character of `s` is '0', `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `x` is 1. If the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s`, `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `x` is 1
    print(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three integers a, b, and x from input, and based on certain conditions, it constructs a string `s`. The function then prints the final string `s` based on the conditions. If x is greater than 1 and a is 1, then '1' is appended to `s` and b is decremented. If x is less than or equal to 1 or a is not 1, '0' is appended to `s` and a is decremented. The loop continues to append alternately '1' and '0' to `s` based on specific conditions until x becomes 1. After the loop, '1' and '0' are appended to `s` based on the last character of `s` to form the final string. The function prints the constructed string `s`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
