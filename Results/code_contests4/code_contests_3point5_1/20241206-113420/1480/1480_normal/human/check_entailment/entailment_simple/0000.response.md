Correctness: **True**

The program correctly constructs a binary string `s` of length `n = a + b` such that there are exactly `a` zeroes, exactly `b` ones, and exactly `x` indices `i` such that `s_i â‰  s_{i + 1}`. The program first constructs the string based on the value of `x` and appends alternating characters to satisfy the condition. Finally, it appends the remaining characters based on whether the last character in `s` is '0' or '1'.

The program handles all possible cases and ensures that the constructed string satisfies the given conditions.
