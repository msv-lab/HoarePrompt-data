Correctness: **True**

The program reads three integers a, b, and x and constructs a binary string s of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones, and exactly x indices i such that s_i â‰  s_{i + 1}. The program first appends '1' to s if x > 1 and a == 1, otherwise it appends '0' to s and decrements a or b accordingly. Then, it enters a loop where it alternately appends '1' and '0' to s until x becomes 1. Finally, it appends '1' or '0' to s based on the last character of s to form the final string.

The program follows the problem description accurately and ensures that the constructed binary string meets all the specified conditions.
