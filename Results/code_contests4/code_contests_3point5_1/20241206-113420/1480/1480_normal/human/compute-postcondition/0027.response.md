Example Answer:
The last character of `s` is '1', so '0' is appended to `s`. `a` is decremented by 2, `b` is decreased by 1, `x` is decreased by 2. After execution, `s` will have '10', `a` will be decreased by 2, `b` will be decreased by 1, and `x` will be decreased by 2.
Output State: **`s` is '10', `a` is decreased by 2, `b` is decreased by 1, `x` is decreased by 2**
