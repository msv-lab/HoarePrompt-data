Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100. If the last character of `s` is '0', `b` is decreased by 1. If the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s` and `a` is decremented by 1; `x` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100. If the last character of `s` is '0', `b` is decreased by 1. If the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s` and `a` is decremented by 1; `x` is decreased by 1**
