Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers a, b, and x from input, and based on certain conditions, it constructs a string `s`. The function then prints the final string `s` based on the conditions. If x is greater than 1 and a is 1, then '1' is appended to `s` and b is decremented. If x is less than or equal to 1 or a is not 1, '0' is appended to `s` and a is decremented. The loop continues to append alternately '1' and '0' to `s` based on specific conditions until x becomes 1. After the loop, '1' and '0' are appended to `s` based on the last character of `s` to form the final string. The function prints the constructed string `s`.**
