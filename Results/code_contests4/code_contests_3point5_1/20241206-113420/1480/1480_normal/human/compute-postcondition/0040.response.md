The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function `func` returns the sum of the integers `a` and `b` if `x` is less than the sum of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return the sum of the integers `a` and `b` only if `x` is less than the sum of `a` and `b`.
