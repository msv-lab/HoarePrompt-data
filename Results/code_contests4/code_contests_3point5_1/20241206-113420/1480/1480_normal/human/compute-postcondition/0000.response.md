Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are constrained by the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b**
