Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the string value '1'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain the same as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b. x is greater than 1 and a is equal to 1; `s` is a string '1'.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b. x is greater than 1 and a is equal to 1; `s` is a string '1'**
