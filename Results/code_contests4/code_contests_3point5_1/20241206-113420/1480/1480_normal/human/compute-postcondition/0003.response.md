Example Answer:
The value of `b` is decremented by 1, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `b` will be in the range 1 ≤ b - 1 ≤ 99. The values of `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`a` is 1, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b - 1 ≤ 99, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, `s` is a string '1'**
