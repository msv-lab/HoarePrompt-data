Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer, `s` is a string. If the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s`, `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `x` is 1. If the last character of `s` is '0', `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `x` is 1. If the last character of `s` is '0', `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x` minus 1, `x` is 1. If the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s`, `a` is decremented by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `b` is decreased by a total number of times equal to the original value of `x`, `x` is 1***
