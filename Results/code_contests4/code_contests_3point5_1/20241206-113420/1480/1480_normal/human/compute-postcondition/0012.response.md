Postcondition: ***a, b, x are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. If x > 1 and a == 1, then a is 1, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b - 1 ≤ 99, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, s is a string '1'. If x ≤ 1 or a ≠ 1, then a is decreased by 1, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, s is assigned the string '0'. Additionally, the condition (s[-1] == '0') is false.***
