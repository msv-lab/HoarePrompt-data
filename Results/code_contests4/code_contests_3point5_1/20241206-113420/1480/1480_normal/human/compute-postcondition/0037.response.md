Example Answer:
The string `s` has '0' appended `a` times, and then '1' is appended `b` times. The values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer, `s` is a string with '0' appended `a` times, and '1' appended `b` times.
Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer, `s` is a string with '0' appended `a` times, and '1' appended `b` times**
