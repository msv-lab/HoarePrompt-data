Output State: **a, b, x are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ x < a + b. If s[-1] == '0', a is decreased by 1, b is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 99, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, s is a string '01'. If s[-1] != '0', a is decreased by 1, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < a + b, s is assigned the string '00'.**
