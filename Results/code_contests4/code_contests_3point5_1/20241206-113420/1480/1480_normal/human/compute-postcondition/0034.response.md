Example Answer:
The code appends '0' repeated `a` times to the string `s`. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, the string `s` will have '0' repeated `a` times followed by '1' repeated `b` times. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer, `s` is a string ending with '0' repeated `a+b` times followed by '1' repeated `b` times.
Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, `b` is an integer, `s` is a string ending with '0' repeated `a+b` times followed by '1' repeated `b` times**
