Example Answer:
The code snippet appends '1' to the string `s`. The value of `s` is unknown initially. After appending '1', if the last character of `s` is '1', '0' is appended to `s`. `a` is decremented by 2, `b` is decreased by 1, and `x` is decreased by 2. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (decremented by 2), `b` is decreased by 1, `x` is decreased by 2.
Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (decremented by 2), `b` is decreased by 1, `x` is decreased by 2**
