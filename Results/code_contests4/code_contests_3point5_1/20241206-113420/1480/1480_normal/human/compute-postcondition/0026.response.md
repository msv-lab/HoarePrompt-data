Example Answer:
The value of `b` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `b` is already decreased by 1, so after execution, `b` will be decreased by a total of 2. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (decremented by 2), `b` is decreased by 2, `x` is decreased by 2.
Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (decremented by 2), `b` is decreased by 2, `x` is decreased by 2**
