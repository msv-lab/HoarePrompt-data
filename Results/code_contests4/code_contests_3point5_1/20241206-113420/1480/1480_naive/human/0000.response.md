Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly constructs a binary string 's' of length n = a + b where there are exactly a zeros, exactly b ones, and exactly x indices i such that s_i â‰  s_{i + 1}. 
The program first checks if x is greater than 1 and a is equal to 1, then it initializes s with '1' and decrements b by 1. Otherwise, it initializes s with '0' and decrements a by 1. 
Then, it enters a loop where it alternates between appending '1' and '0' based on the last character of s until x becomes 1.
Finally, it appends the remaining '1's and '0's based on the last character of s to satisfy the conditions.
The program prints the constructed binary string 's' which satisfies all the given conditions. 
For all possible inputs within the provided constraints, the program correctly constructs the required binary string.
