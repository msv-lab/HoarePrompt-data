Example Answer:
The code snippet tries to print the result of adding 4 to the input value (which is a string) and then dividing the result by 5. Since the input value is not stored in any variable, we can't perform the addition operation. Therefore, the code will raise an error before reaching the division operation.
Output State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'**
