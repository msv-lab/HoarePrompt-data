#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 1,000,000.**
def func():
    print(input() + 4) / 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It attempts to print the result of adding 4 to the user input and dividing the sum by 5. However, there is a syntax error in the code as the print statement is not correctly formatted. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to attempt an invalid operation due to the syntax error in the print statement.
