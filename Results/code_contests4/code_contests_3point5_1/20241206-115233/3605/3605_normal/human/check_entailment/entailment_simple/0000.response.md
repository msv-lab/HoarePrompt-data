Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program simply takes an input, adds 4 to it, and then divides the result by 5. This does not calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to the friend's house as specified in the problem description.

The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of steps needed for the elephant to reach the friend's house by moving 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions forward in each step. The provided program does not implement this logic.
