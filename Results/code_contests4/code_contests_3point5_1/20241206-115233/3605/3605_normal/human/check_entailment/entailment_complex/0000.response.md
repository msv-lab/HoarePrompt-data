Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x as described in the problem description. The program simply adds 4 to the user input and then divides the sum by 5, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem. Additionally, there is a syntax error in the print statement as it is not correctly formatted.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct functionality.
