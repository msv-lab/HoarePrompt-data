Correctness: **False**

The given code does not accurately solve the problem described. The code simply adds 4 to the user input and divides the sum by 5, which does not represent the minimum number of steps an elephant needs to take to reach his friend's house. The code lacks the logic to calculate the minimum number of steps required based on the given constraints. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description.
