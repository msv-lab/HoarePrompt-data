Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x. The formula `print(input() + 4) / 5` is incorrect as it simply adds 4 to the input and then divides by 5, which does not accurately represent the minimum number of steps required. 

For example, if the input is 12, the expected output should be 3 (move by 3, 5, and 4), but the program would output 3.2 which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
