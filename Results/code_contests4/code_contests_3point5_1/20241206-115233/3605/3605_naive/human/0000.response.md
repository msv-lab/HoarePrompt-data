Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get to his friend's house. The program simply takes the input, adds 4 to it, and then divides the result by 5. This logic does not follow the problem description.

For example, if the input is 12, the correct output should be 3 (3 + 5 + 4 = 12). However, the given program would output 3.2, which is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the expected output for all potential cases.
