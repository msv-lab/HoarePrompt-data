Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves Anatoly needs to perform in order to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate. It considers two cases: one where the odd index cockroaches are misplaced and another where the even index cockroaches are misplaced. It calculates the number of swaps needed in each case and returns the minimum of the two. The logic seems to be correct and covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The program also handles the case where the colors of cockroaches in the line are already alternating.
