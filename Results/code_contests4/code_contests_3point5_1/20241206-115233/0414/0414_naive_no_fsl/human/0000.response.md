Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by calculating the minimum number of turns needed to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate. It considers swapping cockroaches or changing their colors as operations to achieve the desired result. The function `func_1` calculates the number of misplaced cockroaches for odd and even positions, then determines the minimum number of swaps and color changes needed to achieve the alternating pattern. The overall result is the minimum of the two cases (swapping 'r' and 'b' or 'b' and 'r'). The code handles the given input and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
