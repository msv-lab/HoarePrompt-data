#State of the program right berfore the function call: sequence is a string of length n where n is a positive integer. oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches ('b' for black and 'r' for red).**
def func_1(sequence, oddchar, evenchar):
    length = len(sequence)
    oddmisplaced = 0
    evenmisplaced = 0
    for i in range(length):
        if i % 2 == 0 and sequence[i] != evenchar:
            evenmisplaced = evenmisplaced + 1
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and sequence[i] != oddchar:
            oddmisplaced = oddmisplaced + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: sequence is a string of length n where n is a positive odd integer, oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches, length is a positive integer, oddmisplaced is the number of odd indices in the sequence where the cockroach color is incorrect, evenmisplaced is the number of even indices in the sequence where the cockroach color is incorrect
    swaps = min(evenmisplaced, oddmisplaced)
    color = abs(evenmisplaced - oddmisplaced)
    return swaps + color
    #The program returns the sum of 'swaps' and 'color', where 'swaps' is the minimum value between the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices, and 'color' is the absolute difference between the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a string sequence representing cockroach colors, along with two characters oddchar and evenchar. It then calculates the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices and returns the sum of the minimum value between the misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices (swaps) and the absolute difference between the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices (color).
