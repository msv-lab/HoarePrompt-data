Postcondition: ***sequence is a string of length n where n is a positive odd integer, oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches, length is a positive integer, oddmisplaced is 2, evenmisplaced is 3, i is an even integer incremented by 2, for the loop to execute again, i must be less than length. If i is an even number and the character at index i in the sequence is not equal to evenchar, then evenmisplaced is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
