The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `sequence`, `oddchar`, and `evenchar`. `sequence` is a string of length n where n is a positive integer. `oddchar` and `evenchar` are characters representing the colors of cockroaches ('b' for black and 'r' for red). After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of 'swaps' and 'color', where 'swaps' is the minimum value between the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices, and 'color' is the absolute difference between the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `sequence` representing the colors of cockroaches, along with two characters `oddchar` and `evenchar` representing the colors of the cockroaches, and then calculate and return the sum of 'swaps' and 'color' based on the rules specified. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a string sequence of cockroach colors, along with two characters oddchar and evenchar. It calculates and returns the sum of 'swaps' and 'color' based on the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices.**
