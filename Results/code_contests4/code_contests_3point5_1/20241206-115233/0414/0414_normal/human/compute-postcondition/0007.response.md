Postcondition: ***sequence is a string of length n where n is a positive odd integer. oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches ('b' for black and 'r' for red), length is a positive integer, oddmisplaced is 0, evenmisplaced is 1, i is an even integer. If the character at index i in the sequence is not equal to evenchar, then evenmisplaced is incremented by 1. Additionally, i % 2 is 1 and sequence[i] is not equal to oddchar.***
