Postcondition: ***sequence is a string of length n where n is a positive odd integer, oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches, length is a positive integer, oddmisplaced is 3, evenmisplaced is 4, i is an even integer incremented by 4, for the loop to execute again, i must be less than length. If i is even and the character at index i in the sequence is not equal to evenchar, then there is a cockroach of the wrong color at the even index i in the sequence. If i is odd and the character at index i in the sequence is not equal to oddchar, then there is a cockroach of the wrong color at the odd index i in the sequence.***
