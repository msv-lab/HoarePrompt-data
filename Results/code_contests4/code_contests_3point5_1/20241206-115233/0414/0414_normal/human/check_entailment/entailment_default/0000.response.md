Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input of the number of cockroaches and their colors, then calculates the minimum number of moves needed to make the colors alternate in the line.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices and then returns the sum of the minimum value between the misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices and the absolute difference between them.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
- The output hints also agree with the code and describe the functionality accurately.
- After carefully reviewing the code and the problem description, it can be concluded that the code is correct and meets all the requirements.
