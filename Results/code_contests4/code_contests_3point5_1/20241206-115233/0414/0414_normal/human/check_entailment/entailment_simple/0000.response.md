Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of turns Anatoly needs to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate. It does this by counting the number of misplaced cockroaches at even and odd indices separately, then taking the minimum of these counts as the number of swaps needed. Additionally, it considers the absolute difference between the counts to account for cases where there are more misplaced cockroaches at one type of index than the other.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
