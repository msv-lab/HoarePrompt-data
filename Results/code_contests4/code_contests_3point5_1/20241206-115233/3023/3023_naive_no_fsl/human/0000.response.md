Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input which consists of the number of balls and their coordinates.
2. The program then calculates the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by choosing optimal p and q values.
3. The program iterates through all possible pairs of balls and calculates the score based on the given conditions.
4. It considers all the edge cases such as when the cost of the operation is 0, when the ball is collected for the first time, and when the ball is collected in subsequent operations.
5. The program returns the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls.
6. The logic of the program seems sound and follows the problem description accurately.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and handles all the potential cases described in the problem statement.
