Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem description. It calculates the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by choosing two integers p and q optimally. The program iterates through all possible pairs of balls, calculates the cost of collecting all balls with those p and q values, and updates the minimum cost accordingly. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description and provides the correct output for all the given examples. Additionally, there are no obvious logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to consider. Hence, the program is correct.
