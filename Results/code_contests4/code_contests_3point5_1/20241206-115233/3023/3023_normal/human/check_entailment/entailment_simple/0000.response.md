Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It finds the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by choosing the optimal values of p and q. The program follows the required steps of choosing different combinations of p and q, calculating the cost for each combination, and returning the minimum cost. The functions are appropriately defined to handle the calculations and iterations required to find the optimal solution. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description, making it correct.
