Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code is missing the implementation of the `solve` function which is mentioned in the annotations but not provided in the code. This is crucial for calculating the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls, as the `solve` function is expected to provide the correct solution.
- The `score` function provided in the code does not seem to be correctly implemented based on the problem description. The calculations in the `score` function do not align with the described cost calculation for collecting the balls.
- The functions `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, and `func_8` do not directly contribute to solving the problem as they are related to testing and input/output handling.
- Without the correct implementation of the `solve` function and the proper logic in the `score` function, the code does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
