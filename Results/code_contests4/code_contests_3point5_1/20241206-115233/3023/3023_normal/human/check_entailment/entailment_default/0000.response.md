Correctness: **False**

Explanation: After analyzing the provided code and the problem description, as well as reviewing the output hints, I have identified a potential case where the code does not work as expected. The function `func_2` calculates the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by considering unique combinations of differences between the coordinates of the balls. However, the code does not seem to handle the case where the coordinates of the balls are such that the optimal choice of `p` and `q` does not result in a cost of 0 or 1.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
In this case, the optimal choice for `p` and `q` would be (1,1) to collect all balls with a cost of 0. However, the code does not seem to account for this scenario and may not give the correct output.

Therefore, based on this potential case where the code may not work as expected, the correctness of the code is determined to be **False**.
