Example Answer: 
Variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default ' ', `file` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default ' ', `file` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True**
