Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with keys as all unique values of `x` from `balls` and values as sets containing all unique values of `y` corresponding to each `x` in `balls`; `tried` is a set containing all unique tuples `(p, q)` where `(p, q)` is added as well as `(-p, -q)` for all unique combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `ans` is the minimum score obtained from all combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `i` is the new index for the next iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and satisfies the loop condition, `j` is updated to `i-1`, `p` and `q` are the differences between the last elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]` respectively for the last iteration, `points` is the new score obtained from the last combination of differences.**
