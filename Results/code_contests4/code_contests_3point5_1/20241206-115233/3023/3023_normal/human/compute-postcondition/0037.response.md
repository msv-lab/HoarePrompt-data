Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with keys as all unique values of `x` from balls and values as sets containing all unique values of `y` corresponding to each `x` in balls; `tried` is a set containing the tuples `(p, q)` where `(p, q)` is added as well as `(-p, -q)` for all unique combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `ans` is the minimum score obtained from all combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `i` is the last index of the loop execution, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `i-1` at the end of the loop execution, `p` and `q` are the differences between the last elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]` respectively; `points` is the score obtained from the last combination of differences.**
