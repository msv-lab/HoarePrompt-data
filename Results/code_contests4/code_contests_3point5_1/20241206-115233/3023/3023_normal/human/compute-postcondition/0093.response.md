Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with keys as all unique values of `x` from `balls` and values as sets containing all unique values of `y` corresponding to each `x` in `balls`; `tried` is a set containing all unique tuples `(p, q)` where `(p, q)` is added as well as `(-p, -q)` for all unique combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `ans` is the minimum score obtained from all combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `i` is increased by 1 to move to the next index for the next iteration; `j` is updated to `i-1` for the next iteration; `p` and `q` are updated with the differences between the last elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]` for the next iteration; `points` should be updated with the new score obtained from the next combination of differences, for the loop to execute, `i` is greater than 0. If the tuple `(p, q)` is not in `tried`, it is added to `tried`. `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. If `points` is less than `ans`, the state of the program remains the same with the updated values of `bdict`, `tried`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `p`, `q`, and `points`.**
