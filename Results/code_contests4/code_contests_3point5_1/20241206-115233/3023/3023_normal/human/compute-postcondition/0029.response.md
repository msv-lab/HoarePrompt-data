According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with keys as all unique values of `x` from balls and values as sets containing all unique values of `y` corresponding to each `x` in balls; `tried` is a set containing the tuple `(p, q)` where `(p, q)` is added as well as `(-p, -q)`; `ans` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time, `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`; after the if condition, `tried` has the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` added, `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`; `ans` is updated to the value of `points` if `points` is less than the initial value of `ans`.**
