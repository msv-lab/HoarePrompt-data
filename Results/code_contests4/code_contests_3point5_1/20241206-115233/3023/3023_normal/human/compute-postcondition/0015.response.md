Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the `file`, and the string representation of the third element in `args` (which is `x`) is also written to the `file`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` retain their previous values, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, `sep` is written to the `file` along with the string representation of the third element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` retain their previous values, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `args`, `sep` is written to the `file` along with the string representation of the third element in `args`**
