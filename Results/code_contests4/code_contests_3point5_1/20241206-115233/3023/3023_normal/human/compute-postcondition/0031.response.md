Output State: **`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with keys as all unique values of `x` from balls and values as sets containing all unique values of `y` corresponding to each `x` in balls; `tried` is a set containing the tuple `(p, q)` where `(p, q)` is added as well as `(-p, -q)`; `ans` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time, `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`; after the if condition, `tried` has the tuples `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)` added, `points` is the result of the function `score(p, q)`; `ans` is updated to the value of `points` if `points` is less than the initial value of `ans`; `p` and `q` are assigned the calculated values `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]` and `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]` respectively, `(p, q)` is added to `tried`.**
