Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `balls`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the `balls` list, and `balls` is a list of tuples. The function calculates the minimum score obtained from all unique combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`. The program utilizes a defaultdict to store the values of `y` based on unique `x` values in `balls`, then iterates over all combinations of elements in `balls` to find the minimum score. The function then returns this minimum score. However, the annotations mention a call to a `score` function which is missing in the provided code, so this missing functionality should be noted.**
