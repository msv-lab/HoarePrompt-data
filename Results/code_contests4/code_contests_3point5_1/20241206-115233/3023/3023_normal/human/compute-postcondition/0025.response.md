Functionality: **The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters and iterates over elements in `args`, writing them to a stream. It uses the `sep` value to separate elements and writes the last element with `end` specified in `kwargs`. If the `flush` key in `kwargs` is True, it flushes the stream. If `args` is empty, the function will not write anything.**
