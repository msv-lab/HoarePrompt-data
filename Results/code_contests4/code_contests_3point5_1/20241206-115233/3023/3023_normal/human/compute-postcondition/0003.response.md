According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` variable. If `args` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default ' ', `file` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is True. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `args` must have at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `args`.
State: **`sep` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default ' ', `file` is assigned the value from `kwargs` or default `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`**
