Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `points`, which is returned from the `score` function with the input values -p, -q. The value of `ans` will be the same as `points`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tried` now contains the newly added tuple (-p, -q), `ans` is equal to the value returned from the `score` function with input values -p, -q.
Output State: **`tried` now contains the newly added tuple (-p, -q), `ans` is equal to the value returned from the `score` function with input values -p, -q**
