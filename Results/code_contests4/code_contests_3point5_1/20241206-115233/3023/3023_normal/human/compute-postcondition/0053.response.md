Example Answer:
The function score(p, q) is called with the values -p and -q. Based on the implementation of the score function, it will return a value that will be assigned to the variable points. The values of p and q are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we can't calculate the specific value of points.
Output State: **`tried` now contains the newly added tuple (-p, -q), points is returned from the score function with the input values -p, -q**
