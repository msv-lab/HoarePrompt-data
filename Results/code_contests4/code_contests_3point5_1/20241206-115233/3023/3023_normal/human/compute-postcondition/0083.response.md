Postcondition: ***`bdict` is a defaultdict of sets with keys as all unique values of `x` from `balls` and values as sets containing all unique values of `y` corresponding to each `x` in `balls`; `tried` is a set containing all unique tuples `(p, q)` where `(p, q)` is added as well as `(-p, -q)` for all unique combinations of differences between elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `ans` is updated with the value of `points`; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is updated to `i-1`; `p` and `q` are updated with the differences between the last elements of `balls[j]` and `balls[i]`; `tried` is updated by adding `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`; `points` is updated with the new score obtained from the next combination of differences.***
