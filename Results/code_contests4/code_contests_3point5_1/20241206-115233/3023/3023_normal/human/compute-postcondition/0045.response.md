Postcondition: ***bdict is a defaultdict of sets with keys as all unique values of x from balls and values as sets containing all unique values of y corresponding to each x in balls; tried is a set containing the tuples (p, q) where (p, q) is added as well as (-p, -q) for all unique combinations of differences between elements of balls[j] and balls[i]; ans is the minimum score obtained from all combinations of differences between elements of balls[j] and balls[i]; i is the new index for the next iteration, n is greater than 0 and satisfies the loop condition, j is updated to i-1, p is the difference between the first elements of balls[j] and balls[i], q is the difference between the second elements of balls[j] and balls[i], points is the new score obtained from the next combination of differences, for the loop to execute the first time i is greater than 0. Additionally, (p, q) is not in tried, (p, q) is added to the set `tried`. `points` is assigned the return value of the function `score` with arguments `p` and `q`. The condition (points < ans) is true***
