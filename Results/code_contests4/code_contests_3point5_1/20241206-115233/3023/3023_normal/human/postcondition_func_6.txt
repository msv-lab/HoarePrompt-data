The function `func_6` takes three parameters: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `judge`. It iterates through the values generated by `inputs_gen`, calls the `solution` function with the arguments, deep copies the arguments and the result, then compares the result with the original arguments using the `judge` function. If the comparison is false, it increments the `wrong` counter and calls `func_8` with an error message. After the loop, it prints a message indicating the number of tests passed or failed based on the `wrong` counter. The functionality of the function is to test the correctness of the `solution` function based on the provided test cases generated by `inputs_gen` and evaluated by the `judge` function.
