The function func_5 accepts two parameters: `solution` which represents the correct solution function, and `inputs_answers` which contains input-output pairs. It iterates through each pair, calls the `solution` function with the input arguments, compares the output with the expected answer, and increments the `wrong` counter if they do not match. At the end, it prints the number of correct and incorrect tests. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the test results.
