Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero element in the input array as described in the problem description. It first identifies the indices of all zero elements and then iteratively calculates the distance to each element by traversing through the array. The final output is the sequence of distances which is printed as required.

The program handles all cases where there is at least one zero element in the array, and it correctly calculates the distances to the nearest zero for each element. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the given problem description.
