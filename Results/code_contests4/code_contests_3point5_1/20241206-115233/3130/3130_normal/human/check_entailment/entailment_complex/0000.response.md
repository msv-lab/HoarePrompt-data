Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer n and an array of n integers from input, finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element, and outputs the distances as a space-separated string. The program uses a queue to keep track of the indices and distances, ensuring that it calculates the correct distances for each element. The program handles the case where there is at least one element equal to zero in the array, as specified in the problem description.
