Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads an integer n from input and an array a of n integers from standard input.
- It then finds the shortest distances from the index containing 0 in the array a to all other indices.
- The function outputs these distances as a space-separated string.
- The code uses a deque data structure to efficiently track the indices to be processed next.
- The loop continues until all valid indices have been processed and the distances have been updated correctly.
- The code accounts for moving both left and right from the current index to find the nearest zero element.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct for the given problem description.
