Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` to the list `que`. The values of `ix` and `lev` are not defined in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it**
