Example Answer:
After executing the code, a tuple containing the values of `i` and 0 is appended to the deque object `que`. Since `i` is 1 initially, and the tuple is (i, 0), the deque `que` now contains two tuples: (i, 0) and (1, 0).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0) and (1, 0), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1**
