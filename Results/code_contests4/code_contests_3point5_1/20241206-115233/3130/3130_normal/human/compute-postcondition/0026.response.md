Example Answer:
`lev` is assigned to `out[ix]`, where `lev` is the value assigned to the variable `out[ix]`. The value of `ix` is not specified but since `out` has -1 values with length n, `lev` is assigned to the corresponding index `ix` in the list `out`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it**
