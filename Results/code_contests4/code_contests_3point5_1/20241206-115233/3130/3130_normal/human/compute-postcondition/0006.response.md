According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with one element of tuple (i, 0), `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with one element of tuple (i, 0), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1**
