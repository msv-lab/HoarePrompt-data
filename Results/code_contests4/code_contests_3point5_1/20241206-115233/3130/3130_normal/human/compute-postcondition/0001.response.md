Example Answer:
The list `out` is assigned a list of -1 values with the same length as `n`, which is a positive integer. The `que` variable is assigned an empty deque object. The initial state of `a` containing n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is an empty deque object**
