Example Answer:
The value at index `ix` of list `out` is assigned the value of `lev`. The value of `lev` is not given in the initial state, so the output state is: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it. The value of `out` at index `ix` is not equal to -1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it. The value of `out` at index `ix` is not equal to -1**
