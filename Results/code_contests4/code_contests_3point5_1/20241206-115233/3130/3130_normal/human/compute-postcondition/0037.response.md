Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple containing `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` to the list `que`. This will add another element to the queue. The previous values of `ix` and `lev` are used to calculate the new values. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1) and `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to `que`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1) and (ix - 1, lev + 1) is appended to `que`**
