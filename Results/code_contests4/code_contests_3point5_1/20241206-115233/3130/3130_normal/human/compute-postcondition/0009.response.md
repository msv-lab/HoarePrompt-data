According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0) and (1, 0), `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0) and (1, 0), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1**
