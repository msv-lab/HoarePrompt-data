According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `que` list is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions provided are as follows:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero
- `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`
- `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1) if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `que` should not be empty. This means that the condition for adding elements to `que` based on (ix - 1, lev + 1) should be satisfied at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, and `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1) if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
