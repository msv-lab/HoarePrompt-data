Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0) and (1, 0), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1. If the condition not a[i] is true, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.***
