Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, and `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1) and (ix - 1, lev + 1) if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1 for the loop to execute one more time. After the if else block executes, the value of `out[ix]` is updated to `lev` if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1.***
