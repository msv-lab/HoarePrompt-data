Example Answer:
The `que` deque appends the tuple `(i, 0)`, where `i` is 2. After appending, the `que` deque will have elements (i, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1**
