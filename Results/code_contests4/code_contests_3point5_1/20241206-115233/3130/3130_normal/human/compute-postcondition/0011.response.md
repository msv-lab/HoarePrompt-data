Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1. If `a[i]` is False (equal to zero), the program state remains unchanged.***
