Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which takes an integer input. The list `a` is assigned the values of `n` elements from the input separated by spaces. At least one element in the list `a` is zero. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero**
