Example Answer:
`ix` and `lev` are assigned the values of the first element in the `que` list. The previous values of `ix` and `lev` are unknown, but `que` is guaranteed to have at least one more element. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, and `que` has at least one more element added to it.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, and `que` has at least one more element added to it**
