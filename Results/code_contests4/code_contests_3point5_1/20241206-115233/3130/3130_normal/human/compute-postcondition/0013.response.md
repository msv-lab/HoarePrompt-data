According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `que` is not empty. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0) for all i where `a[i]` is equal to 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `que` deque object needs to have at least one more element added to it, as it is the condition for the loop continuation.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is a deque object with elements (i, 0) for all i where `a[i]` is equal to 0, and `que` has at least one more element added to it**
