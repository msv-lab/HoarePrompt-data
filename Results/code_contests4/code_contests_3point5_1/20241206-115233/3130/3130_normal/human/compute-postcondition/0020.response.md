Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it, the value of `out` at index `ix` is not equal to -1. If 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, then `que` appends a tuple containing (ix + 1, lev + 1). Additionally, if (0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1), then `que` appends a tuple containing (ix - 1, lev + 1)***
