Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1) and (ix - 1, lev + 1) is appended to `que`. Additionally, the value of `out[ix]` is updated to `lev` if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1.***
