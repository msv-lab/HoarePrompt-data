Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple containing (ix - 1, lev + 1) to the que list. The values of ix and lev are not explicitly given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values after this operation. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it, the value of `out` at index `ix` is not equal to -1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` has at least one more element added to it, the value of `out` at index `ix` is not equal to -1.**
