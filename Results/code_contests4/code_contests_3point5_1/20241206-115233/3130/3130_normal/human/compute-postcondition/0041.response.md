Example Answer:
The code snippet prints out the elements in the list `out` separated by a space after converting them to strings. The list `out` contains the shortest distances from the index containing 0. The variables `n`, `a`, and `que` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of the shortest distances from the index containing 0, and `que` is empty after all iterations have executed.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of the shortest distances from the index containing 0, and `que` is empty after all iterations have executed.**
