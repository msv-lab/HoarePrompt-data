Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1) to the list `que`. This will increase the size of `que` by one element. The previous values of `ix` and `lev` are not provided, so the specific values of the tuple cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix + 1, lev + 1)**
