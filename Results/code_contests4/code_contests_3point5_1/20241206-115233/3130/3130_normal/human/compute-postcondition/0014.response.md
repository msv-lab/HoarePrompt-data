Example Answer:
`ix, lev` are assigned the values from the leftmost element of the `que` deque. The `que` deque is guaranteed to have at least one element, so `ix` and `lev` will be assigned valid values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, and `que` has at least one more element added to it.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, and `que` has at least one more element added to it**
