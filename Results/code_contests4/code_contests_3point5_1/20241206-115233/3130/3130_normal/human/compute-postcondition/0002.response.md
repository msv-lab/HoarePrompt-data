According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Additionally, the loop will execute n times, so the initial states that need to be adjusted are `i` is 0, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, and `que` is an empty deque object.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length n, `que` is an empty deque object, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
