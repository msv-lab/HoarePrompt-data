Example Answer:
The value of `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`. `ix` and `lev` are derived from the tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1) in the `que` list. Since at least one element in `a` is equal to zero, the loop will execute at least one more time, leading to the addition of a new tuple in `que`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1), and the value of `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains `n` integer elements with at least one element equal to zero, `out` is a list of -1 values with length `n`, `que` has at least one more element added to it with the tuple (ix - 1, lev + 1), and the value of `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`**
