Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array. It uses a deque to perform a breadth-first search starting from the position of each zero element. The program then updates the distance values for each non-zero element based on the closest zero element found during the search. The program covers all potential cases and correctly outputs the distances as required by the problem description.
