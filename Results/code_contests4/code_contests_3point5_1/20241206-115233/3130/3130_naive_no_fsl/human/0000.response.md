Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array.
- It uses a deque to efficiently traverse through the array and update the distances.
- It handles the case where there is at least one zero element in the given array.
- The logic of updating the distances based on the current index and level is correctly implemented.
- The output is printed as required, showing the sequence of distances to the nearest zero.
