Correctness: **False**

The provided code is incomplete as the function `func_1` does not contain any implementation logic and simply passes control without any computation or return value. The problem description requires the function to perform a specific task of sorting n arrays simultaneously based on certain conditions, but the code does not address this requirement. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for any potential case and is considered incorrect.
