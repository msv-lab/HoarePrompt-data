Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the greatest beautiful divisor of a given number n. It iterates through possible beautiful numbers in binary representation (starting from '110' and increasing by appending '1' at the start and '0' at the end), and checks if the number n is divisible by the corresponding decimal value of the binary number. The program updates the greatest beautiful divisor found so far and prints it at the end. 

The program handles all potential cases where a beautiful number can be a divisor of n. It works correctly for all inputs within the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The logic implemented aligns with the problem description, making the program correct.
