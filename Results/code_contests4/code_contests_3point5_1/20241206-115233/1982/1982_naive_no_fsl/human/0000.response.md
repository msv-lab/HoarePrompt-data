Correctness: True

Explanation: The program iterates through possible beautiful numbers in binary representation starting from '110' and checks if the number is a divisor of the input number n. It keeps track of the greatest beautiful divisor found so far and updates it if a larger one is found. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description of finding the greatest beautiful divisor for a given input number. Since the program covers all potential cases and the examples provided work correctly, the code is correct.
