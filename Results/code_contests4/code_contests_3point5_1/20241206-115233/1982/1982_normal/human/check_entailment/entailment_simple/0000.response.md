Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It finds the greatest beautiful divisor of the input number `n` by iterating through binary numbers of the form '110', '11100', '1111000', and so on, checking if the number is divisible by each of these binary numbers. It updates the greatest beautiful divisor found so far in the variable `p`. The loop stops when the binary number exceeds `n`, and then it prints out the greatest beautiful divisor `p`.

The program always finds the greatest beautiful divisor of the input number `n` as requested in the problem description, making the correctness True.
