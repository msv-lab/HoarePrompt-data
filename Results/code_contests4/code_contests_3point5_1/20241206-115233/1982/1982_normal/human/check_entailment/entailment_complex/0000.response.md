Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It finds the greatest beautiful divisor of the input number `n` as described in the problem statement. The program iterates through binary numbers that meet the criteria of being beautiful numbers and checks if `n` is divisible by them. It updates the greatest beautiful divisor `p` accordingly and at the end prints it. The program always finds the greatest beautiful divisor for any valid input `n` as required by the problem description.
