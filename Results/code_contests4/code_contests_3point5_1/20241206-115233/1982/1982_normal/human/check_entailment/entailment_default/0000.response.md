Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic to find the greatest beautiful divisor of a given number `n`. It starts with a binary number '110' and iterates through binary numbers by adding '1' at the beginning and '0' at the end until the decimal equivalent of the binary number is less than or equal to `n`. During each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the decimal equivalent of the current binary number and updates the variable `p` accordingly. Finally, it prints the greatest beautiful divisor `p`. The code follows the problem description for all cases as it iterates through the binary numbers in the described manner to find the greatest beautiful divisor. The output hints also agree with the code and support the correctness of the program.
