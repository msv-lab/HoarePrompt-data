The function prompts the user for an integer `n`, then iterates through binary numbers starting from '110' and ending at a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal with '1' added at the beginning and '0' added at the end. During each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the decimal equivalent of the current binary number and updates `p` accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of `p`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
