Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `p`, which is the decimal equivalent of `i` such that `n % p == 0`. The initial state indicates that `n` is 28 or greater, `i` is a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal with '1' added at the beginning and '0' added at the end, and `p` is the decimal equivalent of `i` such that `n % p == 0`. Since the exact values of `n`, `i`, and `p` are unknown, the output state after executing the code is unknown.
Output State: **Output state is unknown**
