According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between the integer representation of `i` in binary form and the value of `n`. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is '110', `p` is 1. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `int(i, 2) <= n` must be true. 
1. The binary representation of '110' is 6. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be 6 or greater.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is 6 or greater, `i` is '110', `p` is 1**
