Example Answer:
The binary number stored in variable `i` is converted to an integer using the `int(i, 2)` function. Since `i` is a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal, `p` is assigned the decimal equivalent of `i`. The value of `p` changes based on the binary value stored in `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 28 or greater, `i` is a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal, `p` is the decimal equivalent of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is 28 or greater, `i` is a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal, `p` is the decimal equivalent of `i`**
