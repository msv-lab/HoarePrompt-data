According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between the integer value of `i` in binary format and `n`. If the integer value of `i` in binary format is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 6 or greater, `i` is '11100', and `p` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` in binary format needs to be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is '11100' in binary, it corresponds to the decimal value of 28. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be 28 or greater for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is 28 or greater, `i` is '11100', `p` is 1 for the loop to execute again**
