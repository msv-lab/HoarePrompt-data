Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can range from 1 to 10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^5.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^5**
