Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated by adding '1' at the beginning and '0' at the end. The previous value of `i` is '11100', so after execution, `i` becomes '1111000'. The value of `n` and `p` remains the same as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 28 or greater, `i` is '1111000', `p` is 28.
Output State: **`n` is 28 or greater, `i` is '1111000', `p` is 28**
