Example Answer:
The binary number `i` is appended with '1' at the beginning and '0' at the end. For example, if `i` is '101', after execution, `i` becomes '11010'. The other variables `n` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 28 or greater, `i` is a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal with '1' added at the beginning and '0' added at the end, `p` is the decimal equivalent of `i`. If `n % int(i, 2) == 0`, then the relationship between `n`, `i`, and `p` holds true.
Output State: **`n` is 28 or greater, `i` is a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal with '1' added at the beginning and '0' added at the end, `p` is the decimal equivalent of `i`. If `n % int(i, 2) == 0`, then the relationship between `n`, `i`, and `p` holds true.**
