According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If the integer value of `i` in base 2 is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '1111000', `n` is 28 or greater. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a binary number that is less than or equal to `n` in decimal. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is 28 or greater, `i` is a binary number less than or equal to `n` in decimal, `p` is 28**
