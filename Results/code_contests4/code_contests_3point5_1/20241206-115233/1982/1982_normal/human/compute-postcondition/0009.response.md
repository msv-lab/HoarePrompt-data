Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned the integer conversion of `i` in base 2. The value of `i` is '11100' in binary which is 28 in decimal. Therefore, after execution, `p` is 28. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 28 or greater, `i` is '11100', `p` is 28.
Output State: **`n` is 28 or greater, `i` is '11100', `p` is 28**
