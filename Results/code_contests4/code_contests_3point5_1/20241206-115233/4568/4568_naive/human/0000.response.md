Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game as described in the problem statement. The function `func_2` is supposed to determine whether the first player wins, the second player wins, or both can win (which is not possible). However, the implementation of `func_2` is incorrect and does not handle all cases correctly. Additionally, the input reading part of the code is missing `input()` function calls instead of `raw_input()`. 

Overall, the program fails to correctly determine the winner of the game according to the rules described in the problem statement.
