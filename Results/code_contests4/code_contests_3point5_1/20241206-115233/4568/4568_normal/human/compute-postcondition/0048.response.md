The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `ttree`, which is a tuple. The program has three cases:

Case 1: The program returns the integer 3.
Case 2: The program returns the integer 1.
Case 3: The program returns the integer 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a tuple `ttree` and return different integers based on the case. The program returns 3 for Case 1, 1 for Case 2, and 2 for Case 3.
