Example Answer:
`canwin` is assigned the value `False`. The variable `canloss` is already False, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ttree` is a tuple; `canloss` is False; `canwin` is False.
Output State: **`ttree` is a tuple; `canloss` is False; `canwin` is False**
