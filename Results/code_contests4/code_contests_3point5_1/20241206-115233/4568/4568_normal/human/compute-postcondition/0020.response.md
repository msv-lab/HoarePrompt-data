Example Answer:
The values of `odd_w` and `even_w` are assigned the return values of `func_1(child, 0)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `odd_w` is True and `even_w` is True. After executing `func_1(child, 0)`, the values of `odd_w` and `even_w` will be updated based on the return values. Therefore, the Output State is: `ttree` is a tuple, `canloss` is True, `canwin` is True, `node` has children for the loop to execute, `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are updated based on the return values of `func_1(child, 0)`.
Output State: **`ttree` is a tuple, `canloss` is True, `canwin` is True, `node` has children for the loop to execute, `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are updated based on the return values of `func_1(child, 0)`**
