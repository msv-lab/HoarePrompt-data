Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with arguments `child` and `0`, and returns two values assigned to `odd_w` and `even_w`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `ttree` is a tuple, `canloss` is False, `canwin` is False, `node` has children for the loop to execute, `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are returned values from `func_1`.
Output State: **`ttree` is a tuple, `canloss` is False, `canwin` is False, `node` has children for the loop to execute, `child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are returned values from `func_1`**
