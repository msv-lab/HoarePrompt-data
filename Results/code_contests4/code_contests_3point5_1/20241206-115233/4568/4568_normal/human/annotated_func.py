    #The program returns the boolean values of 'odd_ret' and 'even_ret' after running the function 'func_1' based on specific conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `node` and `level`. It recursively traverses a tree structure represented by the `node` parameter. If the current node is not None and is a word, it returns True and False if the `level` is odd, or False and True if the `level` is even. The function continues to traverse child nodes and updates `odd_ret` and `even_ret` based on the return values of the recursive calls. Finally, it returns the boolean values of 'odd_ret' and 'even_ret' based on specific conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a tuple `ttree` and iterates over its child nodes. It then calls `func_1` on each child node, checks certain conditions, and updates `canloss` and `canwin` accordingly. After the loop, it returns different integers based on the values of `canloss` and `canwin`. The function returns 3 if both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, 1 if only `canloss` is True, and 2 if neither `canloss` nor `canwin` is True.
