The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `node` and `level`. It recursively traverses a tree structure represented by the `node` parameter. If the current node is not None and is a word, it returns True and False if the `level` is odd, or False and True if the `level` is even. The function continues to traverse child nodes and updates `odd_ret` and `even_ret` based on the return values of the recursive calls. Finally, it returns the boolean values of 'odd_ret' and 'even_ret' based on specific conditions.
