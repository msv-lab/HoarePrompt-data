You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.

Given a group of n non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.

Andrew and Alex decided to play this game k times. The player who is the loser of the i-th game makes the first move in the (i + 1)-th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last (k-th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.

Input

The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Each of the next n lines contains a single non-empty string from the given group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed 105. Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.

Output

If the player who moves first wins, print "First", otherwise print "Second" (without the quotes).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- Each string in the group is non-empty and consists only of lowercase English letters.
- The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed 10^5.
def func_1(node, level):
    if (node is not None and node.isWord) :
        if (level % 2 == 1) :
            return True, False
            #The program returns True and False
        else :
            return False, True
            #The program returns False, True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Each string in the group is non-empty and consists only of lowercase English letters. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed 10^5. (node is either None or node is not a word)
    nodes = node.childs
    odd_ret = False
    even_ret = False
    for it in nodes:
        child = nodes.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, level + 1)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_ret = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_ret = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nodes` is a dictionary, `odd_ret` is True if any `odd_w` returned True, `even_ret` is True if any `even_w` returned True, `odd_w` and `even_w` are updated by `func_1` based on specific conditions.
    return odd_ret, even_ret
    #The program returns the boolean values of 'odd_ret' and 'even_ret' after running the function 'func_1' based on specific conditions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ttree is a tuple.**
def func_2(ttree):
    canloss = False
    canwin = False
    node = ttree.root.childs
    for it in node:
        child = node.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, 0)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_w = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_w = True
        
        if even_w:
            canwin = True
        
        if odd_w:
            canloss = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ttree` is a tuple, `canloss` and `canwin` are True, `node` has no more children to iterate over, `child` is the last child of `node`, `odd_w` is True, `even_w` is True

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
