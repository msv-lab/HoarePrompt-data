Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided annotated program does not directly address the requirements and constraints of the given problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not related to the game described in the problem. The functions seem to be related to some kind of tree traversal and do not implement the game logic described in the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
