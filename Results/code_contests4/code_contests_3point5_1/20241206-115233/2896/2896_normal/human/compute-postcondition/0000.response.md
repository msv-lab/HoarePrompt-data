Example Answer:
The variables p1, p2, p3, p4, a, and b are assigned integer values obtained by mapping the inputs from the user input split by space. Since the initial state specifies the range of values for each variable, the output state will reflect these new assigned values.
Output State: **p1, p2, p3, p4 are integers between 1 and 1000, a, b are integers between 0 and 31415**
