Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly reads 6 integers from the input and assigns them to variables p1, p2, p3, p4, a, and b. The function `func()` does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value, which aligns with the problem description. The program initializes the variables based on user input, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.
