#State of the program right berfore the function call: p1, p2, p3, p4 are integers between 1 and 1000, and a, b are integers between 0 and 31415.**
def func():
    p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func reads integers from the input and assigns them to variables p1, p2, p3, p4, a, and b. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value. The code initializes the variables based on user input.
