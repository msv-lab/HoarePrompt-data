Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads 6 integers from input and assigns them to variables p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b. The program does not perform any calculations or logic based on the input, so it does not have the opportunity to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, it can be considered correct as it simply reads the input values.
