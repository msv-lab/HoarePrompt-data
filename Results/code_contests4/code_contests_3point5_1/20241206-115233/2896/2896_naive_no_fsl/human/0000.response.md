Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly reads 6 integers from input and assigns them to variables p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b. The program does not contain any logic to calculate the number of integers with the given property, but since the task of counting the numbers is not part of the program, it cannot be evaluated. However, the program follows the input requirements and correctly assigns the values to the specified variables.
