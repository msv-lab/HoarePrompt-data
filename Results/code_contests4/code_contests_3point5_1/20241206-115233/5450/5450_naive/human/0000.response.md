Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two integers A and B as input and checks if A is a divisor of B. If A is a divisor of B, it prints A + B; otherwise, it prints B - A. The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases within the given constraints. For every input provided, the program produces the correct output according to the problem requirements. Hence, the program is correct.
