Example Answer:
The code subtracts the first element of the list from the second element of the list and prints the result. As the second element is guaranteed to not be divisible by the first element, the output will be the difference between the two values. 
Output State: **A and B are positive integers such that 1 <= A <= B <= 20; list is a list containing the integers entered through input split. The second element of the list is not divisible by the first element. The result of the subtraction of the second element from the first element is printed.**
