Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers A and B as input and checks if B is divisible by A. If it is, the code correctly prints the sum of A and B. If A is not a divisor of B, the code correctly prints the result of subtracting A from B. The code meets all the requirements given in the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases within the specified constraints. The output hints also agree with the code and do not suggest any additional cases that the code does not cover.
