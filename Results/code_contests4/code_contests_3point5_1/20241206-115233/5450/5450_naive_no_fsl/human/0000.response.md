Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two integers as input and checks if the second integer is divisible by the first integer. If it is divisible, it prints the sum of the two integers, otherwise it prints the difference between them. The constraints are also satisfied as the input values are within the specified range. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and all provided examples work correctly. Thus, the program is correct.
