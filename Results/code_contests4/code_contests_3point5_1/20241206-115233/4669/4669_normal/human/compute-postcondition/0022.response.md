Example Answer:
The value of `a` is appended with ')'. Since the initial state of `a` is not given, we can assume `a` is initially an empty string. After running the code, `a` will have ')' added to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0. `s` is a list. The `i-th` element of `s` is equal to '(', `a` is equal to ')'.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0. `s` is a list. The `i-th` element of `s` is equal to '(', `a` is equal to ')'**
