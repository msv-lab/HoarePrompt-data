Example Answer:
`a` is appended with ')', so if the previous value of `a` was ')', it will now be ')'. If `a` was any other character, it will now have ')' appended to it. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `s` list may have been modified according to the conditions mentioned above, `a` is set to ')', `b` may have been appended with '(' depending on the conditions.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `s` list may have been modified according to the conditions mentioned above, `a` is set to ')', `b` may have been appended with '(' depending on the conditions**
