Example Answer:
The `split()` method is used to split the string `ss` at every occurrence of '()', resulting in a list of substrings. Therefore, the output state is: N is assigned the user input value, `ss` is assigned the user input value as a string, `s` is a list of substrings after splitting `ss` at '()'.
Output State: **N is assigned the user input value, `ss` is assigned the user input value as a string, `s` is a list of substrings after splitting `ss` at '()'**
