Example Answer:
The variable `b` is appended with '('. No changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `s` list may have been modified according to the conditions mentioned above. If `s[i]` equals '(', `a` is set to ')', and `b` has been appended with '('.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `s` list may have been modified according to the conditions mentioned above. If `s[i]` equals '(', `a` is set to ')', and `b` has been appended with '('**
