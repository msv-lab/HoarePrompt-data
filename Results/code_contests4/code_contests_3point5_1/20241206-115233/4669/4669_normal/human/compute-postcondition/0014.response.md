Example Answer:
`s` is split based on the delimiter '()', which means it will split the string wherever it encounters '()'. The value of `s` is assigned the split result. The previous values of `N` and `ss` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is assigned the user input value, ss is assigned the user input value as a string; and the split result of `s`.
Output State: **N is assigned the user input value, ss is assigned the user input value as a string; and the split result of `s`**
