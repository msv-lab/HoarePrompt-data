Example Answer:
`ss` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes a user input as a string. The variable `N` is assigned the user input value, but it is not used in the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is assigned the user input value, `ss` is assigned the user input value as a string.
Output State: **N is assigned the user input value, `ss` is assigned the user input value as a string**
