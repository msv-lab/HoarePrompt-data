Example Answer:
The code joins all the substrings in list `s` into a single string, and that string is assigned back to `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is assigned the user input value, ss is assigned the user input value as a string, s is a single string after joining the substrings.
Output State: **N is assigned the user input value, ss is assigned the user input value as a string, s is a single string after joining the substrings**
