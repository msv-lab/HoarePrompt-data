Example Answer:
The string s is split into substrings wherever '()' is found. The variables N and ss are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is assigned the user input value, ss is assigned the user input value as a string, s is a single string after joining the substrings.
Output State: **N is assigned the user input value, ss is assigned the user input value as a string, s is a single string after joining the substrings**
