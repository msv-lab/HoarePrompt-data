Example Answer:
The length of the list `s` is assigned to `N`. Since `s` is initially an empty list, the length is 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is 0, ss is the user input value as a string, s is an empty list, a is an empty string, b is an empty string.
Output State: **N is 0, ss is the user input value as a string, s is an empty list, a is an empty string, b is an empty string**
