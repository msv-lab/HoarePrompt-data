Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `s` list may have been modified. If `s[i]` is equal to ')', `a` is set to ')', and `b` may have been appended with '('. If `s[i]` is not equal to ')', no changes are made to the variables `a`, `b`, and `s`. `i` is increased by 1 and should be less than `N` for the loop to execute again. If `s[i]` is equal to '(', `a` is appended with ')', and `b` is appended with '('.**
