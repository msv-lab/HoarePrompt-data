Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the input string and splits it by '()', then modifies the string based on the parentheses encountered in a loop. It continues this process until only one substring remains. Finally, it prints the modified string with additional characters added to form the lexicographically smallest correct bracket sequence. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output for all given examples. The output hints also support the code logic, confirming that the code is correct.
