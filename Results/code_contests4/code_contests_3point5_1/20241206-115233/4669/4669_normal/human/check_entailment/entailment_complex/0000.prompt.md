You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string S of length N consisting of `(` and `)`. Your task is to insert some number of `(` and `)` into S to obtain a correct bracket sequence.
Here, a correct bracket sequence is defined as follows:

* `()` is a correct bracket sequence.
* If X is a correct bracket sequence, the concatenation of `(`, X and `)` in this order is also a correct bracket sequence.
* If X and Y are correct bracket sequences, the concatenation of X and Y in this order is also a correct bracket sequence.
* Every correct bracket sequence can be derived from the rules above.



Find the shortest correct bracket sequence that can be obtained. If there is more than one such sequence, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Constraints

* The length of S is N.
* 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
* S consists of `(` and `)`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the lexicographically smallest string among the shortest correct bracket sequences that can be obtained by inserting some number of `(` and `)` into S.

Examples

Output

(((())))(((())))
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    N = input()
    ss = raw_input()
    s = ss.split('()')
    while len(s) > 1:
        s = ''.join(s)
        
        print(s)
        
        s = s.split('()')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: N is assigned the user input value, ss is assigned the user input value as a string, s is an empty list
    a = ''
    b = ''
    s = s[0]
    N = len(s)
    for i in range(N):
        if s[i] == '(':
            a += ')'
        
        if s[i] == ')':
            b += '('
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is greater than 0. The list s may have been modified. Variables a and b are lists that contain parentheses corresponding to the changes made in the loop.
    print(b + ss + a)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads user input for N and ss, splits ss by '()', then modifies the string based on the parentheses encountered in a loop. Finally, it prints the modified string with additional characters. The function does not accept any parameters and solely operates on the user input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
