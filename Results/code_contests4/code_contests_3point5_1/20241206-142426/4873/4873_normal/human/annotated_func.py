#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer. A, B, and C are strings of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    a = [raw_input().strip() for i in xrange(3)]
    foo = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        bucket = {}
        
        for s in a:
            bucket[s[i]] = True
        
        foo += len(bucket) - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is a positive integer, A, B, and C are strings of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, a is a list containing input strings A, B, and C with potentially more elements, foo is N^2 - N + m - 1, i is N, bucket contains keys `s[i]` with value `True` for each string in a
    print(foo)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It then iterates over the strings, creates a dictionary `bucket` for each character in the strings, and calculates `foo` as `n^2 - n + m - 1` where `m` is the number of unique characters in the strings. The final value of `foo` is printed. However, the function lacks a clear purpose or return value, and the calculations performed on `foo` seem arbitrary.
