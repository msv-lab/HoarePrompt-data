Output State: **N is a positive integer, A, B, and C are strings of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, a is a list containing input strings A, B, and C with potentially more elements, foo is N - 1 + m - 1, i is N+2, bucket contains keys `s[i]` with value `True` for each string in a, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than N+2, for the loop to execute the first time a is a list with at least 1 element, bucket[s[i]] is True, a still has elements left to iterate through, s[i] in bucket is set to True**
