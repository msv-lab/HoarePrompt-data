The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It then iterates over the strings, creates a dictionary `bucket` for each character in the strings, and calculates `foo` as `n^2 - n + m - 1` where `m` is the number of unique characters in the strings. The final value of `foo` is printed. However, the function lacks a clear purpose or return value, and the calculations performed on `foo` seem arbitrary.
