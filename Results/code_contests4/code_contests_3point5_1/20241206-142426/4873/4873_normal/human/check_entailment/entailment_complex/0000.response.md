Correctness: **True**

The program reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It then iterates over the strings, creates a dictionary `bucket` for each character in the strings, and calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal. The program calculates this by counting the number of unique characters in the strings and subtracting 1. This aligns with the problem description of finding the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
