Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal by iterating over each position in the strings and keeping track of the unique characters seen at that position. The program then counts the number of unique characters seen at each position and subtracts one to get the number of operations needed to change the characters at that position to be the same across all three strings. Finally, it prints the total number of operations needed.

The program follows the problem description accurately by considering each position in the strings and counting the operations needed to make them equal. This logic holds true for all possible inputs and satisfies the requirements of the problem.
