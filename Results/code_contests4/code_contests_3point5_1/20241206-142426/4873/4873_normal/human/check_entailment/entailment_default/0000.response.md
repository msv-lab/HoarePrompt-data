Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the code calculates `foo` as `n^2 - n + m - 1` where `m` is the number of unique characters in the strings. However, the code does not actually perform this calculation. Instead, it creates a dictionary for each character in the strings and increments `foo` by `len(bucket) - 1`. This means that the code is not correctly calculating the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
