Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal. It iterates over each character position in the strings and keeps track of unique characters in a bucket. The program then calculates the total number of unique characters at each position and subtracts 1 to get the number of operations needed to make all three strings equal. Since the logic seems to be correct and there are no apparent missing edge cases, the program is deemed correct.
