Correctness: False

The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal. The code only calculates the number of unique characters in each position of the three strings and sums them up. This is not the correct approach as the objective is to make all three strings equal, not just count unique characters.

For example, if we input:
4
west
east
wait

The expected output is 3, but the code will output 4.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
