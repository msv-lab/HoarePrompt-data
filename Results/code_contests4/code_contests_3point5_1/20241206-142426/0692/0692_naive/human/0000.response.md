Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input for each test case and calculates the number of days with a bad price based on the given problem description. It iterates through the prices array and checks if the price on a particular day is higher than any future day's price. If it finds such a case, it increments the `days` count. The program breaks out of the inner loop as soon as a bad price is found for a day, which is the correct logic as per the problem description. It handles multiple test cases independently, ensuring correctness for all potential cases.
