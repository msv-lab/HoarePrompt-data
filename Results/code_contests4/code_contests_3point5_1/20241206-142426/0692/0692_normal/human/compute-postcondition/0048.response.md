Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The function iterates through the list to count the occurrences where an element at a lower index is greater than an element at a higher index. The variable `days` keeps track of these occurrences. The function calculates `days` by comparing each element with all elements that come after it in the list. The function does not have a specific return value mentioned in the description provided.**
