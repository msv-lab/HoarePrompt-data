According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than the length of the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2. If arr[i] is greater than arr[j], `days` is incremented by 1, `i` may have been incremented, and `j` is at its last value. For the loop to execute another time, `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute another time `j` is at j + 1**
