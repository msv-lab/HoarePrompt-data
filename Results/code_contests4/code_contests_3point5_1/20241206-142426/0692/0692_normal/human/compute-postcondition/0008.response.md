Example Answer:
`days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is unknown, so the new value of `days` will be 1 greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, if arr[i] > arr[j], days is 1 and j is 2, days is increased by 1.
Output State: **arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, if arr[i] > arr[j], days is 1 and j is 2, days is increased by 1**
