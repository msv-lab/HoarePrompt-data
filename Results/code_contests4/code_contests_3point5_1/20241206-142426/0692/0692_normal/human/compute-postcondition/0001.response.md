According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of the list `arr` is greater than or equal to 2. The loop will run for len(arr) - 1 times. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. 
State: **arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, days is 0**
