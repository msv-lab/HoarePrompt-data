Example Answer:
The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is unknown, so the output state is: arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, days is the number of times arr[i] > arr[j] for any i < j, i is incremented by 1 and is still less than len(arr) - 1, j is 3 for the loop to execute one more time, days is incremented by 1.
Output State: **arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, days is the number of times arr[i] > arr[j] for any i < j, i is incremented by 1 and is still less than len(arr) - 1, j is 3 for the loop to execute one more time, days is incremented by 1**
