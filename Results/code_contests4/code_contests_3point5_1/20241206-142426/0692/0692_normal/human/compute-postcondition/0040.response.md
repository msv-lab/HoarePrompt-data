Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2. If arr[i] is greater than arr[j], `days` is incremented by 1, `i` may have been incremented, for the loop to execute another time `j` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
