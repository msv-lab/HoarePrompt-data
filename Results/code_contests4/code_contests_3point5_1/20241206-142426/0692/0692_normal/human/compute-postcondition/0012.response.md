Example Answer:
`days` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `days` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, arr[i] > arr[j], days is 3 and j is 3.
Output State: **arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, arr[i] > arr[j], days is 3 and j is 3**
