Example Answer: 
`days` is assigned the value 0. Since there are no other variables involved, the Output State is: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 150000 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6 for all i; days is 0.
Output State: **arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 150000 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6 for all i; days is 0**
