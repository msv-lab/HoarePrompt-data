According to the code, the loop can execute again if j is less than the length of the arr list. At the end of the previous iteration, arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, days is the number of times arr[i] > arr[j] for any i < j, i is incremented by 1 and is still less than len(arr) - 1, and j is 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, days is the number of times arr[i] > arr[j] for any i < j, i is incremented by 1 and is still less than len(arr) - 1, j is 3 for the loop to execute one more time**
