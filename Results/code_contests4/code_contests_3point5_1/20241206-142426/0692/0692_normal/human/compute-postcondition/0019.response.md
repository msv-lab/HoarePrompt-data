Output State: **arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, days is the number of times arr[i] > arr[j] for any i < j, i is incremented by 1 and is still less than len(arr) - 1, j is 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, arr[i] is greater than arr[j], days is incremented by 1**
