According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is less than the length of the `arr` list. 

Before the loop starts, it is necessary to adjust the state as follows:
State: **arr is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, days is the number of times arr[i] > arr[j] for any i < j, i is incremented by 1 and is still less than len(arr) - 1, j is 1 for the loop to execute**
