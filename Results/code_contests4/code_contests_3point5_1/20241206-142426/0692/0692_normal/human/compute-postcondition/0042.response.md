Example Answer:
`days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is unknown, so the output state is: `arr` is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute another time `j` is at j + 1, `days` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where len(arr) is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute another time `j` is at j + 1, `days` is incremented by 1**
