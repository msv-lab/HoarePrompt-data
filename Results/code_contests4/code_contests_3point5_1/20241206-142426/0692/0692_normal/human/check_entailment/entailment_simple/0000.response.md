Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of days with a bad price as described in the problem. The nested loops in the program check if the price on day i is greater than the price on day j for all i < j, which is not the correct condition to determine a bad price.

The correct condition should be to check if there exists a day j > i where the price is lower than the price on day i. The program should be modified to compare each price with all subsequent prices to find days with a bad price.
