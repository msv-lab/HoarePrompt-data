Correctness: **False**

The code does not perform as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of days with a bad price, which are defined as days where the price on a later day is lower than the price on the current day. However, the code incorrectly compares each element with all elements that come after it in the list, leading to incorrect results. For example, for the input [3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], the expected output should be 3 (for days 2, 4, and 5), but the code will produce a different result. The output hints confirm that the code does not accurately count the number of days with a bad price, making it incorrect.
