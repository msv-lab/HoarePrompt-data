Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of days with a bad price. The nested loops in the `func_1` function do not correctly check if a day has a bad price according to the problem description. 

For example, for the input:
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
The expected output is 5, as all days have a bad price. However, the program will output 0 because it is not correctly counting the bad price days. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
