Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki performs the operation zero or more times. The formula used to determine the minimum value is mathematically correct and covers all potential cases. The program is simple and efficient, providing the expected output for all valid inputs.
