Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the described operation. It calculates the absolute difference between N and K, and then takes the minimum value between N % K and K - N % K, which represents the minimum possible value taken by N after the operation is applied zero or more times. The program handles all potential cases, including the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
