Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values from the input after splitting. N and K are non-negative integers as specified, so the values are valid. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18} and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18} and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}**
