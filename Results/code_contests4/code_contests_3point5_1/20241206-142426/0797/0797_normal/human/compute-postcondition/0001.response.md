Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the minimum value between the remainder of N divided by K and K minus the remainder of N divided by K. Since N and K are non-negative integers, the output will always be a non-negative integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18} and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}, the minimum value between N % K and K - N % K is printed.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18} and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}, the minimum value between N % K and K - N % K is printed**
