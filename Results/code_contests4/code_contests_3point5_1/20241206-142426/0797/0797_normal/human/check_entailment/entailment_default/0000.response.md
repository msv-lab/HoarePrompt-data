Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads two non-negative integers N and K from the input, where 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^18, and then calculates and prints the minimum value between N % K and K - N % K. The logic of finding the minimum possible value taken by N after the operation zero or more times is correctly implemented in the code. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of what the code is doing. Overall, the code covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
