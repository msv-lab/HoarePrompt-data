Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through each element in the sequence and calculates the number of inversions for that element. It correctly calculates the number of inversions by counting the number of elements less than the current element on both sides of it. Finally, it adds the minimum of the two counts to the total number of inversions. This logic ensures that Jeff can minimize the number of inversions in the sequence by flipping some numbers to negative.

The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples. Thus, it can be considered correct as it handles all potential cases.
