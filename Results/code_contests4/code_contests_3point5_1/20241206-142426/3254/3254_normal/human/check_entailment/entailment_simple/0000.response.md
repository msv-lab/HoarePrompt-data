Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of inversions that Jeff can get by multiplying some numbers of the sequence by -1. It iterates through each pair of numbers in the sequence and calculates the number of inversions that would occur if one of the numbers is negated. It then adds the minimum of these inversions to the total count.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately determines the minimum number of inversions that Jeff can achieve by negating some numbers in the sequence. It handles all possible pairs of numbers and calculates the correct number of inversions.
