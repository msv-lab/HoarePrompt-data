The function `func` reads an integer `N`, and a sequence of integers `a` of length `N`. It then iterates through the elements of `a` and counts the occurrences of `x` and `y` based on certain conditions. The final result `ans` is the sum of the minimum occurrences of `x` and `y` for each iteration. The function prints the final `ans` value as output. The function does not return any specific value.
