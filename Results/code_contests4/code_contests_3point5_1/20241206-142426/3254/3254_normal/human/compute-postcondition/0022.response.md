Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the relationships between `a[j]` and `a[i]`, where `j < i` x will be incremented by 1, and where `j >= i`, y will be incremented by 1. The value of `ans` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y values are determined by the relationships between a[j] and a[i], ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y.
Output State: **x and y values are determined by the relationships between a[j] and a[i], ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y**
