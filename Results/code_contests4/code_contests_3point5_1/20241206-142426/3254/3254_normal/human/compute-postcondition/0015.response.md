Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2000, a is assigned the first integer value from the sequence p, ans is 0. If j < i and a[j] < a[i], x is increased by 1, y is 0. If j >= i and a[j] < a[i], x is 0, y is 1. After the if condition is executed, the state of the program variables will be determined based on the relationships between a[j] and a[i] and the values of x and y.***
