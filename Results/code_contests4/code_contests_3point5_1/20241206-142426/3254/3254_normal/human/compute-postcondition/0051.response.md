Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `ans`, `i+1`, `N` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. `a` is a list. The element at index `j` in list `a` is less than the element at index `i` in list `a`. The loop has already iterated over all elements in `a` as `j` is now greater than or equal to `i`***
