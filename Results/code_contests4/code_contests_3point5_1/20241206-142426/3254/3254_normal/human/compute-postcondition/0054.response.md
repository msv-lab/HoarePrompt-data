Postcondition: ***`x` is 1 if j < i, 0 otherwise. `y` is 0 if j < i, 1 otherwise. `ans`, `i+1`, `N` are greater than 0. `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. `a` is a list where the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `i`. The loop has either not iterated over all elements in `a` yet if j < i or it has already iterated over all elements in `a` if j >= i.***
