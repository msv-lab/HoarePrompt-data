Postcondition: ***x, y, ans, i, N, j are integers. If j < i, x is incremented by 1, y is set to 0, ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y, i is incremented by 1, N is at least 1, j is 0, a is a list of integers, a[j] is less than a[i], and j is less than i. If j is not less than i, x is set to 0, y is set to 1, ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y, i is incremented by 1, N is at least 1, j is 0, a is a list of integers, a[j] is less than a[i], and j is not less than i.***
