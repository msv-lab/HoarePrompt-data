Example Answer:
The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` is 0, so after execution, `y` becomes 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 1 if j < i, 0 otherwise, `y` is 1 if j < i, 0 otherwise, `ans`, `i+1`, `N` are greater than 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list where the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `i`.
Output State: **`x` is 1 if j < i, 0 otherwise, `y` is 1 if j < i, 0 otherwise, `ans`, `i+1`, `N` are greater than 0, `j` is 1, `a` is a list where the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `i`**
