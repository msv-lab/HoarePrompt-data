Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2000, a is assigned the first integer value from the sequence p, ans is 0. If j < i and a[j] < a[i], x is increased by 1, y is 0, and the element at index j of a is less than the element at index i. Also, j is less than i after the if condition is true. If j >= i and a[j] < a[i], x is 0, y is 1.***
