Postcondition: ***x, y, ans, i, N, j are integers. If j < i and a[j] < a[i], x is incremented by 1, y is set to 0, ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y, i is incremented by 1, N is at least 1, j is 0. If j is not less than i or a[j] is not less than a[i], x is set to 0, y is incremented by 1, ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y, i is incremented by 1, N is at least 1, j is 0, for the loop to execute a second time j must be less than N + 1.***
