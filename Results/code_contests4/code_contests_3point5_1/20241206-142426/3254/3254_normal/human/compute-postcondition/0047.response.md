According to the code, the loop can execute as long as N is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, x is 0 and y is 0, so they do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is N being greater than 0.
State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `ans`, `i+1`, `N` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
