Output State: **x, y, ans, i, N, j are integers. After all iterations of the loop have finished, x will be the total number of times x was incremented when j < i and a[j] < a[i], y will be the total number of times y was set to 1 when j was not less than i or a[j] was not less than a[i], ans will be the minimum of x and y, i will be incremented by N, N will remain the same, and j will be equal to N.**
