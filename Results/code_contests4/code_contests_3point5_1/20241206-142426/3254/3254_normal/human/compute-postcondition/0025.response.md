According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of N. If N is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, x and y values are 0 do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to x is 0, y is 0, ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y, i is incremented by 1, N is at least 1, and j is 0.

State: **x is 0, y is 0, ans is updated based on the minimum of x and y, i is incremented by 1, N is at least 1, j is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
