Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `ans`, `i+1`, `N`, `j`, `a` are all integers. If `a[j] < a[i]`, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` remains the same if `j < i`. If `j >= i`, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0. In both cases, `ans`, `i+1`, `N`, `j`, and `a` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute again, `j+1 < N`. If `j < i`, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` remains the same. If `j >= i`, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0. If `j >= i`, `ans`, `i+1`, `N`, `j`, and `a` remain unchanged and `y` is increased by 1.***
