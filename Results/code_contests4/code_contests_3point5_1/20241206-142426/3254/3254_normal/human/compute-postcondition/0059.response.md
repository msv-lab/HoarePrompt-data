Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `ans`, `i+1`, `N`, `j`, `a` are all integers. If `a[j] < a[i]`, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` remains the same if `j < i`. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to 0. In both cases, `ans`, `i+1`, `N`, `j`, and `a` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
