Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2000, a is assigned the first integer value from the sequence p, ans is 0. If j < i and a[j] < a[i], x is increased by 1, y is 0. If j >= i and a[j] < a[i], x is 0, y is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, adjust j or i based on the conditions met in the previous iteration.***
