Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2000, a is assigned the first integer value from the sequence p, ans is 0. If a[j] < a[i] (where j < i), x is increased by 1 and y values will be based on the relationships between a[j] and a[i]. If a[j] < a[i] (where j >= i), only variable y is increased by 1.***
