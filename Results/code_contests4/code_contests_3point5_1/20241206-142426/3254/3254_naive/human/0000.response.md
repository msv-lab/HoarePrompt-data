Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get in the sequence. The implementation provided does not consider the scenario where multiplying some numbers by -1 can reduce the number of inversions. It simply calculates the number of inversions without considering the possibility of multiplying numbers by -1.

Example:
Input
3
-2 1 -1

Output
2

In this case, the correct output should be 1 as multiplying the first number (-2) by -1 will result in the sequence -2 1 -1 having only one inversion. However, the given program will output 2, which is incorrect.
