Correctness: False

The program does not handle the case where the President's desk is on the boundary of the office-room matrix. In such a scenario, the program may try to access indices that are out of bounds, leading to potential errors. Additionally, the program does not properly handle the adjacency condition specified in the problem description. The adjacency check should be done in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the President's desk, but the current implementation is incorrect. 

Overall, the program does not accurately determine the amount of President's deputies in all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
