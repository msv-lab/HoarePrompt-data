According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. 
Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `m`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists, each containing m elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `col` is a string obtained from the user input, `j` is 0, all elements of `col` have been added to the respective lists in `mtrx`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
