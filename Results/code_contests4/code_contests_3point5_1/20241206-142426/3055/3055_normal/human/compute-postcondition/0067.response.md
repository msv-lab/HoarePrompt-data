According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` are as described in the precondition. In the `mtrx`, at index `i`, the element at index `j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. `i` is greater than 1, `j - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. After the if condition, `i + 1` is less than `n`, and `frnds` contains the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j + 1` are as described in the precondition, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`**
