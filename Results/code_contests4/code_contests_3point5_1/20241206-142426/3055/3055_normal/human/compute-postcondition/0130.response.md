Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j` are integers. `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1. `frnds` is updated with the value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` if `i - 1 > 0`. The positions of `i` and `j` within the matrix are adjusted for the loop. The first execution of the loop requires `m` to be greater than 0. `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.' after entering the if condition.***
