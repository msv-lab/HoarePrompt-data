Example Answer:
The `extend` method is called on the list `mtrx[k]` with the argument `col[j]`. This will append the elements of `col[j]` to the end of `mtrx[k]`. The values of `j` and `m` are not altered by this operation. Since `j` is already less than `m`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with the elements of `col[j]`, and `j` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with the elements of `col[j]`, `j` is less than `m`**
