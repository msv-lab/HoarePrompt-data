Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is less than `n`, so after execution, `k` becomes closer to `n`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists containing elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is closer to `n`, `col` is a string obtained from user input, `j` is equal to `m`, all elements of `col` have been added to the respective lists in `mtrx`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists containing elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is closer to `n`, `col` is a string obtained from user input, `j` is equal to `m`, all elements of `col` have been added to the respective lists in `mtrx`**
