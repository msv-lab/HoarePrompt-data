Example Answer:
The value at index `i + 1` and `j` of `mtrx` is added to the set `frnds`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j + 1`, `j`, `i - 1`, `frnds` are updated to include the value at index `i + 1` and `j` of `mtrx` for the loop to execute another time. Additionally, `frnds` has been updated.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j + 1`, `j`, `i - 1`, `frnds` are updated to include the value at index `i + 1` and `j` of `mtrx` for the loop to execute another time. Additionally, `frnds` has been updated.**
