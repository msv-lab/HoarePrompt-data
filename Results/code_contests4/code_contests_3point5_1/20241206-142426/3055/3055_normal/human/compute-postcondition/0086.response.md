Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j + 1`, `j`, `i - 1`, `frnds` have been updated to include the value at index `i + 1` and `j` of `mtrx` for the loop to execute another time. Additionally, `frnds` has been updated. If `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', then the loop will continue with the updated variables. If `mtrx[i][j]` is not equal to `c` or is equal to '.', then the loop will terminate after the if else block is executed.***
