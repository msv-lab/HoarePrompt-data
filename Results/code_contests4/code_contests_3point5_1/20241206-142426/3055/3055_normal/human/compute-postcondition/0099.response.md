Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` are integers. If `j - 1 > 0`, then `frnds` contains the element `mtrx[j - 1][j]` added to its set. If `j + 1 < m`, then `mtrx[j][j + 1]` is added to `frnds` and `col` is an integer. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
