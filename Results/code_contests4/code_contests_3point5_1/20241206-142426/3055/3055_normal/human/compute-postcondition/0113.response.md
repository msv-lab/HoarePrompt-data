Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j+1` are integers. If `j + 1 < m`, the element `mtrx[j][j + 1]` is added to `frnds`, `mtrx[j + 1][j + 2]` is added to `frnds`, and `col` is updated. If `i + 1 < n`, the element `mtrx[i][i + 1]` is added to `frnds`. If `i - 1 > 0`, the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` is added to `frnds`, `col`, and `j+1` are integers. Additionally, if `j - 1 > 0`, `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and if `i + 1 < n`, `frnds` is updated to include `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.***
