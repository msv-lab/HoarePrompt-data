Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` are integers. If `j - 1 > 0`, then `frnds` contains the element `mtrx[j - 1][j]` added to its set. If `j + 1 < m`, then `mtrx[j][j + 1]` is added to `frnds` and `col` is an integer. Additionally, if `i + 1 < n`, then the element `mtrx[i][i + 1]` is added to `frnds`. After executing the code, `frnds` will have the elements `mtrx[j - 1][j]`, `mtrx[j][j + 1]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][j]` added to its set.***
