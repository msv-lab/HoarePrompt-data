According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is assigned the value 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `m` needs to be adjusted such that it is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
