According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j`, `frnds` are integers incremented by 1. `frnds` is updated with the values of `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][j]` based on the conditions provided in the if statement. All the conditions mentioned in the if part are satisfied, and the values are appropriately updated. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be incremented by 1 again.
State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j` are integers incremented by 2. `frnds` are updated with the values of `mtrx[i - 1][j + 1]`, `mtrx[i][j]`, `mtrx[i][j + 2]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][j + 1]` based on the conditions provided in the if statement**.
