Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` are as described in the precondition. In the `mtrx`, at index `i`, the element at index `j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. `i` is greater than 1, `j - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` contains `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. After the if condition, `i + 1` is less than `n`, and `frnds` contains the element `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.***
