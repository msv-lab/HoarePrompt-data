Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value of `k[False]`, `m` is assigned the integer value of `k[True]`, and `c` is assigned the string value of `k[False or 2]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `c` are extracted from the input list `k` based on the indices provided by `i1`, `ii`, and `iii`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, c is an uppercase Latin letter.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, c is an uppercase Latin letter**
