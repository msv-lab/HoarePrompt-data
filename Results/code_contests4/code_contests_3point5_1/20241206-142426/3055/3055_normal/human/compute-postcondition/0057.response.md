Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists, each containing m elements from user input, `frnds` is a set containing the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `col` is a string obtained from the user input, `j` is 0, all elements of `col` have been added to the respective lists in `mtrx`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0. In the `mtrx`, at index `i`, the element at index `j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', and `i` is greater than 1. Additionally, `j - 1` is greater than 0.***
