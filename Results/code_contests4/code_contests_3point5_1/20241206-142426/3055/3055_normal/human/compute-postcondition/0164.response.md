Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `k`, `col`, `j` are integers. After all iterations of the loop, `frnds` will contain unique elements from the adjacent positions of elements in `mtrx` that are equal to `c` and not equal to '.', based on the positions of `i` and `j` within the matrix. If the loop does not execute, `frnds` will remain an empty set. Additionally, after removing '.', the set `frnds` will not contain '.'.**
