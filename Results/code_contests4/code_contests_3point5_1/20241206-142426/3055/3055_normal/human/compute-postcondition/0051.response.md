According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, since `k` is equal to `n`, it should be adjusted to `k` is 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists, each containing m elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `col` is a string obtained from the user input, `j` is equal to `m`, all elements of `col` have been added to the respective lists in `mtrx`**
