Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` are as described in the precondition. The loop will iterate through all elements of `mtrx` and update the `frnds` set based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, `frnds` will contain unique elements from the adjacent positions of elements in `mtrx` that are equal to `c` and not equal to '.'.**
