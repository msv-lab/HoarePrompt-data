According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and `m`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 2, so for the loop to execute again `j` should be incremented by 3. 
State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j` are integers incremented by 2. `frnds` are updated with the values of `mtrx[i - 1][j + 1]`, `mtrx[i][j]`, `mtrx[i][j + 2]`, `mtrx[i + 1][j + 1]`, `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][j]` if `j + 1` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 3.**
