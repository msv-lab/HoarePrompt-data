Example Answer: 
The elements of `col[j]` are added to the `mtrx[k]` list. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. The previous values of the variables are `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and `mtrx[k]` has been extended with elements of `col[1]`. After the execution, the elements of `col[2]` will be added to `mtrx[k]` if the loop continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with the elements of `col[1]`, and the loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`.
Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with the elements of `col[1]`, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`**
