Example Answer:
`frnds` has the element `mtrx[i - 1][j]` added to it. The value of `i` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j+1` are integers, `frnds` has an unknown element added to it.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j+1` are integers, `frnds` has an unknown element added to it**
