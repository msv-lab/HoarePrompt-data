According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists containing elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is closer to `n`, `col` is a string obtained from user input, `j` is 4, all elements of `col` have been added to the respective lists in `mtrx`, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with `col[j]`**
