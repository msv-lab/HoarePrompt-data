Example Answer:
`frnds` is updated to include the element `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. Depending on the previous values of `i` and `j`, the specific element added to `frnds` may vary. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j+1` are integers, with `frnds` now containing the updated element.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j+1` are integers, `frnds` updated with the new element**
