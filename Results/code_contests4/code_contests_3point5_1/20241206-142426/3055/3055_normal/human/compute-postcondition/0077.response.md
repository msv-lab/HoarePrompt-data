According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j + 1`, `j`, `i - 1`, `frnds` were updated as described in the precondition. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the values need to be updated to include the value at index `i + 1` and `j` of `mtrx`. Additionally, if `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, then `j - 1 > 0`, `frnds` must contain the value at index `i - 1` and `j` of `mtrx`. If `j - 1 <= 0`, `frnds` should be updated to include the value at index `j + 1` of `mtrx`. 

State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j + 1`, `j`, `i - 1`, `frnds` are updated to include the value at index `i + 1` and `j` of `mtrx` for the loop to execute another time**.
