Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using the space character ' '. The input string is taken from the user. The variables `n`, `m`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. The states of other variables such as `i1`, `ii`, and `iii` are also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, c is an uppercase Latin letter. The office-room description is a matrix of size n x m with each cell containing either an uppercase Latin letter representing a desk colour or a period character '.' representing an empty cell. Each desk colour is unique and represents a continuous subrectangle in the matrix. i1 is False or 0, ii is False or 1, iii is False or 2, k is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
