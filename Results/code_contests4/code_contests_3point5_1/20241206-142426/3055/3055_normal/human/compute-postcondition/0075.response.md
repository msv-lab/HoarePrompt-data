Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j + 1`, `j`, `i - 1`, `frnds` are as described in the precondition. If `j - 1 > 0`, then `frnds` contains the value at index `i - 1` and `j` of `mtrx` added to it. If `j - 1 <= 0`, no changes occur in the variables, and `frnds` is updated to include the value at index `j + 1` of `mtrx` after the execution of the if else block. After the execution of the if else block, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `j + 1`, `j`, `i - 1`, `frnds` are updated to include the value at index `i + 1` and `j` of `mtrx`.***
