Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `j` was 0, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The values of `m`, `mtrx`, `k`, and `col` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` extends `col[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` extends `col[j]`**
