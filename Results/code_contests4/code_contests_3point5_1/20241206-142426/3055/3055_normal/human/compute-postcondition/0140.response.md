Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j`, `frnds` are integers incremented by 1. `frnds` is updated with the values of `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][j]` based on the conditions provided in the if statement. All the conditions mentioned in the if part are satisfied, and the values are appropriately updated.***
