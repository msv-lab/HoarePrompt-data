The loop extends the list at index `k` in the `mtrx` 2D list with elements from `col` based on the value of `j`. The loop executes `m` times, extending the list each time with an element from `col`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the list at index `k` in the `mtrx` 2D list will have been extended `m` times with elements from `col`, and the value of `j` will be equal to `m`.
Output State: **The list at index `k` in the `mtrx` 2D list has been extended `m` times with elements from `col`, `j` is equal to `m`**
