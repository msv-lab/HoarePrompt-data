According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 which is less than `m`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists containing elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is less than `n`, `col` is a string obtained from user input, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than `m`**
