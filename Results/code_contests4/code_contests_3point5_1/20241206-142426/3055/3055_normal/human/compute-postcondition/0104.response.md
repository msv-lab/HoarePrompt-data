According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `j`, `m`, `n`, and `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are:
- `j - 1 > 0`
- `j + 1 < m`
- `i + 1 < n`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be increased by 1
- `frnds` needs to have `mtrx[j][j + 1]` added to its set
- `j + 1 < m` condition must still be satisfied

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j+1` are integers. If `j > 0`, then `frnds` contains the element `mtrx[j][j + 1]` added to its set. If `j + 2 < m`, then `mtrx[j + 1][j + 2]` is added to `frnds` and `col` is an integer. Additionally, if `i + 1 < n`, then the element `mtrx[i][i + 1]` is added to `frnds`.**
