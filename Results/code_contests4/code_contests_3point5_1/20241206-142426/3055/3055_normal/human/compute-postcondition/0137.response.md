Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `col`, `i`, `j`, `frnds` are integers incremented by 1. `frnds` is updated with the value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]` if `i - 1 > 0. `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.' after entering the if condition. `frnds` is added with the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]`. After entering the if condition, `j - 1` is greater than 0 and `j + 1` is less than `m`. Additionally, `frnds` is added with the value of `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. The if condition `(i + 1 < n)` is satisfied, and the program state meets all the described conditions.***
