According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. Since `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` extends `col[j]` for the loop to execute again, `j` is less than `m`**
