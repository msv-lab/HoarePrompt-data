Example Answer:
`i1` is assigned the value False or 0. The previous values of other variables are unknown, so the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. c is an uppercase Latin letter. The office-room description is a matrix of size n x m with each cell containing either an uppercase Latin letter representing a desk colour or a period character '.' representing an empty cell. Each desk colour is unique and represents a continuous subrectangle in the matrix. i1 is False or 0.
