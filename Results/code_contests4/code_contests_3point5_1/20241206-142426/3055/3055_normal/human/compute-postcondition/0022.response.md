According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is closer to `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists containing elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is closer to `n`, `col` is a string obtained from user input, `j` is equal to `m`, all elements of `col` have been added to the respective lists in `mtrx`, for the loop to execute again `k` is less than `n`**
