According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer and `k` is 0. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, c is an uppercase Latin letter, mtrx is a 2D list with n empty lists inside, frnds is an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time k is less than n**
