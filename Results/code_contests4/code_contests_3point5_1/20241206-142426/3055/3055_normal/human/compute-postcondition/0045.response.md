According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop executes again, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than or equal to `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with the elements of `col[1]`, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than or equal to `m`**
