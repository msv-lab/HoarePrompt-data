Example Answer:
The value of `col[j]` is added to the list `mtrx[k]`. The initial state does not provide the values of `k`, `mtrx`, `col`, or `j`, so we cannot determine the exact values of the variables after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, and `mtrx[k]` extends `col[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `mtrx[k]` extends `col[j]`**
