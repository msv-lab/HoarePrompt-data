Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j+1` are integers. If `j - 1 > 0`, and `j + 2 < m` and `i - 1 > 0`, the elements `mtrx[j+1][j + 1]` and `mtrx[j + 2][j + 2]` are added to `frnds`, and `col` is updated with an unknown element added to `frnds`. Additionally, `frnds` now contains the element `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and `mtrx[i][j + 1]` is added to `frnds`.**
