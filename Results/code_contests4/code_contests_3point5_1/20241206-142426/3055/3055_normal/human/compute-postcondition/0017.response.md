According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `m` is greater than 0. Since `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is an uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a 2D list with n lists containing elements from user input, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is less than `n`, `col` is a string obtained from user input, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `m`**
