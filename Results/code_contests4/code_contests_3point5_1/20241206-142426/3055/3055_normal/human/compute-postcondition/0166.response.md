Output State: **The code snippet prints the length of the set `frnds` after all iterations of the loop. The set `frnds` contains unique elements from the adjacent positions of elements in `mtrx` that are equal to `c` and not equal to '.' based on the positions of `i` and `j` within the matrix. If the loop does not execute, `frnds` will remain an empty set. Additionally, after removing '.', the set `frnds` will not contain '.'.**
