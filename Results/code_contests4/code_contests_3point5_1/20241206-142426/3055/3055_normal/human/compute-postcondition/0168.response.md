Functionality: **The function `func` processes an office-room description matrix and identifies unique desk neighbours based on a given desk colour. It accepts no parameters. The matrix consists of uppercase Latin letters representing desk colours or '.' for an empty cell. It iterates over the matrix, identifies adjacent desk colours to the given colour `c`, and stores them in a set `frnds`. The function then removes any '.' from `frnds` and prints the count of unique desk neighbours.**
