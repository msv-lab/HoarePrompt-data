Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `col`, `j` are integers. After all iterations of the loop, `frnds` will contain the elements surrounding the cells in the matrix `mtrx` where the value is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. The exact elements added to `frnds` will depend on the positions of `i` and `j` within the matrix.**
