Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `k` and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: j is equal to m, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with the elements of `col[0]` to `col[m-1]`, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **j is equal to m, `mtrx[k]` has been extended with the elements of `col[0]` to `col[m-1]`, `k` is incremented by 1**
