Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of President's deputies. The issue lies in the conditions within the nested loops that check for adjacent desks. The conditions `if i - 1 > 0` and `if j - 1 > 0` should instead be `if i - 1 >= 0` and `if j - 1 >= 0` respectively. This is because the indices start from 0, not 1, and we need to include the first row and column when checking for adjacent desks. 

Additionally, the condition `if ('.' in frnds)` is incorrect as it only checks if the `'.'` character is present in the set `frnds`. It should instead check if `'.'` is a separate element and not part of any desk color. 

Therefore, the program does not always correctly determine the number of President's deputies and needs to be fixed to adhere to the problem description.
