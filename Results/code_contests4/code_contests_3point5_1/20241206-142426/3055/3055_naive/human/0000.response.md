Correctness: **False**

The provided program has the following issues:
1. The condition `if i - 1 > 0` and `if j - 1 > 0` should be `if i - 1 >= 0` and `if j - 1 >= 0` respectively to handle the cases where the indices are at the beginning of the matrix.
2. The condition `if '.' in frnds` should be `if '.' in frnds:` to ensure correct handling of the presence of empty cells in the set of friends.
3. The program does not correctly handle the case when the President's desk is at the edge of the office-room matrix. It should check for the boundaries of the matrix before adding neighboring desks to the set of friends.

Overall, the program does not fully adhere to the problem description and can fail for certain input cases.
