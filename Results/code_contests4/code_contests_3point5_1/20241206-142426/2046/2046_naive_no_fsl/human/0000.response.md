Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level as described in the problem statement. The program is trying to find the sum of the absolute differences between the position of each sheep and the median position of all sheep. However, this logic is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
5
*.*.*
```
The expected output should be 2, as the sheep at position 1 needs to move 1 step to the right and the sheep at position 4 needs to move 1 step to the left to line up. But the program will output 1, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is not a valid solution for the given problem.
