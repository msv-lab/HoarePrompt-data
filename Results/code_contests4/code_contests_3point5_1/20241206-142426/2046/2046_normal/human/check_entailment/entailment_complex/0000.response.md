Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it follows the problem description. It reads the input, processes each test case correctly by calculating the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level, and prints the result for each test case. The implementation of calculating the sum of absolute differences between positions of '*' characters in a string aligns with the game rules described in the problem description. The logic used in the program correctly determines the minimum moves required to line up the sheep without any empty spaces between them. Therefore, the program is correct.
