The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes each test case to calculate the sum of absolute differences between positions of '*' characters in a string, and prints the result for each test case. It assumes a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a positive integer `n` denotes the length of the string, which contains only '.' and '*' characters. The function does not explicitly return a value but outputs the calculated sum for each test case.
