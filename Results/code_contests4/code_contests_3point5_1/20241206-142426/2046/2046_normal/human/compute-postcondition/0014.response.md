Example Answer:
The value popped from the list `af` is assigned to `n`. The list `af` now has one less element. As `l` exists and evaluates to true, it means `l` is not an empty list. The value assigned to `med` is the middle element of `l`. The absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` are calculated and their sum is appended to the list `af`. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list with one less element, `n` is an integer, `l` exists and evaluates to true, `med` is assigned the middle element of `l`, the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`.
Output State: **`af` is a list with one less element, `n` is an integer, `l` exists and evaluates to true, `med` is assigned the middle element of `l`, the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`**
