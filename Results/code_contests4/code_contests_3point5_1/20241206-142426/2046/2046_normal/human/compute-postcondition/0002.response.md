According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `le.pop()` after converting it to an integer. If the value returned is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since `af` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. Before the loop starts, the value returned by `le.pop()` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **`af` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the value returned by `le.pop()` after converting to an integer must be greater than or equal to 1**
