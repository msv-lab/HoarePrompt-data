According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `le`. If `le` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `af` has one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l` and the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`. Otherwise, `med` is undefined and the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is still appended to `af`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `le` must not be empty.
State: **`af` has one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`, `le` is not empty**
