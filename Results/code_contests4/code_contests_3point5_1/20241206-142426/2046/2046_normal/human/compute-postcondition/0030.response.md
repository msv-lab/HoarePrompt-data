Postcondition: ***`af` has one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is updated with absolute differences and indices, `le` is empty, the last element of `le` has been popped and assigned to `l`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` has the sum of absolute differences between each element of `l` and `med` appended to it. If `l` is empty, `af` has one more element appended to it.***
