Example Answer:
The code appends 0 to the list `af`. Since the initial state mentions that `af` is a list with one less element, after appending 0, `af` now has one more element than before. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list with one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`, `med` is undefined, the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`.
Output State: **`af` is a list with one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`, `med` is undefined, the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`**
