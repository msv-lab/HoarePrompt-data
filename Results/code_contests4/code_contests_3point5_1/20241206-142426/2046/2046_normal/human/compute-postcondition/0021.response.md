Postcondition: ***`af` is a list with one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l` and the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`. Otherwise, `med` is undefined and the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is still appended to `af`.***
