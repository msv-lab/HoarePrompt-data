Example Answer:
The list `l` is updated to contain the absolute differences between consecutive elements and their indices in the original list `l`. The previous state of `l` is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact values of the elements in the updated list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` has one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is updated with absolute differences and indices, `le` is empty, the last element of `le` has been popped and assigned to `l`.
Output State: **`af` has one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is updated with absolute differences and indices, `le` is empty, the last element of `le` has been popped and assigned to `l`**
