Example Answer:
A new element 0 is appended to the list `af`. The list `af` now has one more element. The value popped from `af` is stored in `l`, and since `l` evaluates to False, it means the popped value was 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list with one more element containing 0, `n` is 1 or greater, `l` is 0.
Output State: **`af` is a list with one more element containing 0, `n` is 1 or greater, `l` is 0**
