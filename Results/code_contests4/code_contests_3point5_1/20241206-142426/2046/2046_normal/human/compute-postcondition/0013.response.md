According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `le` and `af`. At the end of the last iteration, `af` is a list with one more element, `n` is 1 or greater, the popped value from `af` is stored in `l`. If `l` exists, `l` evaluates to true, `med` is assigned the value at the middle index of `l`, and the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`. If `l` does not exist, `af` is a list with one more element containing 0, and `n` is 1 or greater. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`af` is a list with one more element, `n` is 1 or greater, the popped value from `af` is stored in `l`, `l` exists and evaluates to true, `med` is assigned the value at the middle index of `l`, the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`**
