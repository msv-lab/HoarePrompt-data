Example Answer:
The value at the end of the list `af` is popped and assigned to variable `l`. If the list `af` was initially empty, an error would occur. Since `n` can be any number greater than or equal to 1, the value of `n` does not directly impact this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list with one less element, `n` is 1 or greater, and the popped value is stored in `l`.
Output State: **`af` is a list with one less element, `n` is 1 or greater, and the popped value is stored in `l`**
