Example Answer:
The value returned by `le.pop()` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. Since the loop should execute only if the value returned is greater than or equal to 1, we can assume that the value returned is 1 or greater. Therefore, after execution, `n` will hold a value of 1 or greater. The list `af` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `n` is 1 or greater**
