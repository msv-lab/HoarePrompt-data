Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of the integer popped from the end of list `le`, `le` is not empty so it contains at least one element to pop. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` has one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`, `le` is now empty.
Output State: **`af` has one more element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`, `le` is now empty**
