Example Answer:
The list comprehension calculates the difference between each element and its index in the list `l`, and stores the result in a new list assigned to `l`. The list `af` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list with one less element, `n` is 1 or greater, and the popped value is stored in `l`.
Output State: **`af` is a list with one less element, `n` is 1 or greater, and the popped value is stored in `l`**
