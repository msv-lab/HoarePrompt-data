Postcondition: ***`af` is a list with one more element, `n` is 1 or greater, the popped value from `af` is stored in `l`. If `l` exists, `l` evaluates to true, `med` is assigned the value at the middle index of `l`, and the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`. If `l` does not exist, `af` is a list with one more element containing 0, and `n` is 1 or greater.***
