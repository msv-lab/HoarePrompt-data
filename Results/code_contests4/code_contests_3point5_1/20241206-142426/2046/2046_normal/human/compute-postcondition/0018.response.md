Example Answer:
`med` is assigned the value at the middle index of list `l`. Since the list `l` has one less element than `af`, we assume `l` has an odd number of elements. Thus, `med` is the middle element of `l`. The sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list with one less element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`, `med` is the middle element of `l`, the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`.
Output State: **`af` is a list with one less element, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of absolute differences between elements in the original `l`, `med` is the middle element of `l`, the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med` is appended to `af`**
