Example Answer:
The code prints each element of the list `af` on a new line by converting each element to a string. No variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences for each iteration, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list with absolute differences and indices, `le` is empty.
Output State: **`af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences for each iteration, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list with absolute differences and indices, `le` is empty**
