Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It is not handling the moves of the sheep properly to line them up. The logic in the program seems to be calculating the sum of the differences between the positions of the sheep and the median position, which does not align with the rules of the game.

Specifically, the program is not ensuring that the sheep can only move one square to the left or one square to the right if the corresponding square is empty. Instead, it is calculating the sum of differences between positions without considering the game rules.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
