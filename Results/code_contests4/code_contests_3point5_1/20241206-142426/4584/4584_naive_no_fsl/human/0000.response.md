Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input for the number of ordered bottles, volume of each bottle, and the number of friends in the company.
2. It then calculates the capacity of each cup based on the volume of milk in each bottle and the number of friends.
3. The program then distributes the milk among the cups ensuring that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups.
4. The output is formatted as required, with the content of each student's cup printed with the bottle number and the amount of milk poured.
5. The program has validation checks for input constraints, such as the number of bottles, volume of milk, and number of friends.
6. The program logic ensures that the milk is evenly distributed among the cups without exceeding the capacity of any cup.
7. The program provides a solution if it is possible to pour the milk as required and outputs "YES", otherwise, it outputs "NO".

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides a correct solution for distributing the milk among the cups.
