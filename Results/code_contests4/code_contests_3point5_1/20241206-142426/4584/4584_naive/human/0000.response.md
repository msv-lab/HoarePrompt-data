Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in the input values for the number of bottles, volume of each bottle, and the number of friends. It then calculates the amount of milk each cup should receive based on the constraints given in the problem description.

The program uses classes to represent Bottles and Cups, and functions to distribute the milk among the cups. It checks if it is possible to pour the milk from each bottle into no more than two different cups.

The program then outputs "YES" if a solution is found along with the distribution of milk among the cups, or "NO" if no solution is possible.

The program follows the problem description accurately and provides a solution that meets the requirements for all potential cases.
