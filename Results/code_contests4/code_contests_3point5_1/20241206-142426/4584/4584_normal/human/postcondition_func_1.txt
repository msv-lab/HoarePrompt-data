The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `bottle` and `cup`, where `bottle` and `cup` are objects with specific properties. If the bottle is not empty and the cup is not full, the function checks if the amount of milk in the bottle can be poured into the cup. If it can, the cup's milk level is increased, and the bottle's milk level becomes 0.0. If the bottle has more milk than the cup can hold, the excess milk is poured into the cup until the cup is full. The function then returns True. If the bottle is empty or the cup is full, the function returns False.
