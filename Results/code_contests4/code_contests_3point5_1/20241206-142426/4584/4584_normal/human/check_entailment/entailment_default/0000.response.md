Correctness: **False**

The code may not always follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints for the functions seem to align with the code, but there is a case where the code does not meet the problem description.

In the problem description, it states that the milk from each bottle should be in no more than two different cups. However, the code does not enforce this condition. The code distributes the milk among the cups without explicitly limiting the milk from each bottle to be in no more than two different cups. This discrepancy means the code does not fully adhere to the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the specific requirement of limiting the milk from each bottle to be in no more than two different cups.
