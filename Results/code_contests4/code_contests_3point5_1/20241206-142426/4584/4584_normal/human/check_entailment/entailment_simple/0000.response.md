Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of three functions that work together to achieve the task described in the problem description. The `func_1` function is a helper function that checks if a given value is less than a small epsilon value. The `func_2` function simulates pouring milk from a bottle to a cup, ensuring that each cup receives milk from no more than two different bottles. The `func_3` function initializes the bottles, cups, and then distributes the milk among the cups using `func_2`.

The program correctly handles the distribution of milk among the cups ensuring that each cup receives milk from no more than two different bottles as required by the problem description. It also takes into account edge cases such as if there are not enough cups for each friend and returns an empty list in that case.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
