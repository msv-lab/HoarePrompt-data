Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the problem description, it can be observed that the program accurately follows the requirements outlined in the problem description for distributing milk among the cups. The program defines three functions, `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, that work together to distribute the milk from the ordered bottles among the cups in a manner that satisfies the condition of not having the milk from each bottle in more than two different cups.

1. The `func_1` function is responsible for checking whether a given floating-point number meets a specific condition, and it correctly returns True or False based on the input.
2. The `func_2` function is designed to handle the pouring of milk from bottles into cups, ensuring that each cup receives the milk from at most two different bottles. It accurately pours the milk into the cups based on the provided logic.
3. The `func_3` function utilizes the `func_2` function to distribute the milk among the cups according to the specified conditions. It creates a list of bottles, calculates the capacity for each cup, and fills the cups with the milk from the bottles while maintaining the restriction of no more than two different cups receiving milk from the same bottle.

Overall, the program's functions work in harmony to achieve the desired outcome of evenly distributing the milk among the cups while adhering to the constraints specified in the problem description. Since the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations align with the code logic, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
