    #The program returns True if x is less than eps, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a floating-point number `x` and returns True if the absolute value of `x` is less than eps in Case 1, or returns True if `x` is less than eps in Case 2. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not explicitly handle the case when x is equal to 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

If the amount of milk in the bottle is less than or equal to the space available in the cup, the cup now has more milk, the bottle is not empty, the cup is not full, and the amount of milk in the bottle is 0.0. Otherwise, `n`, `w`, and `m` remain the same, the amount of milk in the bottle is reduced by the space available in the cup, the bottle is not empty, and the cup is not full.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `bottle` and `cup`, where `bottle` and `cup` are objects with specific properties. If the bottle is not empty and the cup is not full, the function checks if the amount of milk in the bottle can be poured into the cup. If it can, the cup's milk level is increased, and the bottle's milk level becomes 0.0. If the bottle has more milk than the cup can hold, the excess milk is poured into the cup until the cup is full. The function then returns True. If the bottle is empty or the cup is full, the function returns False.

    #The program returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes three integer parameters `n`, `w`, and `m`, where `n`, `w`, and `m` satisfy specific constraints. It creates a list of bottles, assigns a capacity to each cup based on the parameters, and initializes a list of cups. Then, it iterates through the bottles, filling the cups with ingredients using `func_2`, and handles cases where bottles may not be empty or cups may be full. If certain conditions are met, the function returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups'. However, the function may also return an empty list under various cases. The functionality includes returning an empty list for different situations, ensuring cups are filled with ingredients, and handling bottle and cup interactions effectively.
