The function `func_1` accepts a floating-point number `x` and returns True if the absolute value of `x` is less than eps in Case 1, or returns True if `x` is less than eps in Case 2. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not explicitly handle the case when x is equal to 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
