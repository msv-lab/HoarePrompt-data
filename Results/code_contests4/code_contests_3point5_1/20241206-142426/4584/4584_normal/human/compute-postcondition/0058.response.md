Functionality: **The function `func_3` takes three integer parameters `n`, `w`, and `m`, where `n`, `w`, and `m` satisfy specific constraints. It creates a list of bottles, assigns a capacity to each cup based on the parameters, and initializes a list of cups. Then, it iterates through the bottles, filling the cups with ingredients using `func_2`, and handles cases where bottles may not be empty or cups may be full. If certain conditions are met, the function returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list 'cups'. However, the function may also return an empty list under various cases. The functionality includes returning an empty list for different situations, ensuring cups are filled with ingredients, and handling bottle and cup interactions effectively.**
