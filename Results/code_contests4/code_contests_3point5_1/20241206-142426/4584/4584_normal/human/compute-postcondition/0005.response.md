Example Answer:
The variable `bottle` is assigned the Bottle object at index `bi` in the list `bottles`. The variable `bi` is not given in the initial state, so its value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000; `Cup.capacity` is a float value; `cups` is a list of `m` Cup objects; `ci` is 0; `bottle` is assigned a Bottle object from the list `bottles`.
Output State: **`n`, `w`, `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000; `Cup.capacity` is a float value; `cups` is a list of `m` Cup objects; `ci` is 0; `bottle` is assigned a Bottle object from the list `bottles`**
