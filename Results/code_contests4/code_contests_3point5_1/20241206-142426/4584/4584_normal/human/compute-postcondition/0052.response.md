According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci` and `m`. If `ci + 1` is less than `m` and the cup at index `ci` is full, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ci` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ci` needs to be increased by 2 (since `ci + 1` should be less than `m`). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ci` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `ci + 1` is less than `m` and cups[ci] is full**
