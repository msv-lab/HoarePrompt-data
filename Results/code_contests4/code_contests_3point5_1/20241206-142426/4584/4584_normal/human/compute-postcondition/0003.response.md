Example Answer:
The variable `ci` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000; `Cup.capacity` is a float value, `cups` is a list of `m` Cup objects, `ci` is 0.
Output State: **`n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000; `Cup.capacity` is a float value, `cups` is a list of `m` Cup objects, `ci` is 0**
