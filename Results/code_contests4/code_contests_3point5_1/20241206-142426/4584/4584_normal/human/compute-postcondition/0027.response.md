Postcondition: ***Output State: `n`, `w`, `m`, `bottles`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups`, `ci`, `bi` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, `ci + 1` is not less than `m`, either `cups[ci + 1]` is not full or `ci + 1` is equal to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `bi` needs to be incremented by 1. `func_2(bottle, cups[ci])` is executed. If `ci + 1` is greater than `m`, the program returns an empty list.***
