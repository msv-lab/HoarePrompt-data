According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `bi`, `n`, `m`, `cups`, `ci`, and `bottle`. If `bi` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `w`, `m`, `bottles`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups`, `ci` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `bottle` is not empty, `ci + 1` is not less than `m`, and either cups[ci + 1] is not full or ci + 1 is equal to m. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `bi` needs to be incremented by 1.
