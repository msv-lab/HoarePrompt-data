Example Answer:
`m` cups are created using the Cup() class constructor. The previous values of the variables are known, so after execution, `cups` will be a list of `m` Cup objects. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000; `Cup.capacity` is a float value, `cups` is a list of `m` Cup objects**
