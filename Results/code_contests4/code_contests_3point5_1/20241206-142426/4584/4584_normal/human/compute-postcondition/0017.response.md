Output State: **`n`, `w`, `m`, `bottles`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups`, `ci`, `bottle` are integers/objects with the specified constraints. If `bottle` is not empty, then the program variables remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time, `ci + 1` is less than `m` and the cup at index `ci` is full. After executing the code `ci += 1`, the value of `ci` is increased by 1.**
