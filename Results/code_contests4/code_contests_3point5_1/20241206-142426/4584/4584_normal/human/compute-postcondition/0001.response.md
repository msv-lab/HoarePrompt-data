Example Answer:
The `Cup.capacity` is calculated by dividing the product of `n` and `w` by `m`. Given the constraints, the result will be a float value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000; `Cup.capacity` is a float value.
