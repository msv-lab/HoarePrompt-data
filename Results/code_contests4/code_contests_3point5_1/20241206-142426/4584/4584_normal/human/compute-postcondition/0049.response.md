Example Answer:
`ci` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ci` is unknown, so after execution, `ci` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ci` is increased by 1, `bi`, `bottle`, and conditions for loop execution remain unchanged.
Output State: **`ci` is increased by 1, `bi`, `bottle`, and conditions for loop execution remain unchanged**
