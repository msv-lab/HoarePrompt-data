Example Answer:
`bottles` is assigned a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights `w` ranging from 100 to 1000. The values of `n` and `w` are within the specified range, so the Output State is: `n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `w`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50; `bottles` is a list of `n` Bottle objects with weights ranging from 100 to 1000**
