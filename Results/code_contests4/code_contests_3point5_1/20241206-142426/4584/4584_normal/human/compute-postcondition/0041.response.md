Example Answer: 
After executing the function `func_2(bottle, cups[ci])`, variables `n`, `w`, `m`, `bottles`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups` are all incremented by one. `bi` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed plus 1. `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`. `ci` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed. `ci + 1` is equal to `m`. `cups[ci]` is full or `ci` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `w`, `m`, `bottles`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups`, `ci`, `bi` are all incremented by one, `bi` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed plus 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, `ci` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed, `ci + 1` is equal to `m`, `cups[ci]` is full or `ci` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`.
Output State: **`n`, `w`, `m`, `bottles`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups`, `ci`, `bi` are all incremented by one, `bi` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed plus 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, `ci` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed, `ci + 1` is equal to `m`, `cups[ci]` is full or `ci` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`**.
