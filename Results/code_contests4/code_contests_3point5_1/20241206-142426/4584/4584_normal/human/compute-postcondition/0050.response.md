According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `ci`, `m`, and the `is_full()` method of the cup at index `ci`. If `ci + 1` is less than `m` and the cup at index `ci` is full, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ci` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ci` needs to be adjusted by decreasing it by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`ci` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `ci` needs to be decreased by 1**
