According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `ci + 1 < m` and `cups[ci].is_full()`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ci` was incremented by 1, so to execute the loop again, `ci + 1` should be less than `m`. Additionally, either `cups[ci + 1]` should not be full or `ci + 1` should be equal to `m`. 

Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n`, `w`, `m`, `bottles`, `Cup.capacity`, `cups`, `ci` incremented by 1, `ci + 1` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `bi + 1` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi + 1]`, for the loop to execute again `ci + 1` should be less than `m` and either `cups[ci + 1]` is not full or `ci + 1` is equal to `m`**
