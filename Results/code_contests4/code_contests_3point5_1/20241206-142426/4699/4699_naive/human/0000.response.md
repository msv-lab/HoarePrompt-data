Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal incorrectly. The function `func_1` does not consider all potential cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. 

One potential case where the program fails to produce the correct output is when the number of cells (n) is odd and the number of moves allowed (m) is less than the required moves to redistribute the diamonds without triggering the security system. In this case, the program returns 0 as the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
