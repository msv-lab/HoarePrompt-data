Example Answer:
The length of list A is assigned to the variable n. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in list A, the output state is: A is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 10000 and each integer is between 0 and 105, m and k are positive integers where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9, n is the length of list A.
Output State: **A is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 10000 and each integer is between 0 and 105, m and k are positive integers where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9, n is the length of list A**
