Example Answer:
The variable `moves` is assigned the value of `n / 2 + 1`. Since `n` is the length of list A and is not divisible by 2, the value of `n / 2` will result in a fractional value. Therefore, `moves` will be a float value representing the number of moves. 
Output State: **`moves` is a float representing the number of moves**
