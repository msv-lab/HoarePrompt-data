Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of `n` integers `A`, where the length of the list `n` is between 1 and 10000 and each integer in the list is between 0 and 105, and two positive integers `m` and `k` where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9. The function returns different values based on specific conditions: 
- Case_1: Returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of `m` and `k`.
- Case_2: Returns 0 if the length of list A (`n`) is even.
- Case_3: Returns 0.
- Case_4: Returns the minimum value between the minimum of alternate elements in list A and the result of the calculation `(m / moves * k)`.
The functionality does not cover the scenario where the length of list A is odd, which could be considered as a missing edge case.**
