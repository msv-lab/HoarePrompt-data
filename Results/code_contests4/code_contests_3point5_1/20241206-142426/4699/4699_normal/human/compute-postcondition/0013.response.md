The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of n integers `A`, where the length of the list n is between 1 and 10000 and each integer in the list is between 0 and 105, and two positive integers `m` and `k` where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9.

After executing the function body, the program returns different values based on different conditions:

Case_1: The program returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of m and k.

Case_2: The program returns 0 if the length of list A (n) is even.

Case_3: The program returns 0.

Case_4: The program returns the minimum value between `m` and the result of the calculation (m / moves * k).

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `A`, and two positive integers `m` and `k`, and return different values based on the conditions mentioned above.
