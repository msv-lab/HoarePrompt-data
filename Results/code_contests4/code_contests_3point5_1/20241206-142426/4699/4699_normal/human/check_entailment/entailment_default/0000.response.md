Correctness: **False**

The code does not cover the scenario where the length of list A is odd, which is a missing edge case according to the problem description. The function `func_1` only handles cases where the length of list A is even. This means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Additionally, the output hints correctly highlight the edge case where the length of the list A is odd and the code does not handle it. Therefore, based on the output hints and the code itself, the correctness of the code is deemed false as it does not cover all potential cases as per the problem description.
