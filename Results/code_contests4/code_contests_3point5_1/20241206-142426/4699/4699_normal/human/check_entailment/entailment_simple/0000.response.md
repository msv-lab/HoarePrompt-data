Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal based on the given constraints of the number of cells, moves allowed, and time available. It considers the cases where the number of cells is 1, even, and odd, and calculates the maximum amount of diamonds Joe can carry accordingly. The program ensures that the security system is not triggered and that Joe leaves before morning while maximizing the number of diamonds he steals.
