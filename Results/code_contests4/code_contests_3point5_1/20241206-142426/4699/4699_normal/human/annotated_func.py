#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 10000 and each integer is between 0 and 105, m and k are positive integers where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9.**
def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if (n == 1) :
        return min(A[0], m * k)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of m and k
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *A is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 10000 and each integer is between 0 and 105, m and k are positive integers where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9, n is the length of list A. The length of list A is not equal to 1
    if (n % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 after entering the if condition where n is even
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *A is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 10000 and each integer is between 0 and 105, m and k are positive integers where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9, n is the length of list A. The length of list A is not equal to 1. n is not divisible by 2
    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if (moves > m) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`moves` is a float representing the number of moves. `moves` is less than or equal to `m`
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
    #The program returns the minimum value between 'M' and the result of the calculation (m / moves * k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of `n` integers `A`, where the length of the list `n` is between 1 and 10000 and each integer in the list is between 0 and 105, and two positive integers `m` and `k` where 1 <= m, k <= 10^9. The function returns different values based on specific conditions: 
- Case_1: Returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of `m` and `k`.
- Case_2: Returns 0 if the length of list A (`n`) is even.
- Case_3: Returns 0.
- Case_4: Returns the minimum value between the minimum of alternate elements in list A and the result of the calculation `(m / moves * k)`.
The functionality does not cover the scenario where the length of list A is odd, which could be considered as a missing edge case.
