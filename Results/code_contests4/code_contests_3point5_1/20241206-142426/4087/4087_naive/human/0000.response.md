Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. One potential case where the program fails is when the input sequence contains duplicate elements. For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 2 1 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
3
5
4
1
```
However, the program may not handle this case correctly due to the way it calculates subsequences based on the index of elements in the sequence. It may not account for duplicate elements correctly leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
