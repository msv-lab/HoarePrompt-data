Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program lacks a clear and specific functionality description, making it difficult to determine if it accurately calculates the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k as specified in the problem description.

Furthermore, the code contains several issues:
1. The calculation of `ans` and `x` using division (`/`) will result in floating-point numbers, which may not accurately represent the required values for the subsequences.
2. The modulo operation (`% mask`) is applied incorrectly after printing the values, and it should be done before printing to ensure that the output remains within the constraints.
3. The program lacks clear variable naming and explanation of the calculations being performed, making it hard to understand the purpose of each step.

Overall, the program does not provide a clear and correct solution to the problem described, and it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
