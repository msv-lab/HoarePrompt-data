Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately follow the problem description for every potential case. 
- The code lacks clear comments or explanations for the calculations being performed, making it difficult to understand the purpose and correctness of the operations.
- The code has potential issues with the calculation of the variables `left` and `right`, which are used in subsequent calculations. These variables are calculated based on finding the first repeated element in the sequence, but the logic for determining `left` and `right` is not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect results.
- The code uses division operations on large numbers without considering integer division or modulo operations, which may result in incorrect numerical values.
- The code implementation is complex and lacks clarity in terms of the expected output for each value of `k`.

Based on the lack of clarity in the code and the potential issues mentioned above, the correctness of the program is questionable and may not adhere to the problem description for all cases.
