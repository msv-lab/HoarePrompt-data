You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an integer sequence of length n+1, a_1,a_2,...,a_{n+1}, which consists of the n integers 1,...,n. It is known that each of the n integers 1,...,n appears at least once in this sequence.

For each integer k=1,...,n+1, find the number of the different subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

* 1 \leq n \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_i \leq n
* Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence.
* n and a_i are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


n
a_1 a_2 ... a_{n+1}


Output

Print n+1 lines. The k-th line should contain the number of the different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a_i are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, re.split('\\s', raw_input()))
    left = 0
    right = 0
    mask = 10 ** 9 + 7
    pow = [0] * n + 2
    tmp = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 2):
        tmp *= i
        
        pow[i] = tmp
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is incremented by 1, `right` remains 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+2 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+2
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        x = a.index(a[i])
        
        if a[i] in a[x + 1:]:
            left = i
            right = a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `right` is updated based on the calculation `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`, `mask` remains at 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+3 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+3, `i` is n+2, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `left` is assigned the value of `i`. The loop executes until it finds the first repeated element in the list `a`, updating `right` accordingly, and then terminates.
    for i in range(1, n + 2):
        ans = pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])
        
        x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
        
        print(ans - x) % mask
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All variables maintain their values as described in the initial state, and the loop does not affect the values of any variables directly.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
