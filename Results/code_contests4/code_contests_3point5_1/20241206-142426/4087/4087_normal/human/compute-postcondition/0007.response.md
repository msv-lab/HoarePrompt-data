According to the code, the loop will execute for values of i from 1 to n+1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `a_i` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence, `a` is a mapped list of integers from the input, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` is a list initialized to contain n+2 zeros, `tmp` is 1, for the loop to execute `i` ranges from 1 to n+1**
