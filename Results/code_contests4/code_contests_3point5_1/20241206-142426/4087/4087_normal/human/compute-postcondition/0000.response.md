Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can range from 1 to 10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a_i are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a_i are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence.**
