According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `n + 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is incremented by 1, so it must be incremented again, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+4 zeros with `tmp` as the product of all numbers from 1 to n+3 multiplied by `i`, and `pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is incremented by 1, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+4 zeros with `tmp` as the product of all numbers from 1 to n+3 multiplied by `i`, and `pow[i]` is assigned the value of `tmp` for the next iteration**
