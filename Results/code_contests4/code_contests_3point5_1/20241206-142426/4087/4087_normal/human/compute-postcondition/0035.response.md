Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `right` is updated based on the calculation `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`, `mask` remains at 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+3 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+3, `i` is n+2, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `left` is assigned the value of `i`, `x` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `right` is updated based on the calculation `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1***
