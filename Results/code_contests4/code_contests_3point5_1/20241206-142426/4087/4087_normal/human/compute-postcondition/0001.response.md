Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the result of mapping the integers obtained by splitting the input string using spaces. Since the input values are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a_i are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence, `a` is a mapped list of integers from the input.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a_i are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence, `a` is a mapped list of integers from the input.**
