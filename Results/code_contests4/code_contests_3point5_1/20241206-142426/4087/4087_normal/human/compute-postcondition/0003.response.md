Example Answer:
The variable `right` is assigned the value 0. Since there are no other variables or operations affecting the initial state, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `a_i` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence, `a` is a mapped list of integers from the input, `right` is 0**
