Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `right` is updated based on the calculation `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`, `mask` remains at 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+4 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+3, `i` is n+4, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `left` is assigned the value of `i`, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 2, `ans` is assigned the value of `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`, `x` is now assigned the value of `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1]`, `x` is now assigned the value of `pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1]`. A calculation is performed `(ans - x) % mask` and the result is printed.**
