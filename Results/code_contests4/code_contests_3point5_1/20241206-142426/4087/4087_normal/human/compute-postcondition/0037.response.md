According to the code, the loop will execute until it finds the first repeated element in the list `a`. This means the loop will execute at least once if `n >= 1`. 

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the loop will execute by adjusting the state variables. Since the loop starts from `1`, `n` must be at least `1`. Additionally, since the loop executes until it finds the first repeated element in the list `a`, we need to adjust the state of `x` to represent the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `right` is updated based on the calculation `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`, `mask` remains at 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+3 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+3, `i` is n+2, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `left` is assigned the value of `i`, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 1 and `x` represents the index of the first occurrence of element `a[i]` in the list `a`.**
