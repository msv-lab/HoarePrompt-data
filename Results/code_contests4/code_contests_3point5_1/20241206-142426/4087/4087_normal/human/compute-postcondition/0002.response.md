Example Answer:
The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. Since the code snippet provided does not have any impact on the values of variables related to the given initial state, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a_i are integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence, `a` is a mapped list of integers from the input**
