According to the code, the loop will execute from 0 to n, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `right` is updated based on the calculation `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`, `mask` remains at 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+2 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+2, `i` is n, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `left` has the value of `i`. After the execution of the if else block, the program retains the same initial conditions with the addition of `right` being updated based on the calculation mentioned and `left` taking the value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `right` is updated based on the calculation `a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1`, `mask` remains at 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+2 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+2, `i` is n+1, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of the element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `left` is assigned the value of `i`**.
