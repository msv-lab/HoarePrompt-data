According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is already incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since the loop starts from 0, `i` should be set to 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `right` is 0, `mask` is 10^9 + 7, `pow` contains n+2 zeros with each element representing the product of all numbers from 1 to the corresponding index, `tmp` is the product of all numbers from 1 to n+2, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute**
