Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k. The logic in the program is flawed and does not adhere to the problem description.

Additionally, the program contains syntax errors and uses the `raw_input()` function, which is not valid in Python 3. The program should be modified to use `input()` instead of `raw_input()`. 

Overall, the program needs to be rewritten to correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
