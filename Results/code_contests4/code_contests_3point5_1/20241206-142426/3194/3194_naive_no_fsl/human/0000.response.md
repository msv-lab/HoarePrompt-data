Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly check for central symmetry as described in the problem description. It only checks for specific cases of symmetry, but not all possible symmetric configurations. For example, if the input is:

```
X..
.X.
..X
```

The program will output 'YES', but this is incorrect as the password is not symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. Hence, the program is incorrect.
