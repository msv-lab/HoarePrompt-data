According to the code, the loop will execute 3 times since the range is specified as 3. At the end of the last iteration, the input matrix is a 3x3 grid, `lines` contains the input line, and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so `i` should be 3.
State: **The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing only the symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains the input line, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute the fourth time**
