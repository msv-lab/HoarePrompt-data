Example Answer:
A line is read from the standard input and appended to the `lines` list. The `lines` list now contains the input line. The loop executes for the first time, so `i` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing only the symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains the input line, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing only the symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains the input line, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
