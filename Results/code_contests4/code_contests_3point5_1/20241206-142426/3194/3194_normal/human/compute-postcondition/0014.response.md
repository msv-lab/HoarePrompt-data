Functionality: The function `func` reads input lines to form a 3x3 grid matrix containing only 'X' and '.' symbols. It then checks specific patterns around 'X' positions in the matrix. If any of these patterns are found, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output based on the input grid.
