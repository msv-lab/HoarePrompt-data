Example Answer:
The `lines` list appends a new line read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. The input matrix is a 3x3 grid, so after the execution of this code, `lines` will contain 4 lines with the last line being the input read from the standard input. The value of `i` being 3 indicates that the loop has executed 3 times and is now executing the fourth time. Therefore, the Output State is: The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing only the symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains 4 lines with the last line read from standard input, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute the fourth time.
Output State: **The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing only the symbols 'X' and '.', `lines` contains 4 lines with the last line read from standard input, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute the fourth time**
