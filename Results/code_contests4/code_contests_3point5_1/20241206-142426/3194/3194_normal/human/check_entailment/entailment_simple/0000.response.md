Correctness: **True**

The program reads a 3x3 grid of symbols 'X' and '.' from the input, and then checks if the input password is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. It does so by checking specific conditions to determine if the password is symmetric. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program follows the problem description accurately as it correctly checks for the symmetry of the password based on the input grid. It covers all possible cases where the password can be symmetric or not, and prints the correct output accordingly.
