Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads input lines to form a 3x3 grid matrix containing only 'X' and '.' symbols. It then checks specific patterns around 'X' positions in the matrix. If any of these patterns are found, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, as it checks for symmetry with respect to the central button of the terminal. The code correctly determines if the password is symmetric or not based on the input grid. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, indicating that the code is correct.
