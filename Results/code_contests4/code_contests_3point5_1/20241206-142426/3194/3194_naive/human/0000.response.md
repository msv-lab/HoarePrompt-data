Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input matrix and checks whether the password is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. It checks all the possible symmetric positions and outputs 'YES' if the password is symmetric and 'NO' otherwise. The logic is sound and covers all the possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
