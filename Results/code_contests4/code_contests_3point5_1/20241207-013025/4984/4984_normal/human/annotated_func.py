#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `p` and `x`, where 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9. It iterates through a nested loop to generate a list of strings that meet certain conditions. The function then sorts this list and returns the first element that does not start with '0'. If all elements start with '0', it returns an empty string. The annotations provide detailed explanations of the loop's behavior, including conditions for appending to the list and sorting. The actual code seems to follow this logic, handling cases where certain conditions are met.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two positive integers `p` and `x` from the user input. If `x` is 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, it calculates and outputs the result of `p` divided by 42. Otherwise, it iterates through a loop from 1 to 999, calling `func_1` with different values of `i` and `x`. If the result of `func_1` is non-empty, it checks if `p` is divisible by the length of the result. If so, it outputs the result repeated `p / length` times. If not, it outputs 'Impossible'. If none of these conditions are met, it outputs 'Impossible' for all iterations of the loop.
