Example Answer:
The value of `b` is appended to the list `a`, resulting in `a` containing the original value of `i` and the updated value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is a list, `i` is in the range 1 to 10, `s` is updated with the new result of the division operation, `b` is the updated remainder of the division operation, `a` contains the original value of `i` and the updated value of `b`, `p` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `p.
Output State: **`c` is a list, `i` is in the range 1 to 10, `s` is updated with the new result of the division operation, `b` is the updated remainder of the division operation, `a` contains the original value of `i` and the updated value of `b`, `p` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `p**
