Example Answer:
`p` and `x` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`. The values of `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 9.
Output State: **`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 9**
