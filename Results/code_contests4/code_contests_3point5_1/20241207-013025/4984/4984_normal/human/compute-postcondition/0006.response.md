Example Answer:
The function `func_1()` is called with parameters `i` and `x`. The values of `i` and `x` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact result of the function call. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 9.
Output State: **`p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 9**
