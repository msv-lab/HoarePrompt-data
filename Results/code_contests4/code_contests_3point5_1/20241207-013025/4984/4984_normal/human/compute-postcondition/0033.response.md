Postcondition: ***Output State: `c` is a list, `i` is in the range 1 to 9, `s` is the final result after all iterations of the loop, `b` is the final remainder after all iterations of the loop, `a` contains all the appended values of `b` throughout the loop, `p` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `p` - 1. If `b` is equal to `i` and `s` is equal to 0, then all the mentioned conditions hold true***
