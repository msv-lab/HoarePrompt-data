Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is appended to the list `a`. The value of `b` is the remainder of `divmod(b * x + s, 10)`, which is already calculated and stored. Therefore, after execution, the list `a` will contain the appended value of `b`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`c` is a list, `i` is in the range 1 to 9, `s` is the result of `divmod(b * x + s, 10)`, `b` is the remainder of `divmod(b * x + s, 10)`, `a` contains the appended value of `b`, `p` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 1 for the loop to execute again**
