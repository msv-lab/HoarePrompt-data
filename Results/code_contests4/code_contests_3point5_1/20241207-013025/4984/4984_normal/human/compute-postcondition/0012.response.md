Example Answer:
The string `s` is repeated `p / l` times and the result is printed. Since `p` is divisible by `l`, the division is an integer division. Therefore, the string `s` will be repeated `p / l` times without any decimal values. Hence, the Output State is: `p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, the length of string `s` is assigned to `l`, and `s` is repeated `p / l` times.
Output State: **`p` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, the length of string `s` is assigned to `l`, and `s` is repeated `p / l` times**
