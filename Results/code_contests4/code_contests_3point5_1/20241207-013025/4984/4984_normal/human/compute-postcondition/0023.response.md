Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads two positive integers `p` and `x` from the user input. If `x` is 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, it calculates and outputs the result of `p` divided by 42. Otherwise, it iterates through a loop from 1 to 999, calling `func_1` with different values of `i` and `x`. If the result of `func_1` is non-empty, it checks if `p` is divisible by the length of the result. If so, it outputs the result repeated `p / length` times. If not, it outputs 'Impossible'. If none of these conditions are met, it outputs 'Impossible' for all iterations of the loop.**
