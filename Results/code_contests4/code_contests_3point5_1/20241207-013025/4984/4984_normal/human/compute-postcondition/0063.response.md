Postcondition: ***After sorting, the list `c` containing strings of numbers that satisfy the conditions `b == i` and `s == 0` is sorted in ascending order. The first element of `r` is the next element in the sorted list. If `r[0]` is not equal to '0', the program returns the next element in the sorted list `c` after sorting elements that satisfy the conditions `b == i` and `s == 0` in ascending order.***
