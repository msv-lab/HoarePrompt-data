Example Answer: 
The function `func_1(42, 5)` returns a value, which is then multiplied by `(p / 42)`. Given that `p` is a multiple of 42 and `x` is 5, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `p` ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 9. The value of `x` is 5, `p` is a multiple of 42, and a calculation based on the return value of `func_1(42, 5)` multiplied by `(p / 42)`**
