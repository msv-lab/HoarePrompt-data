Example Answer:
The length of the string `s` is assigned to the variable `l`. The value of `s` is not given in the initial state, so the output state will be: `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 9, and the length of string `s` is assigned to `l`.
Output State: **`p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 9, and the length of string `s` is assigned to `l`**
