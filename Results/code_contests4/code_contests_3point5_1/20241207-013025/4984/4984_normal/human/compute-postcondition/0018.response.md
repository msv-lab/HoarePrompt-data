Example Answer:
The program calls a function `func_1` with arguments `i` and `x`, but the program cannot execute the function due to the statement 'Impossible'. Therefore, no changes occur to the initial state.
Output State: **The program cannot execute the loop further, as indicated by the output 'Impossible'**
