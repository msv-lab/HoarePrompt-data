The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The program contains two cases:

Case 1: The program returns the value of `p` divided by 42.

Case 2: The program outputs 'Impossible' for all iterations of the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to either return the value of `p` divided by 42 or output 'Impossible' for all iterations of the loop.
