Example Answer:
The list `a` is initialized as an empty list. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is a list, `i` is in the range 1 to 10, `s` is 0, `b` is now equal to the value of `i`, `a` is an empty list, `p` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `p` - 1.
Output State: **`c` is a list, `i` is in the range 1 to 10, `s` is 0, `b` is now equal to the value of `i`, `a` is an empty list, `p` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `p` - 1**
