You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Teacher thinks that we make a lot of progress. Now we are even allowed to use decimal notation instead of counting sticks. After the test the teacher promised to show us a "very beautiful number". But the problem is, he's left his paper with the number in the teachers' office.

The teacher remembers that the "very beautiful number" was strictly positive, didn't contain any leading zeroes, had the length of exactly p decimal digits, and if we move the last digit of the number to the beginning, it grows exactly x times. Besides, the teacher is sure that among all such numbers the "very beautiful number" is minimal possible.

The teachers' office isn't near and the teacher isn't young. But we've passed the test and we deserved the right to see the "very beautiful number". Help to restore the justice, find the "very beautiful number" for us!

Input

The single line contains integers p, x (1 ≤ p ≤ 106, 1 ≤ x ≤ 9).

Output

If the teacher's made a mistake and such number doesn't exist, then print on a single line "Impossible" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the "very beautiful number" without leading zeroes.

Examples

Input

6 5


Output

142857

Input

1 2


Output

Impossible


Input

6 4


Output

102564

Note

Sample 1: 142857·5 = 714285.

Sample 2: The number that consists of a single digit cannot stay what it is when multiplied by 2, thus, the answer to the test sample is "Impossible".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p and x are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9.**
def func_1(p, x):
    c = []
    for i in xrange(1, 10):
        s = 0
        
        b = i
        
        a = []
        
        for j in xrange(p):
            a.append(b)
            s, b = divmod(b * x + s, 10)
        
        if b == i and s == 0:
            a.reverse()
            c.append(''.join(map(str, a)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `c` is a list containing strings of numbers that satisfy the conditions `b == i` and `s == 0` after the division operations, `i` is in the range 1 to 9, `s` is the final result after all iterations of the loop, `b` is the final remainder after all iterations of the loop, `a` contains all the appended values of `b` throughout the loop, `p` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `p` - 1.
    c.sort()
    for r in c:
        if r[0] != '0':
            return r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the first element of `c` is not '0', then the loop will return the first element of `c` that does not start with '0'. If all elements of `c` start with '0', then there is no change to the state of the program.
    return ''
    #The program returns an empty string if all elements of 'c' start with '0'. If the first element of 'c' does not start with '0, then the program returns the first element of 'c' that does not start with '0'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 9.**
def func_2():
    p, x = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if (x == 5 and p % 42 == 0) :
        stdout.write(func_1(42, 5) * (p / 42))
        return
        #The program returns the value of `p` divided by 42
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 9. The condition (x is not equal to 5 or p is not divisible by 42) is true
    for i in xrange(1, 1000):
        s = func_1(i, x)
        
        if not s:
            continue
        
        l = len(s)
        
        if p % l == 0:
            stdout.write(s * (p / l))
        else:
            stdout.write('Impossible')
        
        return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The program outputs 'Impossible' for all iterations of the loop


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
