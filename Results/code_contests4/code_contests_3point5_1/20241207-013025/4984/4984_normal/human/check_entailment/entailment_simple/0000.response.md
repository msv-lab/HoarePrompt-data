Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` seems to be attempting to find the "very beautiful number" based on the conditions given in the problem description. However, the logic within the function is incorrect and does not produce the correct output.

The function `func_2` also does not correctly handle the cases as described in the problem description. The condition `(x == 5 and p % 42 == 0)` does not relate to the requirements of the problem and produces a result based on a different calculation.

Overall, the program does not correctly find the "very beautiful number" as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
