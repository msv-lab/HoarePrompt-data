Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to correctly implement the logic required to find the "very beautiful number" as described in the problem. The annotations provide detailed explanations of the program state before and after function calls, as well as the conditions checked within the loops. The code seems to handle cases where the number must be strictly positive, cannot contain leading zeros, and must meet the growth condition when the last digit is moved to the beginning.

Additionally, the code includes a check for the edge case where the number does not exist (e.g., when the number consists of a single digit and cannot be multiplied by x to achieve the required growth). Overall, based on the code, annotations, and problem description, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified.
