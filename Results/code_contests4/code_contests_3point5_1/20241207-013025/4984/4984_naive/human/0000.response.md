Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to find the "very beautiful number" given the constraints provided in the problem description. It checks all possible numbers from 1 to 9 and calculates if moving the last digit to the beginning grows the number x times. It then sorts the valid numbers and returns the minimum possible number without leading zeroes. The program also handles the case where the number does not exist by returning "Impossible". The implementation seems to be correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem.
