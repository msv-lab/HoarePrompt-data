Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program first defines a function `func_1` that generates all possible "very beautiful numbers" based on the given conditions. It then defines a function `func_2` to handle the input and output logic.

The program correctly handles the case when a "very beautiful number" does not exist by returning "Impossible" as required. It also correctly finds and outputs the minimal possible "very beautiful number" that meets the given conditions by iterating through all possible numbers up to 1000.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
