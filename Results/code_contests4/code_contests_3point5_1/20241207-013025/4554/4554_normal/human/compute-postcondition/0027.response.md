Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing at least `n` integers with the element at index `i` divided by 2 if it is even, where `i` is 0, `x` is the last integer entered in list `a`, `b` is a list containing the integer result of dividing the element at index `i` by 2 if the element at index `i` is even and the element at index `i` appended from list `a`, `count` is 1 and `count` is odd. If `count` is even, `a` is updated with the element at index `i` divided by 2, `b` contains the updated element at index `i`, and `count` is even.***
