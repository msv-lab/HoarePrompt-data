Example Answer:
After executing the code snippet, the value of `x` is appended to the list `a`. The value of `x` is taken as an input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `x` is an input integer**
