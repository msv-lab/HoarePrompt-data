Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `a`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
