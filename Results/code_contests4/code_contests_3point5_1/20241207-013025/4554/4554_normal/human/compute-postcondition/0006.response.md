Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `a`, `i`, and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
