Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing at least `n` integers, `i` is 0, `x` is the last integer entered in list `a`, `b` is a list containing the integer result of dividing the element at index `i` by 2 if the element at index `i` is even and the element at index `i` appended from list `a`, `count` is 1 if initially odd, and `count` is even if initially even. If `a[i] % 2 != 0`, then `a` is updated with the element at index `i` divided by 2, `b` contains the updated element at index `i`, and `count` is even.***
