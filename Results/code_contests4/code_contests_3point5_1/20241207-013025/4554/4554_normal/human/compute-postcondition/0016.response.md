Example Answer: 
`b` appends the result of dividing the element at index `i` in list `a` by 2. Since the element at index `i` in list `a` is an even number, the result will be an integer. Therefore, `b` will contain the integer result of the division. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`a` is a list containing at least `n` integers, `i` is 0, `x` is the last integer entered in list `a`, `b` is a list containing the integer result of dividing the element at index `i` in list `a` by 2, `count` is 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is an even number**
