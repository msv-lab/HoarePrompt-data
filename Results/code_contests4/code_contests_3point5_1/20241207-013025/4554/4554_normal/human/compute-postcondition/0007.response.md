Example Answer:
`x` is appended to list `a`, so after execution, `a` will contain `x` as an additional element. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
