Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing `x`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `x` is an input integer**
