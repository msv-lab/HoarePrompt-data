Postcondition: ***`a` is a list updated with the division result at index `i+2`, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is the last integer entered in the updated list `a`, `b` contains the result of the division of the element at index `i+1` of list `a` by 2, `count` is odd after the execution of the program fragment in the if statement for the loop to execute a second time, `b` is appended with the division result of `a[i] / 2` if `a[i]` is even, `count` is incremented by 1.***
