Example Answer:
An empty list `b` is created. Since the existing variables `a`, `i`, and `x` are not used in the code snippet, their values remain the same.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing `n` integers entered through input, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is the last integer entered, `b` is an empty list**
