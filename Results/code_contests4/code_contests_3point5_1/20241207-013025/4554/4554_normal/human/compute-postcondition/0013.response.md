Example Answer:
The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing `n` integers entered through input, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is the last integer entered, `b` is an empty list, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing `n` integers entered through input, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is the last integer entered, `b` is an empty list, `count` is 0**
