The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing a set of integers `a_i` where the sum of all `a_i` is equal to 0. The function must handle a constraint where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 13845, and each `a_i` is an integer such that -336 <= a_i <= 1164. The function should ensure that the sum of all `a_i` is equal to 0. Since the function does not accept any parameters, it is expected to process the given set of integers `a_i` to meet the specified constraints. 
Functionality: **The function processes a set of integers a_i, ensuring that the sum of all a_i is equal to 0, while adhering to the constraints provided for n and the range of each a_i.**
