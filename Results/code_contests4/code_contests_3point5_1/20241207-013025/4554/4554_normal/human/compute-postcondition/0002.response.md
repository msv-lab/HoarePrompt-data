According to the code, the loop can execute if the range `n` is at least 1. Since `a` is an empty list, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to the first value in the range of `n`.
State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
