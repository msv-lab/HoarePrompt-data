Postcondition: ***`a` is a list updated with the division result at index `i+1`, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is the last integer entered in list `a`, `b` contains the result of the division of the element at index `i` of list `a` by 2, `count` is odd after the execution of the program fragment in the if statement. If count % 2 == 0, `b` appends the element at index `i` of list `a`.***
