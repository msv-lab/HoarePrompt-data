Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code only considers whether the input integer is even or odd, but it does not ensure that the modified rating changes are as close to `(a_i)/2` as possible. Additionally, the code does not handle the condition that the sum of all modified rating changes must be equal to 0. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet all the requirements specified in the problem description.
