Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The program does not guarantee that the modified rating changes are perfectly balanced. The sum of the modified ratings may not be equal to 0 in all cases. Additionally, the program does not ensure that the modified rating changes are as close to (a_i)/(2) as possible. There are cases where the program rounds up when it should round down, violating the requirements of the problem description.
