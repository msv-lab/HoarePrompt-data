You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered n participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant i is a_i. These rating changes are perfectly balanced — their sum is equal to 0.

Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared semi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.

There are two conditions though: 

  * For each participant i, their modified rating change b_i must be integer, and as close to (a_i)/(2) as possible. It means that either b_i = ⌊ (a_i)/(2) ⌋ or b_i = ⌈ (a_i)/(2) ⌉. In particular, if a_i is even, b_i = (a_i)/(2). Here ⌊ x ⌋ denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than x, and ⌈ x ⌉ denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than x. 
  * The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced — their sum must be equal to 0. 



Can you help with that?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 13 845), denoting the number of participants.

Each of the next n lines contains a single integer a_i (-336 ≤ a_i ≤ 1164), denoting the rating change of the i-th participant.

The sum of all a_i is equal to 0.

Output

Output n integers b_i, each denoting the modified rating change of the i-th participant in order of input.

For any i, it must be true that either b_i = ⌊ (a_i)/(2) ⌋ or b_i = ⌈ (a_i)/(2) ⌉. The sum of all b_i must be equal to 0.

If there are multiple solutions, print any. We can show that a solution exists for any valid input.

Examples

Input


3
10
-5
-5


Output


5
-2
-3


Input


7
-7
-29
0
3
24
-29
38


Output


-3
-15
0
2
12
-15
19

Note

In the first example, b_1 = 5, b_2 = -3 and b_3 = -2 is another correct solution.

In the second example there are 6 possible solutions, one of them is shown in the example output.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = []
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    a.append(x)
b = []
count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] % 2 == 0:
        b.append(a[i] / 2)
    if a[i] % 2 != 0:
        count = count + 1
        if count % 2 == 1:
            a[i] = a[i] / 2
            b.append(a[i])
        if count % 2 == 0:
            a[i] = a[i] / 2 + 1
            b.append(a[i])
print(b)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
