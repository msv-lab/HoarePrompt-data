Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly reads the input, calculates the modified rating changes according to the conditions provided in the problem description, and outputs the results. It handles both even and odd values of `a_i` appropriately by checking the remainder when divided by 2. The program ensures that the sum of all modified rating changes is equal to 0. Additionally, the program follows the rounding rules specified in the problem description. Since the program adheres to all the requirements and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
