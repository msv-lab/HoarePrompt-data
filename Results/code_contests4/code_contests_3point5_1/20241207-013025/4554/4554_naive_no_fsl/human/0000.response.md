Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the modified rating changes are perfectly balanced. The program only checks if the original rating change is even or odd and then divides it accordingly, but it does not guarantee that the sum of the modified rating changes will be equal to 0.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
8
-8
6
-6
```

The expected output should be:
```
4
-4
3
-3
```

But the program's output will be:
```
4.0
-4.0
3.0
-3.0
```

This shows that the program does not handle the case where the sum of the original ratings is 0 but the modified ratings are not perfectly balanced.
