Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` iterates over the string `s` and checks if there exists a substring of length 5 where all characters are '*', with a specific pattern of consecutive elements according to the value of `j`. However, the code does not consider the case where the consecutive elements should be the same. For example, in the input `11 .*.**.*.*.` the code will return "yes" even though the consecutive platforms are not the same. Thus, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
