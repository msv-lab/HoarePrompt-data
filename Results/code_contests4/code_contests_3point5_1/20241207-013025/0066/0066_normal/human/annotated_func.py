    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, if there exists a substring of length 5 in `s` consisting of consecutive elements with a distance of `j` between them and all elements are '*', the program returns True. Otherwise, the program does not return True.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length n consisting of characters '*' and '.'. The function iterates over the string `s` and checks if there exists a substring of length 5 where all characters are '*', with a specific pattern of consecutive elements according to the value of `j`. If such a substring is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The function only returns True in the specific case where the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is met.
