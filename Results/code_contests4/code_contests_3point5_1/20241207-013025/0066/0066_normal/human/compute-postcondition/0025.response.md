According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of string `s`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1**
