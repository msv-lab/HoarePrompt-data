According to the code, the loop will execute until `i` reaches the length of string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` and `i` are incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` and `i` are incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop**
