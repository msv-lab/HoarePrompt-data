According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `s`. If the condition is false, the loop executes one more time with `i` increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length n. To execute the loop one more time, the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') should be checked with the updated value of `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length n, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
