According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of the string `s` is not empty. Since the length of `s` is determined by `n`, as long as `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is between 2 and 100, and `s` is a non-empty string of length n.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length n**
