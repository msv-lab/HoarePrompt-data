The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length n consisting of characters '*' and '.'. The function returns True in multiple cases:

Case 1 to Case 7: Always return True.

Case 8: Returns True if the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is true after incrementing both 'i' and 'j' by 1.

Case 9: Returns True.

Case 10: Returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return True in multiple cases based on the conditions mentioned above.
