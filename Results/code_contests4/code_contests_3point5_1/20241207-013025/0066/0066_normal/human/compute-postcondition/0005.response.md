According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length n, the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be increased by 1**
