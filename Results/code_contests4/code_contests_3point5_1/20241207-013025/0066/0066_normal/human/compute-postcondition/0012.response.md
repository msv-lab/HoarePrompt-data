According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is less than len(s). At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, s is a non-empty string of length n. For the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length n, j is incremented by 1**
