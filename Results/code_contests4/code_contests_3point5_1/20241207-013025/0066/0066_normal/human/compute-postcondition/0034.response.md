Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` and `i` are incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop. If the condition i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*', then the function returns True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
