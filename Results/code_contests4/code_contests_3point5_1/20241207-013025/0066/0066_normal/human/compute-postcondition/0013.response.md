According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of string `s` is greater than 0. Since `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, it implies that `n` is greater than 0. Also, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`, so the index `i` needs to be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `i` is set to 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute**
