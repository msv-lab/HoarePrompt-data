According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, and the condition involving `j`. If the condition is false, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `i` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') needs to be evaluated again. This means that `i` needs to be increased by 1, and the values of `j` and `s` must be adjusted accordingly based on the condition. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time the condition involving `j` must be evaluated again**
