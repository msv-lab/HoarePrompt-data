According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than the length of string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should still be less than the length of string `s`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the length of string `s`.**
