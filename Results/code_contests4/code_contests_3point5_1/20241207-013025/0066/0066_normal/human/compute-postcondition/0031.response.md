Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` and `i` are incremented by 1. If the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is true after incrementing both `i` and `j` by 1, the program returns True. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
