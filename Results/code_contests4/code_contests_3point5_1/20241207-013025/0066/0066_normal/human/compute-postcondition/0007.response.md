Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length n. If the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is true, the program returns True. If the condition is false, the loop executes one more time and `i` is increased by 1.***
