According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `i` is 0. Since the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false, we need to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute. The condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false.**
