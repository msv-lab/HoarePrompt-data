Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `j` is incremented by 1. If there exists a substring of length 5 in `s` consisting of consecutive elements with a distance of `j` between them and all elements are '*', the program returns True. Otherwise, the program does not return True.**
