Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if there exists a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them in the given scheme of the level. It iterates through all possible starting platforms and intervals to find such a sequence. If a sequence is found, it returns True, indicating that the level is good. Otherwise, it returns False, indicating that the level is not good. The program covers all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description.
