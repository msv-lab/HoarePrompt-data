Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, then iterates through the string to check if there exists a sequence of five consecutive platforms with the same interval between them. If such a sequence is found, it returns True and prints 'yes', otherwise it returns False and prints 'no'. The logic of the program seems to align with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases as it checks for all possible combinations of platforms with the same interval. The program also handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description.
