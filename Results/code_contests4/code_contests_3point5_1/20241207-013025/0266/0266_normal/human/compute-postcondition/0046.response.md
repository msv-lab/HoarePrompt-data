According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the condition `dyn[j][first] > 0`. If `j` is less than 26 and `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, all elements in `dyn` have been updated, and if `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than 26 and the condition `dyn[j][first] > 0` must still hold true.
State: **All elements in `dyn` have been further updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 26 and `dyn[j][first]` must be greater than 0**
