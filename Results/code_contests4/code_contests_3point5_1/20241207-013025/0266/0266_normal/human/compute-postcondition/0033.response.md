Output State: **All elements in `dyn` have been updated. For each row `j` in `dyn` where `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, `dyn[j][last]` is updated to be equal to `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of string `s`. `n`, `__author__`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain unchanged. `i` is increased by 26 for the loop to execute again.**
