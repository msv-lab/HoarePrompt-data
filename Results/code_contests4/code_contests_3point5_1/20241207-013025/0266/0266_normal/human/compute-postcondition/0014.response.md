According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the values in the `dyn` list. If `j` is less than 25, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is between 0 and 25. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` should be less than 25. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 2D list of 0s with dimensions 26x26, `s` is the raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is the result of `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), for the loop to execute `j` is between 0 and 25, the value of `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, after the if statement executes, the value of `dyn[j][last]` is updated to the sum of the previous value of `dyn[j][first] and the length of `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` should be less than 25**
