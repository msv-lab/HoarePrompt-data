Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `n`, `__author__`, `dyn`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain the same. The elements in `dyn` have been updated. For the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be increased by 1. `s` is assigned the value of the raw input.**
