Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `n`, `__author__`, `dyn`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain the same. The elements in `dyn` have been updated based on the condition specified by taking the maximum value between the current value at `dyn[first][last]` and the length of string `s`.**
