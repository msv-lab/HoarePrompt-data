Example Answer:
`first` is assigned the value of the Unicode code of the first character of `s` minus the Unicode code of 'a'. The value of `s` is assigned from the raw input. Since the value of `s` is not provided, the exact value of `first` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 2D list of 0s with dimensions 26x26, `s` is assigned the value of the raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 2D list of 0s with dimensions 26x26, `s` is assigned the value of the raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`**
