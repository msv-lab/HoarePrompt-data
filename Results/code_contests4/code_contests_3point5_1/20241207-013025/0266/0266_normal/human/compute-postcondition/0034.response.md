Example Answer: 
For each row `j` in `dyn` where `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, the value of `dyn[j][last]` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `dyn[j][last]` and the length of string `s`. The value of `i` is increased by 26 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dyn` have been updated, `n`, `__author__`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain unchanged, and `i` is increased by 26.
Output State: **All elements in `dyn` have been updated, `n`, `__author__`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain unchanged, and `i` is increased by 26**
