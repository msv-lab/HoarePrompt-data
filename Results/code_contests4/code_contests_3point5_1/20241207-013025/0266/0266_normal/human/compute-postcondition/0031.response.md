Output State: `n`, `__author__`, `dyn`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain unchanged. Elements in `dyn` have been updated. `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` is 1 and `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0. The value of `dyn[j][last]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of string `s`.
