Example Answer:
A 2D list `dyn` is created with dimensions 26x26, where each element is initialized to 0. The initial state of variables `n` and `__author__` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a new input integer, `__author__` is 'Rikishi'; `dyn` is a 2D list of 0s with dimensions 26x26.
Output State: **`n` is a new input integer, `__author__` is 'Rikishi'; `dyn` is a 2D list of 0s with dimensions 26x26**
