According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 2D list of 0s with dimensions 26x26**
