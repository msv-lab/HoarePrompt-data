Output State: **All elements in `dyn` have been further updated. If for each `j` in the range from 0 to 25, `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0, then after the loop execution, all elements in `dyn` have been updated where `dyn[j][last]` is equal to `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of the input string `s`.**
