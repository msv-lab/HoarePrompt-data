Example Answer:
The value of `dyn[j][last]` is updated to be the value of `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of the input string `s`. The previous values of `dyn[j][last]` and `dyn[j][first]` are unknown, but after execution, `dyn[j][last]` will be equal to the sum of the previous value of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dyn` have been further updated.
Output State: **All elements in `dyn` have been further updated**
