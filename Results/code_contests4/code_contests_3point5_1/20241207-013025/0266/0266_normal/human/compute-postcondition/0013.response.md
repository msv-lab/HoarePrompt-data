Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 2D list of 0s with dimensions 26x26, `s` is the raw input, `first` is calculated based on the first character of `s`, `last` is the result of `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a'), for the loop to execute `j` is between 0 and 25, the value of `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0. After the if statement executes, the value of `dyn[j][last]` is updated to the sum of the previous value of `dyn[j][first] and the length of `s`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` should be less than 25.***
