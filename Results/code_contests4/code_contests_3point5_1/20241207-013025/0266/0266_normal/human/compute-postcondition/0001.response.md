Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial value of `n` is a positive integer, and after execution, `n` will hold the new input value. The value of `__author__` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a new input integer, `__author__` is 'Rikishi'**
