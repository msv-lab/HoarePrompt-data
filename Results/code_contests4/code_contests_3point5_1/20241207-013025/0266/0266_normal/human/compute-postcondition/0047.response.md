Example Answer:
The value of `dyn[j][last]` is updated to the sum of the previous value of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of string `s`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than 26 and `dyn[j][first]` is greater than 0. Other elements in `dyn` are further updated, so they are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **All elements in `dyn` have been further updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 26 and `dyn[j][first]` must be greater than 0. `dyn[j][last]` is updated to the sum of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of `s`.**
