The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input and then processes `n` sequences of lowercase letters. It calculates the maximum length of sequences that can be formed by concatenating sequences based on their first and last characters. Finally, it prints the maximum length of a sequence that can be formed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
