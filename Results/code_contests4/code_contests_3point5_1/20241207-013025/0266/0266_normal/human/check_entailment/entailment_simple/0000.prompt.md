You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.

In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.

The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings "ab" and "ba" is called "abba", and the dynasty, which had only the king "abca", is called "abca".

Vasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.

Note that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name A is earlier in the list than B, then if A and B were kings, then king A ruled before king B.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — the number of names in Vasya's list. Next n lines contain n abbreviated names, one per line. An abbreviated name is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed 10 characters.

Output

Print a single number — length of the sought dynasty's name in letters.

If Vasya's list is wrong and no dynasty can be found there, print a single number 0.

Examples

Input

3
abc
ca
cba


Output

6


Input

4
vvp
vvp
dam
vvp


Output

0


Input

3
ab
c
def


Output

1

Note

In the first sample two dynasties can exist: the one called "abcca" (with the first and second kings) and the one called "abccba" (with the first and third kings). 

In the second sample there aren't acceptable dynasties.

The only dynasty in the third sample consists of one king, his name is "c".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer. Each abbreviated name is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters with a length not exceeding 10 characters.**
def func():
    __author__ = 'Rikishi'
    n = int(raw_input())
    dyn = [([0] * 26) for i in range(26)]
    for i in range(n):
        s = raw_input()
        
        first = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')
        
        last = ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')
        
        for j in range(26):
            if dyn[j][first] > 0:
                dyn[j][last] = dyn[j][first] + len(s)
        
        dyn[first][last] = max(dyn[first][last], len(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `n`, `__author__`, `dyn`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain the same. The elements in `dyn` have been updated according to the conditions provided in the loop code, with each element representing the maximum value between the current value and the length of the string `s` for the corresponding indices.
    ans = max([dyn[i][i] for i in range(26)])
    print(ans)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
