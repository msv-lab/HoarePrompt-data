According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list with the value at index `a * 3600 + b * 60 + c` incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is less than `n+1`**
