Example Answer: 
The `max()` function is used to find the maximum value in the list `dp`. The output of the `max(dp)` will be the maximum value present in the list `dp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values after the last iteration of the loop, `dp` list is modified according to the calculations done in the loop, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0 and the maximum value present in the list `dp` is printed.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values after the last iteration of the loop, `dp` list is modified according to the calculations done in the loop, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0 and the maximum value present in the list `dp` is printed**
