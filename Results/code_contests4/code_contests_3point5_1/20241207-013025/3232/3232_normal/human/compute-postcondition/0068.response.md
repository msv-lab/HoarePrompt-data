Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, `dp[i + 1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, `n` is an input integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
