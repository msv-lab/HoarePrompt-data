Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The total number of seconds in a day stored in `m` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: The total number of seconds in a day is stored in `m`, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **The total number of seconds in a day is stored in `m`, `n` is an input integer**
