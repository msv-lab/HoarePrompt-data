According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than 0. Since `i` is `m - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `m`. Therefore, for the next iteration, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`.
State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values after the last iteration of the loop, `dp` list is modified according to the calculations done in the loop, `i` is less than `m`**
