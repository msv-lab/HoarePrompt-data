Since the loop condition is `while True`, the loop will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, all states remain the same at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers. The maximum value in the `dp` list is printed.**
