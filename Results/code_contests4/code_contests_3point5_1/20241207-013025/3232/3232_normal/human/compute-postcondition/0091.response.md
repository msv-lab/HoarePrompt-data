Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`, where `i` is equal to `m - 1`. Since `m` is greater than 0, the calculations are valid. Therefore, the output state is: `d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values after the last iteration of the loop, `dp` list is modified according to the calculations done in the loop, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, `m` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values after the last iteration of the loop, `dp` list is modified according to the calculations done in the loop, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, `m` is greater than 0**
