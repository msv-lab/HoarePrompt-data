Example Answer:
The value at index `d * 3600 + e * 60 + f` in the list `dp` is decremented by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list with the value at index `a * 3600 + b * 60 + c` incremented by 1**
