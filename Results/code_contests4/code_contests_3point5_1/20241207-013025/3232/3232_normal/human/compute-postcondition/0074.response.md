Example Answer:
The variables `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers. The values of `d`, `e`, and `f` are extracted from the last input split after converting them to integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers**
