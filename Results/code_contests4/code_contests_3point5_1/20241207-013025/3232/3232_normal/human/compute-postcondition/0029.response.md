Output State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is increased by the value of `dp[i]`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `m`**
