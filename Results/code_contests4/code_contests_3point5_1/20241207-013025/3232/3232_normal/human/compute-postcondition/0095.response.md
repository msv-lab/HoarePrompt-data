Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `dp[i]` added to itself. The value of `i` is less than `m+1`, and `dp` list is modified accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values, `dp` list is modified according to the calculation in the loop, `i` is less than `m+1`.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values, `dp` list is modified according to the calculation in the loop, `i` is less than `m+1`**
