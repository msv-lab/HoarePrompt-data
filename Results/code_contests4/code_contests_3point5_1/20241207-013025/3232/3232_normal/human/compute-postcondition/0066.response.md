Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will always execute. Therefore, all the states from the previous iteration will remain the same at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, and `dp[i + 1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the `dp` list**
