Example Answer:
The variables `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the raw input string `d` by ':'. The variables `d`, `e`, and `f` are now integers. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, a list `dp` is created with length `m + 1` filled with zeros, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integer values obtained by splitting the raw input string, `d`, `e`, and `f` are integer values obtained by splitting the raw input string**
