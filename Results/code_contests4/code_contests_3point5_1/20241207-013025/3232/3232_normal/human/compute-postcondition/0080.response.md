Example Answer:
`d` is split by ':' and converted to integers, assigning values to `d`, `e`, and `f`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned new integer values based on the split operation.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned new integer values based on the split operation**
