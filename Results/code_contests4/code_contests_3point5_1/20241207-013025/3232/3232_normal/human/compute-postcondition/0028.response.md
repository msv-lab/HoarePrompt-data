According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is the total number of seconds in a day. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, and `i` should still be less than `m`.
State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is increased by `dp[i]`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `m`**
