Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values after splitting `a` with ':' and converting them to integers. The previous values of `a` are known from the initial state, so `a` is split by ':' and converted to integers to get the values for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers, `dp` list is modified based on the calculation, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is increased by 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values after splitting `a` with ':' and converting them to integers, `d` is assigned the second value from the input after splitting by space.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers, `dp` list is modified based on the calculation, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is increased by 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values after splitting `a` with ':' and converting them to integers, `d` is assigned the second value from the input after splitting by space**
