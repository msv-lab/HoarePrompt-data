Example Answer:
The value of `d`, `e`, and `f` are used to calculate an index in the `dp` list. The value at that index is decremented by 1. The previous values of `d`, `e`, and `f` are used to calculate the index, and `dp` list is modified accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers, `dp` list is modified based on the calculation.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers, `dp` list is modified based on the calculation**
