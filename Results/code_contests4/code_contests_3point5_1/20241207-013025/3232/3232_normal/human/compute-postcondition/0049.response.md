Example Answer:
The value of `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are obtained from the input split after converting them to integers. The `dp` list is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, `a` is assigned the integer value of the hour component after splitting `a`, `b` and `c` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned appropriate values, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers.
Output State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, `a` is assigned the integer value of the hour component after splitting `a`, `b` and `c` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned appropriate values, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers.**
