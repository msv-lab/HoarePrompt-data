According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values, `dp` list is modified according to the calculation in the loop, `i` is less than `m+1`**
