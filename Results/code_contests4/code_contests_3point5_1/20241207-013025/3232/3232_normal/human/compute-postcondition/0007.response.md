According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer, and a list `dp` is created with length `m + 1` filled with zeros. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, a list `dp` is created with length `m + 1` filled with zeros**
