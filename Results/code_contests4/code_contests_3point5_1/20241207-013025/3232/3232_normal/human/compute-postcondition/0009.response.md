Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the string `a` with colon ':' delimiter. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, so the Output State is: `m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, a list `dp` is created with length `m + 1` filled with zeros, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integer values obtained by splitting the raw input string.
Output State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, a list `dp` is created with length `m + 1` filled with zeros, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integer values obtained by splitting the raw input string**
