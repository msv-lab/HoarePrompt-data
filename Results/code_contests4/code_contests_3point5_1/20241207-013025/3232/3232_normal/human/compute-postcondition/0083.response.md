According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned new integer values based on the split operation and `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is incremented by 1. Since `_` is used as the loop variable, it will be increased by 1 for the next iteration, so `_` needs to be adjusted accordingly. 
State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned new integer values based on the split operation, `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `_` must be less than `n`**
