Example Answer:
The `print(max(dp))` statement prints the maximum value in the `dp` list. Since the value of `dp[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, the maximum value of `dp` is already stored in `dp[i + 1]`. Therefore, the maximum value in the `dp` list is already calculated and printed. 
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp[i + 1]` is the sum of all elements in the `dp` list, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, and `dp[i + 1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the `dp` list**
