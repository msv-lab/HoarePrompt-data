Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the first value from the input split after converting it to an integer using `map` and `int`, `b` is assigned the second value from the input split after converting it to an integer using `map` and `int`, `c` is assigned the third value from the input split after converting it to an integer using `map` and `int`. The total number of seconds in a day is represented by `m`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `dp` is a list with the value at index `a * 3600 + b * 60 + c` incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list with the value at index `a * 3600 + b * 60 + c` incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers.**
