According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values after splitting `d` with ':' and converting them to integers, `dp` list is modified based on the calculation. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` needs to be increased by 1.
