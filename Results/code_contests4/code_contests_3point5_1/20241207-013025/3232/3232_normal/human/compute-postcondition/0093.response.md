Example Answer:
The value at index `i + 1` in the `dp` list is incremented by the value at index `i`. The values of variables `d`, `e`, and `f` remain the same as they are not involved in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values, `dp` list is modified according to the calculation in the loop, `i` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`d`, `e`, and `f` have new integer values, `dp` list is modified according to the calculation in the loop, `i` is less than `m`**
