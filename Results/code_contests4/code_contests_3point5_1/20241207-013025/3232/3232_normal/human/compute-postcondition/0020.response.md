Output State: `m` is the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list with the value at index `a * 3600 + b * 60 + c` incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned values from the input split after converting them to integers.
