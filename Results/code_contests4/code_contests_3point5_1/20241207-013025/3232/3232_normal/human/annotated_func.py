#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of trains in the timetable. Each train's departure and arrival times are given in the format hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The range of each value is 0 ≤ hh < 24, 0 ≤ mm < 60, 0 ≤ ss < 60.**
def func():
    m = 24 * 60 * 60
    while True:
        n = int(raw_input())
        
        if n == 0:
            break
        
        dp = [0] * (m + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, d = raw_input().split()
            a, b, c = map(int, a.split(':'))
            d, e, f = map(int, d.split(':'))
            dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c] += 1
            dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f] -= 1
        
        for i in range(m):
            dp[i + 1] += dp[i]
        
        print(max(dp))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop has executed, `m` remains unchanged as the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is 0, `dp` list is modified throughout the iterations, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` variables are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, and the maximum value in the `dp` list is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads and processes timetable data for trains. It accepts user input for the number of trains, then reads the departure and arrival times for each train. It calculates the maximum number of trains present at any given time based on the timetable data and prints this value. The function does not return any specific value, but it handles the timetable data as described. However, there is a missing edge case handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric inputs) and the code does not explicitly handle such cases.
