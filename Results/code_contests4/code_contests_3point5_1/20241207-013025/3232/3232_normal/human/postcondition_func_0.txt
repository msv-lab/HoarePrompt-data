The function `func` reads and processes timetable data for trains. It accepts user input for the number of trains, then reads the departure and arrival times for each train. It calculates the maximum number of trains present at any given time based on the timetable data and prints this value. The function does not return any specific value, but it handles the timetable data as described. However, there is a missing edge case handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric inputs) and the code does not explicitly handle such cases.
