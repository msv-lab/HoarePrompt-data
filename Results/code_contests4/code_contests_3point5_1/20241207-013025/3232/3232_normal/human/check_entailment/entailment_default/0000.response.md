Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input for the number of trains, then reads the departure and arrival times for each train at Osaki Station. It calculates the maximum number of trains present at any given time based on the timetable data and prints this value. The approach of using the dp array to track the number of trains at each time slot is correct. The code correctly handles the circular nature of the Yamanote Line by incrementing and decrementing the values in the dp array based on train arrivals and departures. Additionally, the code terminates correctly when n = 0, as specified in the problem description. Overall, the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
