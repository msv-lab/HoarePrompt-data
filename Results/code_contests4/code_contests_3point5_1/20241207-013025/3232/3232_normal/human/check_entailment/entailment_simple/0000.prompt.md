You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Osaki

Osaki

English text is not available in this practice contest.

The Yamanote Line is a circular railway line laid in the 23 wards of Tokyo. The total route distance is 34.5km, and one lap takes about one hour. There are 29 stations in total. The line color is Uguisu color. The peak congestion rate exceeds 200%, making it one of the busiest railway lines in Japan. One train runs every three minutes during the busiest hours, and people who come to Tokyo for the first time are amazed at the sight.

Mr. Tetsuko loves the Yamanote Line and loves genuine railways. One day, she came up with the following question while reading her favorite book, the JR timetable. "How many vehicles are used a day on the Yamanote Line?"

She tried to figure out the minimum number of vehicles required for operation from the timetable. However, the number of trains was so large that she couldn't count it by herself. So she turned to you, a good programmer, for help.

Your job is to write a program to find the minimum number of cars required to operate the Yamanote Line from a given timetable. Since the Yamanote Line is a circular line, the timetable is often written with "Osaki Station" as the starting and ending stations for convenience. Therefore, only the departure and arrival times of each train at Osaki Station are recorded in the timetable given by her.

Although this cannot happen on the actual Yamanote Line, in order to simplify the situation setting, we will consider that the train can depart from Osaki Station immediately after it arrives at Osaki Station. In addition, there are cases where the time taken by Mr. Tetsuko is incorrect, or the train added by Mr. Tetsuko's delusion is mixed in the timetable, but you can not see them, so to the last The number must be calculated for the time as written.

If you write a program that works, she may invite you to a date on the train. However, it is up to you to accept or decline the invitation.

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset has the following format.

> n
> hh: mm: ss hh: mm: ss
> hh: mm: ss hh: mm: ss
> ...
> hh: mm: ss hh: mm: ss

The integer n in the first line is the number of trains included in the timetable. This value is guaranteed not to exceed 10,000. The departure time and arrival time of each train at Osaki Station are given in this order on the n lines from the 2nd line to the n + 1st line, and the departure time and arrival time are separated by a single space. Each time is expressed in the format hh: mm: ss, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The range of each value is 0 ≤ hh <24, 0 ≤ mm <60, 0 ≤ ss <60. All of these numbers are prefixed with 0s as needed to be two digits.

Trains that run across 24:00 at night are not included. Therefore, the departure time is always before the arrival time.

The end of input is indicated by n = 0. It is not included in the dataset.

Output

For each dataset, output the minimum number of vehicles required on one line.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of trains in the timetable. Each train's departure and arrival times are given in the format hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The range of each value is 0 ≤ hh < 24, 0 ≤ mm < 60, 0 ≤ ss < 60.**
def func():
    m = 24 * 60 * 60
    while True:
        n = int(raw_input())
        
        if n == 0:
            break
        
        dp = [0] * (m + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, d = raw_input().split()
            a, b, c = map(int, a.split(':'))
            d, e, f = map(int, d.split(':'))
            dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c] += 1
            dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f] -= 1
        
        for i in range(m):
            dp[i + 1] += dp[i]
        
        print(max(dp))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop has executed, `m` remains unchanged as the total number of seconds in a day, `n` is 0, `dp` list is modified throughout the iterations, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` variables are assigned values from the last input split after converting them to integers, and the maximum value in the `dp` list is printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
