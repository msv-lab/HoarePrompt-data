Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It takes the input of the number of trains and their departure and arrival times at Osaki Station. It then calculates the minimum number of vehicles required for operation based on the timetable provided. The program uses a list `dp` to keep track of the number of trains at each second of the day and updates it accordingly. Finally, it prints the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the minimum number of vehicles required.

The program handles multiple datasets correctly and terminates when `n` is 0. The input constraints and format are adhered to as well. Therefore, the program is correct and provides the expected output for the given problem description.
