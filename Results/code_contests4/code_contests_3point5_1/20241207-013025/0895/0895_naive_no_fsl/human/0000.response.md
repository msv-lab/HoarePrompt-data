Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input of the start and end time of the contest, calculates the midpoint, and formats the output in the required hh:mm format. It ensures that the contest lasts an even number of minutes and that it lasts at least two minutes. Additionally, it handles cases where the hour or minute values might need a leading zero in the output format. The program logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
