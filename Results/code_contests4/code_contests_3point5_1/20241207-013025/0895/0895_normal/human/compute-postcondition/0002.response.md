Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input values split by ':' into integers and assigns them to the variable `a`. The values of `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, and `c` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, and the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':'.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, and the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':'**
