Postcondition: ***`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':', `c` is half of the total minutes calculated from the input hours and minutes, `d` contains the string representation of the tuple obtained by dividing `c` by 60, and if the length of the first element in `d` is 1, then `d[0]` has an additional '0' at the beginning. Additionally, after entering the if statement, the length of the second element in `d` is 1***
