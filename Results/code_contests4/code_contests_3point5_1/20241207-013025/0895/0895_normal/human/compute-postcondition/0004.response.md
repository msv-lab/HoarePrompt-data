The variable `c` is divided by 2. Since the initial state specifies that the contest lasts at least two minutes and `c` represents the total minutes calculated from the input hours and minutes, dividing `c` by 2 would effectively cut the total duration of the contest in half. 
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':', `c` is half of the total minutes calculated from the input hours and minutes**
