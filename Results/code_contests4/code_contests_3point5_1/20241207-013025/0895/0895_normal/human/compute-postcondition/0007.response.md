Example Answer:
`d[0]` is assigned the value `'0' + d[0]`. Since the initial state of `d[0]` is a string obtained from `c` divided by 60, the value of `d[0]` will have an additional '0' at the beginning. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: *`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':', `c` is half of the total minutes calculated from the input hours and minutes, `d` contains the string representation of the tuple obtained by dividing `c` by 60, and the length of the first element in `d` is 1, `d[0]` has an additional '0' at the beginning.
