Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`. Given that `a` is a map object containing integer values split by ':', we can assume that `a[0]` represents the hours and `a[1]` represents the minutes. Since the contest lasts at least two minutes, the value of `c` will be a valid total number of minutes. 
Output State: **h_1, m_1, h_2, m_2 are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, and the contest lasts at least two minutes; a is a map object containing the integer values from the input split by ':', c is the total number of minutes calculated from the input values**
