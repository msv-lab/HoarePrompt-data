Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`. The values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are taken from the input split by ':', so `a[0]` contains the hours and `a[1]` contains the minutes. The calculation `a[0] * 60 + a[1]` converts the hours to minutes and adds the minutes to get the total minutes. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, and the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':', and `c` is the total minutes calculated from the input hours and minutes.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':', `c` is the total minutes calculated from the input hours and minutes**
