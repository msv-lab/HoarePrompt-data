The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the duration of a contest based on the start time (h_1, m_1) and end time (h_2, m_2) provided. The parameters h_1, m_1, h_2, m_2 are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2, and the contest lasts at least two minutes.

Functionality: **The function calculates the duration of a contest based on the start time (h_1, m_1) and end time (h_2, m_2) provided. The contest duration is calculated under the constraints that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2, and the contest lasts at least two minutes.**
