Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the start time (h_1, m_1) and end time (h_2, m_2) of a contest as input. 
- It calculates the total duration of the contest in minutes and divides it by 2 to find the midpoint.
- The code then converts this duration into hours and minutes format and ensures the output is in the correct hh:mm format.
- The constraints for the input times are satisfied: 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, and m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2.
- The code handles the case when the contest lasts at least two minutes as required by the problem description.

Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and all potential cases seem to be covered correctly, the correctness of the code is **True**.
