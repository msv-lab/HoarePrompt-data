You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp is going to participate in the contest. It starts at h_1:m_1 and ends at h_2:m_2. It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, where x \% y is x modulo y). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.

Polycarp wants to know the time of the midpoint of the contest. For example, if the contest lasts from 10:00 to 11:00 then the answer is 10:30, if the contest lasts from 11:10 to 11:12 then the answer is 11:11.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers h_1 and m_1 in the format hh:mm.

The second line of the input contains two integers h_2 and m_2 in the same format (hh:mm).

It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59.

It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, where x \% y is x modulo y). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.

Output

Print two integers h_3 and m_3 (0 ≤ h_3 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_3 ≤ 59) corresponding to the midpoint of the contest in the format hh:mm. Print each number as exactly two digits (prepend a number with leading zero if needed), separate them with ':'.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h_1, m_1, h_2, m_2 are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, and the contest lasts at least two minutes.**
def func():
    a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))
    c = a[0] * 60 + a[1]
    a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))
    c += a[0] * 60 + a[1]
    c /= 2
    d = map(str, divmod(c, 60))
    if (len(d[0]) == 1) :
        d[0] = '0' + d[0]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, the contest lasts at least two minutes; `a` contains the integer values from the input split by ':', `c` is half of the total minutes calculated from the input hours and minutes, `d` contains the string representation of the tuple obtained by dividing `c` by 60, and if the length of the first element in `d` is 1, then `d[0]` has an additional '0' at the beginning.
    if (len(d[1]) == 1) :
        d[1] = '0' + d[1]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, `a`, `c`, `d` are integers and strings. If the length of `d[1]` is 1, then `d[1]` contains a string with an additional '0' at the beginning. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
