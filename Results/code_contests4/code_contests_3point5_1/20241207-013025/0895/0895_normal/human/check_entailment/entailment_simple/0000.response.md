Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes input for the starting and ending times of the contest, calculates the total minutes of the contest, finds the midpoint, and then formats the midpoint time in the required hh:mm format.

The program ensures that the contest lasts an even number of minutes and that it lasts at least two minutes, as specified in the problem description. It also handles cases where the hour or minute part of the midpoint time is a single digit by adding a leading '0' if needed.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid input cases.
