Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the midpoint of the contest as described in the problem description. It takes the start and end times of the contest, calculates the total duration in minutes, divides it by 2 to find the midpoint, and then converts it back to hours and minutes format.

The annotations in the program confirm that the input constraints are met (0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2), and that the contest lasts at least two minutes.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
