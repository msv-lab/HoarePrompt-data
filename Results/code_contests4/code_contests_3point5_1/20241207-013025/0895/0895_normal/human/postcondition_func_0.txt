The function takes the start time (h_1, m_1) and end time (h_2, m_2) of a contest as input. It calculates the total duration of the contest in minutes and divides it by 2. The function then converts this duration into hours and minutes format. The constraints for the input times are 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, and m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2. The contest duration must be at least two minutes.
