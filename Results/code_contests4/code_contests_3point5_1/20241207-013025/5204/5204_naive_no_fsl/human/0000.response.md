Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses as described in the problem statement. The formula used in the program is incorrect. 

For example, if the input is:
```
199
60
40
```
The expected output should be approximately 119.4, but the program will output 60. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the correctness should be False.
