Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The values of `l` and `q` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `p`, `q` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000 and 1 <= `p`, `q` <= 500.
Output State: **`l`, `p`, `q` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000 and 1 <= `p`, `q` <= 500**
