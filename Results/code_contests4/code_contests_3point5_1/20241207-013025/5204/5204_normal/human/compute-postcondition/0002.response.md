Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `input()`. The value of `q` is now determined by the input provided. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `p`, `q` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000, 1 <= `p`, `q` <= 500, `q` is determined by the input.
Output State: **`l`, `p`, `q` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000, 1 <= `p`, `q` <= 500, `q` is determined by the input**
