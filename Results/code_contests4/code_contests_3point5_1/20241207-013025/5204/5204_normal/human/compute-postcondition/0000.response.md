Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `l` can vary based on the input provided, within the specified constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `p`, `q` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000 and 1 <= `p`, `q` <= 500.
Output State: **`l`, `p`, `q` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000 and 1 <= `p`, `q` <= 500**
