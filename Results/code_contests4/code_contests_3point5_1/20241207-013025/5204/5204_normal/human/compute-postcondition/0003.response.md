Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of dividing the float value of `l` by the sum of `p` and `q`, then multiplying the result by `p`. The value of `q` is determined by the input and can be any value between 1 and 500. Therefore, the output state is: `l`, `p` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000, 1 <= `p` <= 500, `q` is determined by the input.
Output State: **`l`, `p` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= 1000, 1 <= `p` <= 500, `q` is determined by the input**
