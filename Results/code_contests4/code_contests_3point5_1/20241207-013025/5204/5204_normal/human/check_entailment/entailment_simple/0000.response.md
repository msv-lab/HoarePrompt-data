Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program calculates the distance from Harry to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses using the formula `(l / (p + q)) * p`, which is incorrect.

The correct formula to calculate the distance from Harry to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses should be `(l * p) / (p + q)`, as the impulses will meet at a distance proportionate to the speeds of the impulses.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
