Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The formula used in the program to calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses is incorrect. The correct formula should be `l / (p + q) * p` according to the problem description, but in the program, the multiplication operation is outside the print statement, causing a syntax error.

Additionally, the program does not enforce the constraints on the values of `l`, `p`, and `q`, which are specified in the problem description. This could lead to unexpected inputs and incorrect outputs in some cases.
