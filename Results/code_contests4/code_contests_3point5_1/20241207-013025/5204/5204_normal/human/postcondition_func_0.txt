The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `l`, `p`, and `q`. It then calculates a value based on these inputs but does not return any value. However, there is a syntax error in the code where the multiplication operation is outside the print statement, which may cause unexpected behavior. Additionally, the annotations mention specific constraints on the values of `l`, `p`, and `q`, but the code does not enforce these constraints, potentially leading to unexpected inputs.
