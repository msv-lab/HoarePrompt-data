Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses. The formula used in the program is incorrect.

For example, if we consider the following input:
Input
```
100
50
50
```
The expected output should be 50, as the speeds of the impulses are equal and the meeting occurs exactly in the middle of the corridor. However, the provided program will output 2500. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and is incorrect.
