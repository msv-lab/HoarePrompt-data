Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `n_moves`. If `n_moves` is less than 0, the loop will continue executing with updated values. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described. `n_moves` is calculated as the difference between `i2` and `i1`. If `n_moves` < 0, then the loop continues executing with updated values, otherwise, no changes are made.**
