Example Answer:
`start_m[val]` is updated with the value of `index`. The value of `val` is the last element in the `start` list, `index` is the index of the last element iterated. Therefore, after execution, `start_m[val]` is updated with the new value of `index`. Other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with `val` as the key and `index` as the value, `index` is the index of the last element iterated, `val` is the last element in the `start` list, `start_m[val]` is updated with the new value of `index`**
