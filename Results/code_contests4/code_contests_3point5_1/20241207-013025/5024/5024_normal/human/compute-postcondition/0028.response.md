Example Answer:
`i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`, where `v1` is a key. The value of `end_m` must contain more key-value pairs for the loop to execute another time. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time, `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs.
Output State: **`n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time, `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs**
