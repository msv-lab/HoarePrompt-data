According to the code, the loop can execute if the `start_m` dictionary has at least 1 key-value pair. Before the loop starts, the `start_m` dictionary already has elements. So, to ensure the loop executes, we need to specify that `start_m` has at least 1 key-value pair.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with all elements in `start` as keys and their corresponding indices as values, `end_m` is a dictionary with the value of `val` from `end` list as key and `index` as its value, `index` is equal to the index of the last element in `end`, `val` is the last element in the `end` list, `res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `start_m` has at least 1 key-value pair**
