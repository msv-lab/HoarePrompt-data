According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `start` list. If the list has more elements that have not been iterated over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` has been partially iterated over, `index` is the index of the last element iterated, `val` is the last element iterated. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements in the `start` list that have not been iterated over. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with `val` as the key and `index` as the value, `index` is the index of the last element iterated, `val` is the last element in the `start` list**
