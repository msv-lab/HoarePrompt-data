Example Answer:
`n_moves` is assigned the value of `n - i1`, where `n` and `i1` are defined variables. The value of `n_moves` is calculated as the difference between `n` and `i1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, `n_moves` is calculated as the difference between `i2` and `i1`.
Output State: **`n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, `n_moves` is calculated as the difference between `i2` and `i1`**
