Example Answer:
`end_m[val]` is assigned the value `index`, where `index` is 2. The value of `val` is the third element in the `end` list. The initial state of the variables is as follows: `n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers with at least 3 elements, `start_m` is a dictionary with all elements in `start` as keys and their corresponding indices as values, `end_m` is a dictionary with the value of `val` from `end` list as key and `index` as its value, `index` is 2. After assignment, the value of `end_m[val]` is updated to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers with at least 3 elements, `start_m` is a dictionary with all elements in `start` as keys and their corresponding indices as values, `end_m` is a dictionary with the value of `val` from `end` list as key and `index` as its value, `index` is 2, `end_m[val]` is 2**
