Example Answer:
`start_m[val]` is assigned the value of `index`, where `val` is the next element in the `start` list and `index` is the index of the next element to be iterated. The previous values of `val` and `index` are unknown, but `val` is taken from the `start` list and `index` is the index of the next element. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with `val` as the key and `index` as the value, `index` is the index of the next element to be iterated, `val` is the next element in the `start` list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with `val` as the key and `index` as the value, `index` is the index of the next element to be iterated, `val` is the next element in the `start` list**
