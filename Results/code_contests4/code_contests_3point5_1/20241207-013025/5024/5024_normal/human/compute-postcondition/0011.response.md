Example Answer:
`end_m` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with all elements in `start` as keys and their corresponding indices as values, `end_m` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with all elements in `start` as keys and their corresponding indices as values, `end_m` is an empty dictionary**
