Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from standard input and two lists of integers `start` and `end`. It then constructs dictionaries `start_m` and `end_m` mapping values to their indices. The function calculates the maximum number of moves required to reach from the starting position to the ending position in the lists, considering wrapping around if needed, and prints the result. The function does not have a return statement and relies on global variables for its operation. The code does not handle cases where the input constraints are violated or if there are missing input values. **
