Example Answer:
The value of `n_moves` is calculated as the difference between `i2` and `i1`. The values of `i1` and `i2` are not defined in the initial state, so the output state is: `n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs, and the value of `n_moves` is calculated as the difference between `i2` and `i1`.
Output State: **`n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs, and `n_moves` is calculated as the difference between `i2` and `i1`**
