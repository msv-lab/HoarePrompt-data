Example Answer:
`i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`. The value of `v1` and `end_m` are not given, so the specific value of `i2` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs.
Output State: **`n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs**.
