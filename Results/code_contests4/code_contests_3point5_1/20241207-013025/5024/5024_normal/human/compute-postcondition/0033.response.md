According to the code, the loop can execute again if `start_m` contains more key-value pairs. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are defined as described. If `n_moves` is less than 0, it is the result of `n - i1`. After execution, `res` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `n_moves`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs.
State: **`n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs**
