Example Answer:
`start_m` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variables `n`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers, `start_m` is an empty dictionary**
