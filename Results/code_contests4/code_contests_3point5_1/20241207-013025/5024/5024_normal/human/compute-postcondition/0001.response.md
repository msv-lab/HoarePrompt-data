Example Answer:
`start` is assigned a list of integers converted from the input obtained from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. Since `n` is an input integer, after execution, `start` will be a list containing the input integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers**
