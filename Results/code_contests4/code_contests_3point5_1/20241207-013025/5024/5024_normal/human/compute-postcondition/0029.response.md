Example Answer:
`n_moves` is assigned the value of `i2 - i1`. The values of `i2` and `i1` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time, `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs.
Output State: **`n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time, `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs**
