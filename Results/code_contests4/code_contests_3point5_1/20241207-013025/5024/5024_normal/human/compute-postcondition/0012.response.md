According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `end` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `end_m` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed, the `end` list must have at least 1 element, the `index` is 0, and `val` is the first element in the `end` list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers created by converting input from standard input into integers with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with all elements in `start` as keys and their corresponding indices as values, `end_m` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `end` list has at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `val` is the first element in the `end` list**.
