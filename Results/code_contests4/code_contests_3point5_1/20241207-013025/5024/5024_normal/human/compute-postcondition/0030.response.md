Example Answer:
`n_moves` is assigned the value of `n - i1`. The values of `n` and `i1` are known, so the value of `n_moves` can be calculated based on those values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `start`, `end`, `start_m`, `end_m`, `res`, `i2`, `n_moves` are all defined as described, for the loop to execute another time, `start_m` must contain more key-value pairs; `n_moves` is the result of `n - i1`.
