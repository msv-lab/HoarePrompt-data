The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the global variable `n`, which is an integer satisfying the constraints 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. The function returns nothing, as it does not have a return statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to perform operations based on the global variable `n` within the specified constraints.
