Correctness: **True**

The code correctly solves the given problem statement. It reads the input integers `n`, `start`, and `end` as described. Then, it constructs dictionaries `start_m` and `end_m` to map values to their indices. The code calculates the maximum number of moves required to reach from the starting position to the ending position in the lists, considering wrapping around if needed, and prints the result. 

The code handles all cases where the first permutation needs to be converted to the second permutation by moving elements from the end to the beginning or between consecutive elements. The logic of finding the maximum number of moves by comparing indices in the dictionaries `start_m` and `end_m` correctly considers the cases where wrapping around is required. 

The output hints also support this by describing the functionality of the code accurately. The code does not violate any of the problem constraints and provides the correct output for all given examples. Hence, the code is correct.
