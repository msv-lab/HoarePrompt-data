Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem description. It reads the input values, constructs dictionaries to map values to their indices, calculates the maximum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second, and prints the result. The algorithm handles the case where the last number in the permutation needs to be moved to the beginning or inserted between elements. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
