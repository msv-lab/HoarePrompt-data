Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second permutation by keeping track of the positions of each number in the two permutations and calculating the number of moves needed to move each number to its correct position. The program handles all potential cases, including moving a number to the beginning of the permutation or inserting it between two consecutive numbers. The logic and implementation are correct, and the program outputs the correct result for the provided examples.
