Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly reads the input of two permutations, creates dictionaries to store the index of each number in the permutations, and then calculates the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second. The logic of finding the number of moves required by comparing the indices in the two permutations is correct and will work for all possible inputs. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
