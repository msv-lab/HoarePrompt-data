Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It does not correctly calculate the number of ways to place the benches in the park as described in the problem statement. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not follow the requirements of the problem description.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves using combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to place the benches. The correct solution should involve calculating the combination of choosing 5 paths out of the total number of paths (n * n) in the park. The formula for calculating combinations can be used to determine the number of ways to place the benches.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct solution to the problem.
