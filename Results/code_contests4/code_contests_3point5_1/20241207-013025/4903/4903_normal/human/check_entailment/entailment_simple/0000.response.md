Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program calculates the factorial of `n` and the product of numbers from 1 to `n`, but it does not account for the requirement that each bench should be placed on a cross of paths and each path should contain not more than one bench.

The program simply returns the factorial of `n` divided by the product of numbers from 1 to `n`, which does not correspond to the number of ways to place the benches as described in the problem.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
