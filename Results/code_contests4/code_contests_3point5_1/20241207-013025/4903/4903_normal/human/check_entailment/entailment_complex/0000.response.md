Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program calculates the factorial of 'n' and then divides it by the product of numbers from 1 to 'n'. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to place the benches.

The correct approach to solving the problem involves calculating the number of ways to select 5 paths out of the total n paths in both directions (east to west and north to south). This can be done using the combination formula. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and provides the incorrect output.
