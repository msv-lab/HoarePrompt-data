Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 5, as the input condition specified `n` should be between 5 and 100. The code does not account for this edge case, so it is incorrect.

Additionally, the output hints do not provide any specific examples or cases that the code may not handle, so they do not help in confirming the correctness of the code. The output hints only describe the functionality of the `func_1` function, which does not cover all the potential cases where the code might fail to meet the problem description.
