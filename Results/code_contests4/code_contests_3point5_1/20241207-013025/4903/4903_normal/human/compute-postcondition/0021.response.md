The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100. After executing the function body, the program returns the factorial of `n` divided by the product of numbers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range, calculate the factorial of `n`, and then divide it by the product of numbers from 1 to `n`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`, where `n` is an integer within the range of 5 to 100. It calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the result divided by the product of numbers from 1 to `n`.**
