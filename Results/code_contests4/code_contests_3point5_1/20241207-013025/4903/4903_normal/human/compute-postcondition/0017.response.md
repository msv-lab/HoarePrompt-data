Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `s` multiplied by `g`. The value of `s` is unknown, but the value of `g` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be the previous value of `s` multiplied by the incremented value of `g`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is the product of `n` and `n-1` multiplied by `n-2`, `s` is the product of `s` and `g`, `p` is `n` - 3, `g` is incremented by 2, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is 2, and `s` is updated after multiplying by `g`.**
