Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `s * g`, where `s` is the product of `s` and `g`. The value of `g` has been incremented by 1, and the previous values of `s` and `g` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is the product of `n` and `n-1`, `s` is the product of `s` and `g`, `p` is `n` - 2, `g` is incremented by 1, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is the product of `n` and `n-1`, `s` is the product of `s` and `g`, `p` is `n` - 2, `g` is incremented by 1, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1**
