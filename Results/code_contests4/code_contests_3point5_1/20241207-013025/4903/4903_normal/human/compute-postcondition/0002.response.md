Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned the value of `n`, where `n` is an integer between 5 and 100. Since `n` is already defined within the specified range, `p` takes on the value of `n`. The values of `r` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is 1, `s` is 1, `p` is assigned the value of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is 1, `s` is 1, `p` is assigned the value of `n`**
