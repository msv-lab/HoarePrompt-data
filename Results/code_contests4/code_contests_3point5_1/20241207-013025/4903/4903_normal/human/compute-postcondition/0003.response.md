Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is 1, `s` is 1, `p` is assigned the value of `n`, `g` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is 1, `s` is 1, `p` is assigned the value of `n`, `g` is 1**
