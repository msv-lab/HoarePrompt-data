Example Answer:
`r` is assigned the value `1`, and `s` is assigned the value `1`. Since there are no operations involving `n`, the value of `n` remains within the range 5 to 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100; `r` is 1; `s` is 1**
