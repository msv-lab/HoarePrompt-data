Example Answer:
`r` is multiplied by the value of `p`, and since `p` is equal to `n`, `r` is multiplied by `n`. The value of `r` is 1, so after execution, `r` becomes equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `p` is assigned the value of `n`, `g` is 1, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is equal to `n`, `s` is 1, `p` is assigned the value of `n`, `g` is 1, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
