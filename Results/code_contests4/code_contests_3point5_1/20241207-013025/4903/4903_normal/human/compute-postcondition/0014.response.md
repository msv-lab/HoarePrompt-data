According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `i`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is the product of `n` and `n-1`, `s` is the product of `s` and `g`, `p` is `n` - 2, `g` is incremented by 2, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 100, `r` is the product of `n` and `n-1`, `s` is the product of `s` and `g`, `p` is `n` - 2, `g` is incremented by 2, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is 2**
