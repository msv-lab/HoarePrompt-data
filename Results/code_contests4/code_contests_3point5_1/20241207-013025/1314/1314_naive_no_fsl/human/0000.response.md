Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values and constructs the graph based on the provided edges.
2. It then checks if the degree of the first vertex is less than D, and if so, it prints "NO" and exits.
3. It then proceeds to assign components to vertices and ensures that the number of components is less than or equal to D.
4. It then constructs a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D and prints the edges accordingly.
5. The program handles the case where there are multiple possible answers by choosing any valid spanning tree.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output based on the given input.
