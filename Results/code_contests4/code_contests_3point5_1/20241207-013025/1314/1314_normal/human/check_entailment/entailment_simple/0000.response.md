Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description as follows:
1. It reads the input and constructs a graph representation using dictionaries.
2. It checks if the degree of the first vertex is less than the required degree D, if so, it prints "NO" and exits.
3. It then performs a traversal to find a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D.
4. If such a spanning tree is found, it prints "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree.
5. The program ensures that the printed spanning tree is a subset of the input edges and that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D.

The program handles all possible cases and always produces the correct output as per the problem description.
