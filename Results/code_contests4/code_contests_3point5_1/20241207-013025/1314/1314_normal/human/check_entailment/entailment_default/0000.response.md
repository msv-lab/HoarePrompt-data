Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values and forms relationships between elements based on the edges provided in the input.
- It then performs a series of operations to find a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D.
- The code ensures that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D by checking specific conditions and printing outputs accordingly.
- The code outputs "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree if such a tree exists, otherwise it outputs "NO".
- The code seems to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality by describing the process of finding a spanning tree with the specified degree for the first vertex.
- Without finding a specific case where the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, it can be concluded that the code is correct.
