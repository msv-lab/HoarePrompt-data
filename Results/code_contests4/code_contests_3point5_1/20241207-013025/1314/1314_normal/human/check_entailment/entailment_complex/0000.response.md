Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values, builds the relationships between the vertices based on the edges provided, and then checks if there exists a spanning tree where the degree of the first vertex is equal to D. If such a spanning tree exists, it prints "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree. If no such spanning tree exists, it prints "NO".

The program ensures that the conditions specified in the problem description are met:
1. It checks if the degree of the first vertex is less than D, in which case it prints "NO".
2. It constructs a spanning tree based on the relationships between vertices and ensures that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D.
3. It prints the edges of the spanning tree if it exists.

Therefore, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.
