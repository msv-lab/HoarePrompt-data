According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `arr[el] == 0` is satisfied in the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]` and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. `arr[el]` is equal to 0**
