Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `vis`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, for the loop to execute one more time `nxt` must be a valid key in `dmain`; `sv` has `el` added to it, `el` is added to the set `vis`.
Output State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, for the loop to execute one more time `nxt` must be a valid key in `dmain`; `sv` has `el` added to it, `el` is added to the set `vis`**
