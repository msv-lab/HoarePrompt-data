Output State: **`sviaz` contains the unique elements from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the last element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, `dmain` may have removed elements based on the loop's condition, `sv` contains all elements from the iterations, `vis` contains all unique elements visited in the loop, `res` is a list containing all concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el`, `nxt` is the last popped element from `sv`. After executing the if statement, where `el` is not in `vis`, `vis` will be updated with the addition of `el` as a unique element, and `res` will have a new string appended to it. Additionally, the element `nxt` is removed from `dmain[el]`.**
