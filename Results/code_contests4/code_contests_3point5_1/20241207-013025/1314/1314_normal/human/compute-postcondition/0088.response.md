Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, all elements in `ds` that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0` will have their corresponding `arr` values updated to `cur`, and those elements will be added to the set `tov`. The loop will continue to iterate until `tov` becomes empty, updating `nxt` to the next value popped from `tov` in each iteration. Variables `el`, `cur`, and `ds` remain unchanged after the loop finishes.**
