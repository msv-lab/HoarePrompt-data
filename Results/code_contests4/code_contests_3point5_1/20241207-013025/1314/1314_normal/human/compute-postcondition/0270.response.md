Example Answer:
`el` is added to the set `vis` using the `add` method. The state of `el` is not mentioned, so its value is unknown. After execution, `el` is added to the set `vis`. Therefore, the Output State is: Element `el` is added to the set `sv`, `vis` contains `el`.
Output State: **Element `el` is added to the set `sv`, `vis` contains `el`**
