According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds` and the value assigned to `nxt`. If `ds` contains at least one element corresponding to `nxt`, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i`, `cur`, and `arr[i]` have been updated, and `tov` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` is incremented by 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated, `tov` contains at least one element, `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element corresponding to `nxt`**
