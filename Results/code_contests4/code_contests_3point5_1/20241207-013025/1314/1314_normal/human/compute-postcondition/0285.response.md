Example Answer:
The `el` is added to the set `sv`. This means that `el` is now included in the set `sv`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, for the loop to execute one more time `nxt` must be a valid key in `dmain`; `sv` has `el` added to it.
Output State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, for the loop to execute one more time `nxt` must be a valid key in `dmain`; `sv` has `el` added to it**
