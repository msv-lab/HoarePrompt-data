Output State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 3. `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it, `ds[nxt]` has at least one element, all elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur` for the loop to execute again. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` and `tov` has `el` added to it.**
