Example Answer:
The value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. The values of `arr[el]` and `cur` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `el` is added to the set `tov`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `el` is added to the set `tov`**
