Output State: **All variables remain integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `el` is added to `tov`. For the loop to execute one more time, `el` should be a valid index in `ds[nxt]`.**
