According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `el`, `cur`, `tov`, `ds`, and `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it, `ds[nxt]` has at least one element, all elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it, `ds[nxt]` has at least one element, all elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur`, if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` and `tov` has `el` added to it.**
