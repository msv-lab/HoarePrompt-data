According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `ds`, `nxt`, `arr`, and `tov`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` all need to be incremented by 2.
- `cur` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `arr[i]` needs to be updated with the new value of `cur`.
- `nxt` needs to be assigned a new value popped from `tov`.
- For the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must contain at least one element corresponding to `nxt`.
- If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` should be updated to `cur` and `el` should be added to `tov`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` are all integers incremented by 2. `cur` is an integer incremented by 1. `arr[i]` is updated with the value of `cur`. `tov` contains at least one element. `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`. For the loop to execute the second time, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element corresponding to `nxt`. Furthermore, if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `el` is added to `tov`.**
