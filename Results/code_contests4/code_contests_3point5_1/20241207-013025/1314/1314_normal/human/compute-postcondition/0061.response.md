Example Answer: 
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. This means that the set `tov` now contains one more element compared to its previous state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` may have changed due to the addition of the last element, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a dictionary with at least one element at the key `nxt`, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`.
Output State: **`tov` may have changed due to the addition of the last element, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a dictionary with at least one element at the key `nxt`, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`**
