Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; If the length of the set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed; `arr` is a list initialized with 0s of length `n + 1`; `i` is 3; `cur` is 1; `tov` is a set containing the integer 3.**
