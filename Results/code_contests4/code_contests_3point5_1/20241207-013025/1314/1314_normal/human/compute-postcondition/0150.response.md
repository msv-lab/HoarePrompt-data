According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the set `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is incremented by 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the value of `arr[i]` is updated to the incremented value of `cur`. Additionally, `tov` is a set containing the new value of `i`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the set `tov` must contain at least one element.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` is incremented by 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated, for the loop to execute the first time `tov` must contain at least one element**
