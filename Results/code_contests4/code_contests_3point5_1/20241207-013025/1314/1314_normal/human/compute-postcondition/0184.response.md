According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `el` iterating through the elements in `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must have at least one element. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute again:
State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it, `ds[nxt]` has at least one element, all elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur` for the loop to execute again**.
