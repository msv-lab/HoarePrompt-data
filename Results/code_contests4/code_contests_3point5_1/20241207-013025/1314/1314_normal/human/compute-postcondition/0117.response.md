Postcondition: ***`nxt` is 3, `tov` is [1, 2, el], for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a list or dictionary, `el` is the element at index 3 in `ds`, `arr` is a list or dictionary. If the value at index `el` in `arr` is equal to `cur`, then the overall state of the program remains unchanged.***
