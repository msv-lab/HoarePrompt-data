Postcondition: ***`sviaz` contains the unique elements from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the last element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, `dmain` may have removed elements based on the loop's condition, `sv` contains all elements from the iterations, `vis` contains all unique elements visited in the loop including `el`, `res` is a list containing all concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el`, `nxt` is the last popped element from `sv`, for the loop to execute one more time there should be elements remaining in `dmain[nxt]`. If `el` is not in `vis`, `sv` contains `el` along with all other variables retaining their original values, `vis` is updated with `el`, and `res` is updated with the new concatenated string.***
