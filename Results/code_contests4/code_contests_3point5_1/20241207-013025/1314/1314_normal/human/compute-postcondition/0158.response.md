Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is updated with the value of `cur`, where `el` is an element. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` are all integers incremented by 2, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least one element, `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`, and `arr[el]` is updated with the value of `cur`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` are all integers incremented by 2, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least one element, `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`, and `arr[el]` is updated with the value of `cur`**
