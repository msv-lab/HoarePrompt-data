Example Answer:
A set `tov` is created with the value `i`, where `i` is incremented by 2. Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, the new value of `i` can be calculated as the previous value of `i` + 2. The value of `cur` is also incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the new value of `i`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the new value of `i`**
