Example Answer:
The value of `res` is appended with the string representation of `nxt` followed by a space and then the string representation of `el`. The values of `nxt` and `el` are not defined in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` contains `el`, all other variables remain the same, `vis` contains `el`, and `res` has been updated with the new string.
Output State: **`sv` contains `el`, all other variables remain the same, `vis` contains `el`, `res` has been updated with the new string**
