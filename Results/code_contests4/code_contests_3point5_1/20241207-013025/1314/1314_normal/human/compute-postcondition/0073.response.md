Example Answer:
`nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov`. The value of `tov` may have changed due to the removal of an element. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` may have changed due to removal or addition of elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `arr` may have been updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `el`, `cur`, `ds` are variables, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0.
