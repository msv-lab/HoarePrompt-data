Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. The variables `nxt`, `el`, and `arr[el]` are updated based on the new value of `el`. The loop will execute again if the length of `tov` is greater than 0. 
Output State: **`tov` has elements, `nxt` is updated, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `arr` may have been updated, loop will execute again if the length of `tov` is greater than 0**
