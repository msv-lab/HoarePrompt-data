According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ds`, `nxt`, and `el`. If `el` is a valid index in `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` are all integers incremented by 2, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it, `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `el` is added to `tov`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `el` should be a valid index in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` are all integers incremented by 2, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it, `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `el` is added to `tov`, for the loop to execute one more time `el` should be a valid index in `ds[nxt]`**
