According to the code, the loop depends on the elements in the set `sviaz`, the array `arr`, and the elements in the `ite` array. If the condition `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` is met, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sviaz` contains elements copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, and `el` is the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain`.

To execute the loop one more time, the element `arr[el]` should not be in `sviaz`. Therefore, the next element `el` in `ite` should be such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`.

State: **`sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the next element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute again**
