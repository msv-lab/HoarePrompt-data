Example Answer:
The value of `el` is determined by `ds[nxt]`, the value of `arr[el]` is then updated to `cur`. The state of `arr` may have been modified. For the loop to execute again, the length of `tov` should be greater than 0. 
Output State: **`tov` has elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `arr` may have been updated, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0**
