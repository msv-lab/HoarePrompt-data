Output State: All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then after the execution of the if else block, `arr[el]` will be equal to `cur`. After the execution of the code `tov` will contain `el` added to it.
