According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of the set `tov` is non-zero. Right before the loop, `tov` contains the integer 3, which means the loop will execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; If the length of the set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed; `arr` is a list where the element at index 3 is `cur` and the rest are initialized with 0s; `i` is 3; `cur` is 1; `tov` is a set containing the integer 3.**
