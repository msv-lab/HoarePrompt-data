According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `tov` and `ds`. If `tov` still has elements left, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` has elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `arr` may have been updated. So for the loop to execute again, the length of `tov` should be greater than 0.
State: **`tov` has elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `arr` may have been updated, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0**
