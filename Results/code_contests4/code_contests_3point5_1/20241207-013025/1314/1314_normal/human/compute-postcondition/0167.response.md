Example Answer:
`nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov`. Since `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it, `nxt` will hold the value of the popped element. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. For the loop to execute again, the condition `arr[el] == 0` must be satisfied in the next iteration.
