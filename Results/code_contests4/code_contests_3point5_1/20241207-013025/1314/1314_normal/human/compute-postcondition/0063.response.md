According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values `ds`, `nxt`, `el`, and `arr`. If `el` is less than the length of `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` may have changed, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `ds` is a dictionary with at least one element at the key `nxt`, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
1. If `el` is less than the length of `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute again. So, `el` needs to be increased by 1.
2. If `el` is equal to the length of `ds[nxt]`, then we need to update `nxt` to the next value popped from `tov`.
3. If `nxt` is updated, then `ds` needs to be checked to ensure it has at least one element at the key `nxt`.
4. Once `nxt` and `ds` are updated, `el` should be set to the first element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`tov` may have changed due to the removal or addition of the last element, `nxt` is updated to the next value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute another time `ds` is a dictionary with at least one element at the key `nxt`, `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`**
