Example Answer:
The value `nxt` and `el` are concatenated as strings and appended to the list `res`. The previous values of `res`, `nxt`, and `el` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `vis` now contains the updated unique elements after adding `el`, `res` has a new string appended to it.
Output State: **`vis` now contains the updated unique elements after adding `el`, `res` has a new string appended to it**
