According to the code, the loop can execute again if the set `tov` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the program state needs to be adjusted so that the set `tov` is not empty to continue the loop. Additionally, the variable `nxt` needs to be updated to the next value from `tov` to maintain the loop condition.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, to execute one more time, `tov` is not empty and `nxt` is updated to the next value from `tov`.**
