Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur` remain unchanged. The loop continues with the updated value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `cur` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1**.
