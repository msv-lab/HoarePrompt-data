Example Answer:
The value of `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov` using the `pop()` method, which removes that element from `tov`. If `tov` is not empty, `nxt` will be updated to the next value from `tov`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` may have changed due to the removal of the last element, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`.
Output State: **`tov` may have changed due to the removal of the last element, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`**
