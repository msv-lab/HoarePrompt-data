Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. The value of `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, and `ds[nxt]` has at least one element. Given that `arr[el]` was initially 0, after this assignment, `arr[el]` will be equal to `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` may have changed due to the removal of the last element, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a dictionary with at least one element at the key `nxt`, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`.
Output State: **`tov` may have changed due to the removal of the last element, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a dictionary with at least one element at the key `nxt`, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`**
