Example Answer: 
After executing `vis.add(1)`, the element 1 is added to the set `vis`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sviaz` contains the unique elements from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the last element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute, `dmain` may have removed elements based on the loop's condition, `sv` contains 1, `vis` contains 1.
Output State: **`sviaz` contains the unique elements from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the last element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute, `dmain` may have removed elements based on the loop's condition, `sv` contains 1, `vis` contains 1**
