Example Answer:
`sviaz` adds the element `arr[el]`, `dmain` and `arr` are not affected. The loop will continue executing as long as `el` is the next element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the next element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the next element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute again**
