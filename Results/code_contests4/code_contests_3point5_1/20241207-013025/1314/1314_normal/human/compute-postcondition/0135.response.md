Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. The value of `cur` is now assigned to the element at index `el` in `arr`. The set `tov` is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ds` is not empty, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `el` continues to iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`.
Output State: **`ds` is not empty, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `el` continues to iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`**
