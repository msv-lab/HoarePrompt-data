According to the code, the loop can execute as long as m is at least 0. Before the loop starts, the values of n, m, and D are already assigned. So, to execute the loop the first time, you need to adjust `i` to be 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is initialized as a defaultdict with an empty set; `dmain` is initialized as a defaultdict with an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
