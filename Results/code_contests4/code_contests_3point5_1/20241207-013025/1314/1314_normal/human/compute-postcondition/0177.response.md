According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `el` and `ds[nxt]`. If there are more elements in `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then after the execution of the if else block, `arr[el]` will be equal to `cur`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then after the execution of the if else block, `arr[el]` will be equal to `cur`.**
