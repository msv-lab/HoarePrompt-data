Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, and `cur` have their final values after the loop finishes executing. All elements in `ds` will have their corresponding `arr` values updated to `cur`. The loop control variable `i` will have a final value after the loop finishes. Additionally, `cur` is greater than `D`.***
