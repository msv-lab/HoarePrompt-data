According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the length of `tov` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` may have changed due to the removal or addition of elements. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `tov` needs to have elements remaining, so the length of `tov` should be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`tov` may have changed due to the removal or addition of elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `arr` may have been updated based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `el`, `cur`, `ds` are variables, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0**
