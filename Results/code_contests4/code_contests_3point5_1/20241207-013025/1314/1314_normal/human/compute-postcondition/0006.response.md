Example Answer:
Variables `s` and `f` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the input line on spaces. The values of `s` and `f` are obtained from the input and converted to integers using list comprehension. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is initialized as a defaultdict with an empty set; `dmain` is initialized as a defaultdict with an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `s` and `f` are assigned integer values obtained from the input line.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is initialized as a defaultdict with an empty set; `dmain` is initialized as a defaultdict with an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `s` and `f` are assigned integer values obtained from the input line.**
