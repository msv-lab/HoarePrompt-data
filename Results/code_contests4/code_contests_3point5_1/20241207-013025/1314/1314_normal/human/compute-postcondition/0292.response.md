Example Answer:
`el` is added to the set `vis`. The values of `dmain[el]`, `nxt`, and `sv` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` is updated with the addition of `el`, `vis` has `el` added to it.
Output State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` is updated with the addition of `el`, `vis` has `el` added to it**
