Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers obtained from the input line. `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing `f`, `s`, and the value of `f` added to the set corresponding to key `s`. `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing `f` and `s`. For the loop to execute the third time, `i` is 2. `f` is assigned an integer value obtained from the input line. `s` is assigned an integer value obtained from the input line. `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1. `dmain[f].add(s)`. `m` is greater than 1. `s` and `f` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input line on spaces. `dmain[s].add(f)` and `s` is added to the set corresponding to key `f` in `dmain. `s` and `f` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input line on spaces. `ds[s].add(f)`. `ds[f].add(s)` and `dmain[s].add(f) are executed.**
