Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; If the length of the set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed; `arr` is a list initialized with 0s of length `n + 1`; `i` is assigned the value 2; `cur` is assigned the value 0. At the end of the loop execution, all elements in `ds` that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0` will have their corresponding `arr` values updated to `cur`, and those elements will be added to the set `tov`. The loop will continue to iterate until `tov` becomes empty, updating `nxt` to the next value popped from `tov` in each iteration. Variables `el`, `cur`, and `ds` remain unchanged after the loop finishes.***
