Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` are all integers incremented by 2. `cur` is an integer incremented by 1. `arr[i]` is updated with the value of `cur`. `tov` contains at least one element. `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`. For the loop to execute the first time, `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element corresponding to `nxt`. Furthermore, if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `el` is added to `tov`.***
