According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `el`, `ds`, and `nxt`. If there are more elements in `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tov`, `nxt`, `ds`, `el`, `cur`, `arr` are variables. If `arr[el]` was equal to 0, it was updated to the value of `cur`, and `el` was added to the set `tov`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next element in `ds[nxt]` should be available.
State: **`tov`, `nxt`, `ds`, `el`, `cur`, `arr` are variables. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to the value of `cur`, and `el` is added to the set `tov` for the loop to execute another time.**
