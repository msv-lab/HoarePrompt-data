According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again**
