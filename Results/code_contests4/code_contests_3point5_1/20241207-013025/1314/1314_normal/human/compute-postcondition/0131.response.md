Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, where `el` iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]` and the element at index `el` in `ds[nxt]` is equal to 0. Therefore, after execution, the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to the value of `cur`.
Output State: **The element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to the value of `cur`.**
