According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `ds`, `nxt`, `el`, and `arr`. If there are more elements in `ds[nxt]` to iterate over and the element at index `el` in `arr` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ds` is not empty, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `el` is iterating over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that there are more elements in `ds[nxt]` to iterate over and the element at index `el` in `arr` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the state adjustments for the next iteration are:
State: **`ds` is not empty, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `el` continues to iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`**.
