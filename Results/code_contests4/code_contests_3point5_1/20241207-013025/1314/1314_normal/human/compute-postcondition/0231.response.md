According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `sv` is non-zero. Right before the loop, `sv` contains 1, so it is not empty and the loop will execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`sviaz` contains the unique elements from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the last element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, `dmain` may have removed elements based on the loop's condition, `sv` contains 1, `vis` contains 1, `res` is a list containing 'YES'**
