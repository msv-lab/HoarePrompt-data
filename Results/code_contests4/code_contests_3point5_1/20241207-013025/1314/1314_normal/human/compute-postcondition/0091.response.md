According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted to its current value plus 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; If the length of the set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed; `arr` is a list initialized with 0s of length `n + 1`; `i` is assigned the value 2; `cur` is assigned the value 0; `i` is incremented by 1; for the loop to execute again `i` is adjusted to its current value plus 1**
