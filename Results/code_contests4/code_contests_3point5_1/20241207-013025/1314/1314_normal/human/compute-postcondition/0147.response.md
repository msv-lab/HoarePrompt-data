Example Answer:
`cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is unknown, so after execution, `cur` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again; `cur` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again; `cur` is incremented by 1**
