Postcondition: ***`sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain`, the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, and additional elements based on the loop execution. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, the loop continues adding elements to `sviaz`. Otherwise, `sviaz` only contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the next element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute again, and `dmain[el]` has removed the element 1***
