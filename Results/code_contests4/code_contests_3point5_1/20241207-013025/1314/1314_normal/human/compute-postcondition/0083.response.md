According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `tov`, `ds`, `arr`, and the values of `nxt`, `el`, and `cur`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `tov` has elements, a value was popped from `tov` and assigned to `nxt`, `el` was assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` was assigned the value of `cur`, and `arr` may have been updated. If `arr[el]` is 0, the loop will execute again if the length of `tov` is greater than 0. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time:
State: **`tov` has elements, a value popped from `tov` is assigned to `nxt`, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `arr` may have been updated. If `arr[el]` is 0, the loop will execute again if the length of `tov` is greater than 0**.
