According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ds` and `nxt`. Since `tov` is not directly involved in the loop condition, we need to focus on ensuring that `ds` is not empty and `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`. Additionally, the loop variable `el` should iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`ds` is not empty, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `el` iterates over the elements in `ds[nxt]`**
