Example Answer:
The value from the top of the `tov` stack is removed and assigned to `nxt`. Since all variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1, and `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it, the specific values of the variables are not known. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it. All elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it. All elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur` for the loop to execute again.**
