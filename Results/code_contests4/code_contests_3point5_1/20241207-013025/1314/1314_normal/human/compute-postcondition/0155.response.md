Example Answer:
The value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. The previous states of the affected variables are as follows: `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i`, `cur`, `arr[i]`, `tov`, `nxt`, `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]`. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i` is incremented by 2, `cur` is incremented by 1, `arr[i]` is updated with the value of `cur`, `tov` contains at least one element, `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` contains at least one element corresponding to `nxt`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `tov` contains the added `el`**
