Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the program state will be such that if the condition `arr[el] == 0` is true for any `el` in `ds`, then `arr[el]` will be updated to the value of `cur` and `el` will be added to the set `tov`. Additionally, `nxt` will be updated to the next value from `tov` to maintain the condition for the loop to execute again.**
