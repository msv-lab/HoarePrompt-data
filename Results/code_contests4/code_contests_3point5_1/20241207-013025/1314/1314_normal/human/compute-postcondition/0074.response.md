According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ds`, `nxt`, and `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, `tov` should have elements, `nxt` should be updated to the value popped from `tov`, and `el` should be assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`. 
State: **`tov` has elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr` may have been updated, `cur` and `ds` are variables, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0**.
