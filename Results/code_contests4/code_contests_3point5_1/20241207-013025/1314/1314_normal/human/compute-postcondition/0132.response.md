Example Answer:
The element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`. The previous values of `el`, `arr`, and `tov` are not known. Therefore, the Output State is: The element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`.
Output State: **The element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`**
