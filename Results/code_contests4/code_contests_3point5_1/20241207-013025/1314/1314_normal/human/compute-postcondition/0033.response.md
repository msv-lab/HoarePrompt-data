Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input. If the length of the set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. `arr` is a list initialized with 0s of length `n + 1`. `i` is assigned the value 2.**
