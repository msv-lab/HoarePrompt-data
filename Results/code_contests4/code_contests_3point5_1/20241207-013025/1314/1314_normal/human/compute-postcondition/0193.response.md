According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `ds[nxt]`. For the loop to execute another time, the list `ds[nxt]` must still have elements, and all elements must have `arr[el]` equal to the current value of `cur`. Additionally, if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` should be updated to the current value of `cur`, and `el` should be added to `tov`.

At the end of the previous iteration, all variables are incremented by 2, except `cur` which is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **All variables are integers incremented by 4, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it, `ds[nxt]` has at least one element, all elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur` and `tov` has `el` added to it.**
