According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `dmain` and `nxt`. If `nxt` is a valid key in `dmain`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nxt` must be a valid key in `dmain`.
State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, for the loop to execute one more time `nxt` must be a valid key in `dmain`**
