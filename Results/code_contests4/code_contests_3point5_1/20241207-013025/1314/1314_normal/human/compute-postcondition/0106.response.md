According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are elements in the list `ds` at index `nxt`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` remain unchanged. `nxt` is 3, length of set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is greater than or equal to `D`, and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. Additionally, `tov` now has the next element from `ds[nxt]` added to it. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the program state remains the same as before the if else block executes. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the next element in `ds[nxt]` should be considered, and the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` remain unchanged. `nxt` is 3, length of set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is greater than or equal to `D`, and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. Additionally, `tov` now has the next element from `ds[nxt]` added to it.**
