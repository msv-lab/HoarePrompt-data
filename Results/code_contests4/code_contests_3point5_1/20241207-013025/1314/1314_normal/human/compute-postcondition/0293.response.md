Example Answer:
The `res` list has a new string appended to it, which consists of the concatenation of the string representation of `nxt` and `el`. The variables `nxt` and `el` are assumed to have specific values. The states of `dmain[el]`, `sv`, and `vis` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` is updated with the addition of `el`, `vis` has `el` added to it, `res` has a new string appended**
