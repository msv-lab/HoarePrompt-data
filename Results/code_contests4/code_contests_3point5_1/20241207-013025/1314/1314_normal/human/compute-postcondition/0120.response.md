Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the list `tov`. Since `el` is part of the `tov` list and the length of `tov` is now increased by 1, the output state is: `nxt` is 3, `tov` is [1, 2, el, el], `ds` is a list or dictionary with a length greater than `el`, `el` is less than 4, `arr` is a list or dictionary where `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.
Output State: **`nxt` is 3, `tov` is [1, 2, el, el], `ds` is a list or dictionary with a length greater than `el`, `el` is less than 4, `arr` is a list or dictionary where `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`**
