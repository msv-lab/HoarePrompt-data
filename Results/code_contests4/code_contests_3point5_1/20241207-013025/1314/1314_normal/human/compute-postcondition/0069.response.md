Example Answer:
The value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov`, `nxt`, `ds`, `el`, `cur`, `arr` are variables, and `el` is added to the set `tov`.
Output State: **`tov`, `nxt`, `ds`, `el`, `cur`, `arr` are variables, and `el` is added to the set `tov`**
