Example Answer:
`ds[s].add(f)` adds the value of `f` to the set corresponding to key `s` in the defaultdict `ds`. Since `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, the value of `f` obtained from the input line is added to the set corresponding to key `s`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing `f`, `s`, and the value of `f` added to the set corresponding to key `s`; `dmain` is a defaultdict with a set containing `f`; for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1; `f` is assigned an integer value obtained from the input line; `s` is assigned an integer value obtained from the input line; `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1; `dmain[f].add(s)`; `m` is greater than 1; `s` and `f` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input line on spaces.**
