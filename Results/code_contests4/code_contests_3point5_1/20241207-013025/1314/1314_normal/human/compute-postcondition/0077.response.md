Example Answer:
`el` is added to `tov`. The values of `tov`, `nxt`, `ds`, `arr`, and `cur` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` has elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `arr` may have been updated, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0.
Output State: **`tov` has elements, `nxt` is updated to the value popped from `tov`, `el` is assigned a value from `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `arr` may have been updated, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` should be greater than 0.**
