Postcondition: ***All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. For the loop to execute again, `arr[el] == 0` must be satisfied in the next iteration. In addition, after entering the if condition, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`.***
