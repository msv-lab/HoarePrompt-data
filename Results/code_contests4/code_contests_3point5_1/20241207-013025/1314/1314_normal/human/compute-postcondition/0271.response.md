Example Answer: 
A string is created by concatenating the string representation of `nxt`, a space, and the string representation of `el`. This string is appended to the list `res`. The variables `nxt` and `el` are used in creating the string, but their initial values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: Element `el` is added to the set `sv`, `vis` contains `el`, a string created from `nxt` and `el` is appended to the list `res`.
Output State: **Element `el` is added to the set `sv`, `vis` contains `el`, a string created from `nxt` and `el` is appended to the list `res`**
