Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ds` is not empty, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `el` continues to iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`, `el` is added to `tov`.
Output State: **`ds` is not empty, `nxt` is a valid index in `ds`, `el` continues to iterate over the elements in `ds[nxt]`, and if `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the element at index `el` in `arr` is added to the set `tov`, `el` is added to `tov`**
