According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` is not provided, so we need to adjust `tov` to have a length greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`nxt` is 3, `tov` is [1, 2, el], all elements in `ds` have been iterated over and their corresponding values in `arr` have been updated to `cur` if they were initially 0, for the loop to execute again `tov` length is greater than 0**
