Postcondition: ***`sviaz` is a set containing the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty (copied element from index 1 of set `dmain`), `el` is the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` for the loop to execute. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, the element `arr[el]` is added to `sviaz`. If `arr[el]` is already in `sviaz`, no changes are made to `sviaz`.***
