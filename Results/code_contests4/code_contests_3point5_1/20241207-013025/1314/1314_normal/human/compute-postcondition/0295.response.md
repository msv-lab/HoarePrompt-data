Example Answer:
The element `nxt` is removed from `dmain[el]`, but the values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` is updated with the addition of `el`, `vis` has `el` added to it, `res` has a new string appended.
Output State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` is updated with the addition of `el`, `vis` has `el` added to it, `res` has a new string appended**
