Postcondition: ***`sviaz` contains unique elements from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the first element in `dmain[nxt]`, `dmain` may have removed elements based on the loop's condition, `sv` contains elements for iteration including the added `el`, `vis` contains all unique elements visited in the loop including `el`, `res` is a list containing all concatenated strings of `nxt` and `el`, `nxt` is the last popped element from `sv`, for the loop to execute again length of `sv` is greater than 0, a new concatenated string of `nxt` and `el` is added to `res` if `el` is not in `vis`.***
