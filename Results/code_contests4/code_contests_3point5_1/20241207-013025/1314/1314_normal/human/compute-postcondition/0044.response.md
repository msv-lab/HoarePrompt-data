Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `D` are integers obtained by splitting the input line on spaces; `ds` is a defaultdict with a set containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; `dmain` is a defaultdict with sets containing all pairs of `f` and `s` from the input; If the length of the set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed; `arr` is a list where `arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and all other values remain the same; `i` is assigned the value 2; `cur` is incremented by 1; `tov` is a set containing the values 2 and at least one more element to execute the loop the first time; `nxt` is assigned the value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time the set in `ds` corresponding to key `nxt` is not empty. Additionally, when the if condition `(arr[el] == 0)` is true, the program state is such that `el` is a valid index for array `arr`, and the value at index `el` in `arr` is 0, `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`**
