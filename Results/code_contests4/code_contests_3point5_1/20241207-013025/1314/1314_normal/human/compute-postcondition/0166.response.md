According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables (`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i`) are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `el` is added to `tov`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `tov` must have at least one element with `el` added to it
- `nxt` must be assigned a value popped from `tov`
- The condition `arr[el] == 0` must be satisfied in the next iteration for the loop to continue

State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`. For the loop to execute again, the condition `arr[el] == 0` must be satisfied in the next iteration**
