According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the length of `tov` is not zero. At the end of the previous iteration, all variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it. All elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains elements with `el` added to it. All elements in `ds[nxt]` have `arr[el]` equal to `cur` for the loop to execute again.**
