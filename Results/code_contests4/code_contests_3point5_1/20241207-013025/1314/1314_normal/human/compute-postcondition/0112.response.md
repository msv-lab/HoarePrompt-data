Example Answer:
The value of `nxt` is assigned the last element of the list `tov` using the `pop()` method, which removes and returns the last element of the list. If `tov` is initially `[1, 2, 3]`, then after executing the code, `nxt` will be assigned the value `3` and `tov` will be `[1, 2]`.
Output State: **`nxt` is 3, `tov` is [1, 2]**
