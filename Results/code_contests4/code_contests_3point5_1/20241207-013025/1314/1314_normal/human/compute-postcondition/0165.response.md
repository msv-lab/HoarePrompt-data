Output State: **All variables (`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `i`) are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. `nxt` is assigned a value popped from `tov`. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated to `cur` and `el` is added to `tov`. The loop will continue until there are no more elements left in `ds[nxt]` that satisfy the condition `arr[el] == 0`.**
