According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the element `el` in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, and `el` is the next element in `ite`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the next `el` in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`.

State: **`sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the next element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute again**.
