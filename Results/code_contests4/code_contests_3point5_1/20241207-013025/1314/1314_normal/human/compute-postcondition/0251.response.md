Output State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed from it, `sv` contains the unique elements from index 1 of set `dmain` and array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the first element in `dmain[nxt]`, `dmain` may have removed elements based on the loop's condition, `sv` contains `el`, `vis` contains 1, `res` is a list containing 'YES', `nxt` contains the popped element from `sv`, for the loop to execute the second time `dmain` has elements corresponding to `el`, `el` is not in `vis`, `vis` now contains `el`, `res` contains the concatenated string of `nxt` and `el`, `sv` adds `el`, `vis` adds `el`, and `res` appends the string representation of `nxt` concatenated with a space and the string representation of `el`, `sv` now has `el` added to it, `vis` now contains `el`, `res` now contains the previous elements along with the new concatenated string of `nxt` and `el`**
