Example Answer:
The element at index 3 in `ds` is stored in `el`. The value at index `el` in `arr` is equal to `cur`. The `add` method is called on `tov` to add the value of `el` to it. Since `tov` is a list, the element `el` will be added to `tov`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nxt` is 3, `tov` is [1, 2, el], for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a list or dictionary, `el` is the element at index 3 in `ds`, `arr` is a list or dictionary, the value at index `el` in `arr` is equal to `cur`.
Output State: **`nxt` is 3, `tov` is [1, 2, el], for the loop to execute the first time `ds` is a list or dictionary, `el` is the element at index 3 in `ds`, `arr` is a list or dictionary, the value at index `el` in `arr` is equal to `cur`**
