Example Answer:
`nxt` is removed from `dmain[el]`. If `el` is not in `vis`, `el` is added to `sv` and `vis`. The changes in `dmain[el]`, `sv`, and `vis` depend on their initial values and whether `el` is already in `vis`. Therefore, the Output State is: *`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` and `vis` are updated based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`dmain[el]` has `nxt` removed, `sv` and `vis` are updated based on the conditions mentioned**
