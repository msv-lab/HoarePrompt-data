According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ds` at index `nxt`. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nxt` is 3, length of set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is greater than or equal to `D`, and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. Additionally, `tov` has the element `el` added to it.

To execute the loop one more time, the next element `el` in the list `ds[nxt]` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` remain unchanged; `nxt` is 3, length of set in `dmain` corresponding to key 1 is greater than or equal to `D`, and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`. Additionally, `tov` now has the next element from `ds[nxt]` added to it.**
