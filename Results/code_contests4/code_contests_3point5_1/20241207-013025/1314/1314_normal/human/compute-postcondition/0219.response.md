Postcondition: ***`sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the next element in `ite` such that `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz` for the loop to execute again. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dmain[el]` removes the element 1.***
