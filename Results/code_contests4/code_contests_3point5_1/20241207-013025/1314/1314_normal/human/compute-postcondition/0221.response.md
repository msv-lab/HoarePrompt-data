Example Answer:
`sviaz` has the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain` and the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`. `arr[el]` is added to `sviaz`. The loop will continue executing until the condition `arr[el]` not in `sviaz` is met. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain`, the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, and additional elements based on the loop execution.
Output State: **`sviaz` contains the element copied from index 1 of set `dmain`, the element copied from index 1 of array `arr`, and additional elements based on the loop execution**
