Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers; `ds` and `dmain` are defaultdicts with sets of pairs of `f` and `s`; if arr[i] == 0, then all elements in `ds` have been iterated over, updating `arr[el]` to `cur` for each `el`. The elements that have been updated are added to the set `tov`. The loop terminates, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is 3, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur` remain unchanged.***
