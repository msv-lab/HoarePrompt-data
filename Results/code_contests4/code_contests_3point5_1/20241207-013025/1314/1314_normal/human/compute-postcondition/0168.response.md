According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `el` and `ds[nxt]`. If ds[nxt] has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute again, the condition `arr[el] == 0` must be satisfied in the next iteration. 

Before the loop starts, all variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1. `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it. 

So, for the loop to be executed the first time, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el] == 0`, and all variables are incremented accordingly.
State: **All variables are integers incremented by 2, except `cur` which is an integer incremented by 1, `tov` contains at least one element with `el` added to it, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el] == 0`, for the loop to execute again `arr[el] == 0` must be satisfied in the next iteration**
