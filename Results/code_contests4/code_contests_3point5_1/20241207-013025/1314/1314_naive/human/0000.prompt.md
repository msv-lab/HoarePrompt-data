You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

Your task is to find any spanning tree of this graph such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label 1 on it) is equal to D (or say that there are no such spanning trees). Recall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and D (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2)), 1 ≤ D < n) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and required degree of the first vertex, respectively.

The following m lines denote edges: edge i is represented by a pair of integers v_i, u_i (1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair (v_i, u_i) there are no other pairs (v_i, u_i) or (u_i, v_i) in the list of edges, and for each pair (v_i, u_i) the condition v_i ≠ u_i is satisfied.

Output

If there is no spanning tree satisfying the condition from the problem statement, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line and then print n-1 lines describing the edges of a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label 1 on it) is equal to D. Make sure that the edges of the printed spanning tree form some subset of the input edges (order doesn't matter and edge (v, u) is considered the same as the edge (u, v)).

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
