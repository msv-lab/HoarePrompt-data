Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input and constructs a graph based on the provided edges. It then checks if a spanning tree can be formed such that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D. The program then outputs the edges of the spanning tree if it exists.

The program follows the problem description and correctly determines if a spanning tree meeting the conditions can be formed or not. Additionally, the program outputs the correct edges of the spanning tree if it exists. The logic and implementation seem correct and handle the given problem requirements effectively. No potential case has been identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
