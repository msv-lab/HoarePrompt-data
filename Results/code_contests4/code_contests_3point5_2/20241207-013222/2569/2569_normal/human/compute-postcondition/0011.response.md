Example Answer:
`pi` is assigned the value of -k + i, where `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, the value of `pi` is -k + 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`left` is updated based on the comparison of `bikes[1] - person[-k]` with 0, `b` is updated based on the addition of the minimum value between `person[-k]` and `bikes[1]`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is -k + 2**
