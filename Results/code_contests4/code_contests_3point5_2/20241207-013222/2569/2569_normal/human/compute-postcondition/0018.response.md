Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a parameter `k` and performs calculations to update the values of 'b' and 'left'. It iterates over a range of `k`, updating 'left' based on comparisons between elements of the lists `bikes` and `person`. 'b' is updated based on the minimum value between corresponding elements of `person` and `bikes`. Finally, 'b' is adjusted by subtracting 'left', and the function returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left'. It is important to note that the annotations mention specific conditions and calculations, but the actual code does not fully reflect the described logic, so the functionality may differ from what the annotations imply.**
