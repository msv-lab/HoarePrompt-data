Example Answer:
The value of `left` is updated by subtracting the maximum of 0 and the result of `bikes[i] - person[pi]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `left` is assigned the value of a, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, and `pi` is -k. After the execution, the new value of `left` depends on the comparison of `bikes[i] - person[pi]` with 0. 
Output State: **`left` is updated based on the comparison of `bikes[i] - person[pi]` with 0, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `pi` is -k**
