#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The sequences b1, b2, ..., bn and p1, p2, ..., pm are lists of integers where 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ pj ≤ 10^9 respectively.**
def func_1(k):
    left = a
    b = 0
    for i in range(k):
        pi = -k + i
        
        left -= max(0, bikes[i] - person[pi])
        
        b += min(person[pi], bikes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` is updated based on the comparison of `bikes[i] - person[pi]` with 0 for all i, `b` is updated based on the addition of the minimum value between `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]` for all i, `i` is k-1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `pi` is -k + k-1
    b -= left
    return b, left
    #The program returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left' after the calculations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter `k` and performs calculations to update the values of 'b' and 'left'. It iterates over a range of `k`, updating 'left' based on comparisons between elements of the lists `bikes` and `person`. 'b' is updated based on the minimum value between corresponding elements of `person` and `bikes`. Finally, 'b' is adjusted by subtracting 'left', and the function returns the updated values of 'b' and 'left'. It is important to note that the annotations mention specific conditions and calculations, but the actual code does not fully reflect the described logic, so the functionality may differ from what the annotations imply.
