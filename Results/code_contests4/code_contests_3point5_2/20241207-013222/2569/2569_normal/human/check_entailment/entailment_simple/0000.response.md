Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` does not handle the input parameters n, m, a, b, and p as described in the problem description. The function only takes a single parameter k, which is not defined in the problem description. This means that the function does not calculate the maximum number of schoolboys that can rent a bike and the minimum total personal money needed as required by the problem description.

2. The calculation of `pi` as `-k + i` in the function is incorrect. It should be mapping the personal money of each boy to the bikes, but `-k + i` does not achieve this mapping correctly.

3. The logic inside the for loop is also incorrect. It subtracts `bikes[i] - person[pi]` from `left`, which is not the correct way to calculate the amount of money left after renting bikes. The variable `b` is also updated incorrectly by adding the minimum value between `person[pi]` and `bikes[i]` for all i.

Overall, the function does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description and therefore the correctness is False.
