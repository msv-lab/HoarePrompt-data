Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of schoolboys, number of bikes, shared budget, personal money of each boy, and the rental price of each bike.
2. The program then sorts the personal money and bike rental prices in ascending order to make it easier to calculate the minimum personal money needed for renting bikes.
3. The `func_1` function calculates the minimum personal money needed for a given number of schoolboys to rent bikes.
4. The program uses binary search to find the maximum number of schoolboys that can rent a bike and the minimum total personal money needed.
5. The output is formatted correctly as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic provided, and there are no apparent issues that would cause it to fail for any potential case.
