Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It calculates the maximum number of schoolboys that can rent a bike and the minimum total personal money needed to rent those bikes. The program uses binary search to find the optimal number of schoolboys that can rent a bike by checking if the remaining shared budget after renting the bikes is non-negative. The personal money is then calculated accordingly to minimize the total spending. The program iterates through all potential cases and finds the correct solution. Therefore, the program is correct in all cases.
