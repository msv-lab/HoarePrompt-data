Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through possible values of `i` to find a valid value to split the pebbles into rows. It then calculates the number of pebbles in each row, updates the count, and reduces the total number of pebbles until a single pebble is left. The final count is printed, which represents the maximum possible result of the game. 

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble. Therefore, the program is correct for all inputs within the specified constraints.
