Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints agree with the code and provide additional clarification. However, the code does not correctly calculate the maximum possible result of the game as described in the problem. For example, when n = 10, the expected output should be 16 according to the problem description. However, the code outputs 17. Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not handle all cases as per the problem description.
