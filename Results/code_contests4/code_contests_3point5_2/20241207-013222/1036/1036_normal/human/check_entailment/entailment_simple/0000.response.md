Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the maximum possible result of the game by arranging the pebbles according to the rules specified in the problem.

The program starts with the initial number of pebbles `n`, then iterates through possible divisors of `n` to determine the number of rows `b` in each step. It updates the count of pebbles and reduces `n` accordingly until `n` becomes 1.

The program properly handles the case where the final value of `n` is a prime number, as it breaks out of the loop and prints the correct count.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
