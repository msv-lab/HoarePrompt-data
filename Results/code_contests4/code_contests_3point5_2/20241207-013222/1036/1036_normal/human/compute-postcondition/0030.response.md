Postcondition: ***`count`, `n`, `b`, `i` are integers. `count` is updated based on whether `n` is a prime number. `b` is calculated as `n` divided by 2. Then `n` is updated by subtracting `b`. `n` is not equal to 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than the updated `n`. If divmod(n, i)[1] == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
