Postcondition: ***`count` is updated based on whether the new value of `n` is a prime number, `b` is calculated as `n` divided by the largest `i` less than `n`, `n` is updated by subtracting `b`, `n` is not equal to 1. If `b` is equal to 1, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
