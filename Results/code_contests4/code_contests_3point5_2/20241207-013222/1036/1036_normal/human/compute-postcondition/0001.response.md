Example Answer:
`count` is assigned the value of `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9. Since no calculations or transformations are applied to `n`, the value of `count` is the same as `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9; `count` is equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9; `count` is equal to `n`**
