Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any integer between 2 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9**
