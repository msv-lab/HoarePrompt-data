According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 2. Given that `count` is equal to `n`, the loop can execute if `count` is greater than 2 as well. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2 and `count` is greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `count` is greater than 2, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1**
