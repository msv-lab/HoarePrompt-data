Postcondition: ***`n` and `count` are integers. If the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The initial conditions remain the same: `n` is greater than 2, `count` is greater than 2, and for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to `n`.***
