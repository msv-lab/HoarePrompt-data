Output State: **`count` is updated based on whether `n` is a prime number, `b` is calculated as `n` divided by 2, `n` is updated by subtracting `b`, `n` is not equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the updated `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
