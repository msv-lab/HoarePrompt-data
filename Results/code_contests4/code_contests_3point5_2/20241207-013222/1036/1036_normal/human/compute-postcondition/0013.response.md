Output State: **`n` and `count` are integers. If `n` is a prime number, the loop will execute fully without breaking, `count` will be equal to `n`. If `n` is not a prime number, the loop will break early, and `count` will be less than `n`. In either case, `n` will remain the same as the initial value, and `count` will be updated accordingly.**
