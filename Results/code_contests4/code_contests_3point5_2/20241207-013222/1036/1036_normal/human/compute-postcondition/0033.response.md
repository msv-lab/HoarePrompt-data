Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by the value of `b`. The value of `b` is calculated as `n` divided by the largest `i` less than `n`, where `n` is updated by subtracting `b`. If `n` is a prime number, then `count` will be 1, otherwise 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is updated based on whether `n` is a prime number, `b` is calculated as `n` divided by the largest `i` less than `n`, `n` is updated by subtracting `b`, `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is a prime number, then `count` will be 1, otherwise 0.
Output State: **`count` is updated based on whether `n` is a prime number, `b` is calculated as `n` divided by the largest `i` less than `n`, `n` is updated by subtracting `b`, `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is a prime number, then `count` will be 1, otherwise 0**
