Postcondition: ***`count`, `n`, `b`, `i` are integers. After the execution of the if statement, `count` is updated based on whether the new value of `n` is a prime number. `b` is calculated as `n` divided by the largest `i` less than `n`. `n` is updated by subtracting `b`. `n` is not equal to 1. If `b` is equal to 1, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute the first time `i` is 2, divmod(n, i)[1] is equal to 0.***
