According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2 and `count` is greater than 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be updated to `n` for the loop to continue executing.
State: **`n` and `count` are integers. If the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` is updated to `n`.**
