Output State: **`count` is updated based on whether the final value of `n` is a prime number. `b` is calculated as the final `n` divided by the largest `i` less than the final `n`. `n` is updated by subtracting `b`. If `b` is equal to 1, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `n` is greater than or equal to 2. `b` is assigned the value of `n` floor divided by `i`.**
