The function `func` reads pairs of numbers from participants, processes them according to specific constraints, and prints the result. It does not accept any parameters explicitly. The function checks if there is a unique number in each list of pairs. If there is a unique number in either list, it prints that number. If there is no unique number, it prints 0. The function exits with -1 if certain conditions are not met during processing.
