Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, where `x1` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`.
Output State: **Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`.**
