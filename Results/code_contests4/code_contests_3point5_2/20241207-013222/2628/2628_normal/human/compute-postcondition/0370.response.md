Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 remain unchanged. The values of B[i][0] and B[i][1] are modified based on the conditions within the loop. If the sum of A[i][0] for i in range(n) is not equal to 1 and the sum of B[i][0] for i in range(m) is not equal to 1, then the loop will either print -1 and exit or increment B[i][0] and assign a new value to B[i][1].**
