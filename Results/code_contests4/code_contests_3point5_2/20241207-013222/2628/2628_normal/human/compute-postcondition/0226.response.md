Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, but the initial state of `y1` is not given. Therefore, the output state is: Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged; `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned an unknown value `y1`.
Output State: **Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged; `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]`; `B[i][0]` is increased by 1; `B[i][1]` is assigned an unknown value `y1`**
