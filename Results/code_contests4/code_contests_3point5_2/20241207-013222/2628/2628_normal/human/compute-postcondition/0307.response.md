Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged, i is incremented by 2m, for the loop to execute n is greater than 0 and i is incremented by 2m. x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. Additionally, the set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. x1 is not equal to x2 and x1 is not equal to y2. Moreover, when the condition (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2) is met. The condition (B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == y1) is met. B[i][0] is incremented by 1.**
