Postcondition: ***Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the program checks `B[i][1]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, the program continues without any further changes. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program checks `B[i][1]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed and the program exits. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, then `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
