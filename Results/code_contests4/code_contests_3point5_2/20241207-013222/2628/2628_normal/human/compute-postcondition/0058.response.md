Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. If `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, then `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `j`th element of list `b`, and the program exits. Otherwise, `A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `j`th element of list `b`, and the second element of the inner list at index `i` of `A` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
