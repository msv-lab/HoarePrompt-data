Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 remain unchanged. If B is not empty and there exists an element in B where the first element is equal to 1, then `ans` will be assigned the value of the first element's second value where the first element is 1. If no such element exists in B, then `ans` will not be assigned a value.**
