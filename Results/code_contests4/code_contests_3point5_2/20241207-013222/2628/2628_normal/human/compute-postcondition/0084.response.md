Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of the i-th list in list `A`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from list `b` based on index 0. The set of elements in the i-th list of `A` is not equal to the set of elements in list `b` at index 0. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`. Furthermore, after the if condition is met, `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. If the condition `(A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != y1)` is true, then `print(-1)` has been executed. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is either `x2` or `y2`.***
