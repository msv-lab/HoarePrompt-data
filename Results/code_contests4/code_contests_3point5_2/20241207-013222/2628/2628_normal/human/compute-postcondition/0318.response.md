Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The values of `x1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not given, so the output state is: `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.
Output State: **`x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`**
