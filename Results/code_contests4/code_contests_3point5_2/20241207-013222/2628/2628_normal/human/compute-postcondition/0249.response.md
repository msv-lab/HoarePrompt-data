Output State: **Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 1. B[i][0] and B[i][1] are updated based on conditions within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, i must be less than m. x1, y1 are assigned the values of b[i] and x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. Additionally, x1 is not equal to x2 and y2. The condition (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2) is true. The condition (B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != y1) is also true. `print(-1)` is executed.**
