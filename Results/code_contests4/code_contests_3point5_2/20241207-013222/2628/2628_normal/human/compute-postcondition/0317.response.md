Example Answer:
The value of B[i][0] is incremented by 1. The values of x2 and y2 become equal to a[j]. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: x2 and y2 are assigned the values of a[j], B[i][0] is incremented by 1.
Output State: **x2 and y2 are assigned the values of a[j], B[i][0] is incremented by 1**
