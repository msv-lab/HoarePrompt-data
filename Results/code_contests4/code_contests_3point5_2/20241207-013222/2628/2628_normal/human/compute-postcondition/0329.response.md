Example Answer:
`x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`, where `j` is a variable representing an index. The values of `a[j]` are unknown. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `B[i][0]`, and `B[i][1]` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: x1 is updated, y1 is updated, x2 is assigned the value of a[j], y2 is assigned the value of a[j], B[i][0] is incremented by 1, B[i][1] is updated based on the conditions.
Output State: **x1 is updated, y1 is updated, x2 is assigned the value of a[j], y2 is assigned the value of a[j], B[i][0] is incremented by 1, B[i][1] is updated based on the conditions**
