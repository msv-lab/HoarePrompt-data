Example Answer: 
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, but the previous values of `B[i][1]` and `y1` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, i, m remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.
Output State: **Values of A, i, m remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`**
