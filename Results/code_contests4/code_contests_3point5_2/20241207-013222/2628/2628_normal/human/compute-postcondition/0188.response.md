Postcondition: ***Values of A, i, x1, y1, m remain unchanged. x2 and y2 are updated to the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. Either x1 is equal to x2 or x1 is equal to y2, where x2 and y2 are updated to the values of a[j]. If B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != x1, the program prints -1. Otherwise, B[i][1] is either 0 or equal to x1.***
