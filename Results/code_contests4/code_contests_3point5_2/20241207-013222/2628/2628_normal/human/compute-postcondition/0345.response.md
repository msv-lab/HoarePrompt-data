Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 remain unchanged. The values of B[i][0] and B[i][1] are modified based on the conditions within the loop. If the sum of the first elements of A[i] for all i in the range of n is equal to 1 or the sum of the first elements of B[i] for all i in the range of m is equal to 1, then either -1 is printed and the loop exits or B[i][0] is incremented and a new value is assigned to B[i][1].***
