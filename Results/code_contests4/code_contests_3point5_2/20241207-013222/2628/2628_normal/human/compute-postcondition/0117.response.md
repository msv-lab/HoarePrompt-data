Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, then the i-th list is updated with the first element incremented by 1, and the values of `x1` and `y1` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, if `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the i-th list remains unchanged, and -1 is printed.***
