Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged, i is incremented by 2m for the loop to execute. x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. x1 is not equal to x2 and x1 is not equal to y2. When the condition (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2) is met. After entering the if condition (B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != y1), the program variables remain in the same state with the additional condition that B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to y1.**
