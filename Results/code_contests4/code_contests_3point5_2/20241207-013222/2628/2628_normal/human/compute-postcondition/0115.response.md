Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then the i-th list is updated where the first element is incremented by 1 and the values of `x1` and `y1` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, if `A[i][1] != 0` and `A[i][1] != y1`, the i-th list remains unchanged, and -1 is printed.***
