Postcondition: ***x1, y1, x2, y2 are updated. If set(b[i]) != set(a[j]), the program executes different conditional statements based on the values of B[i][1], x1, and y1. The conditions dictate the updates to B[i][0] and B[i][1]. The final state of the program variables depends on the specific conditions met during execution.***
