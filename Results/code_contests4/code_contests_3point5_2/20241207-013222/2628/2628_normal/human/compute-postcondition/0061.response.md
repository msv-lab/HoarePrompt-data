Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `j`th element of list `b`, and -1 is printed. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, and `A[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, then `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `j`th element of list `b`, and the program exits. If none of the previous conditions hold, `A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from the `j`th element of list `b`, and the second element of the inner list at index `i` of list `A` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
