Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two zeros except for the i-th list, where the first element is incremented by 1 and the second element is now equal to `x1`. `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of the i-th list in list `A`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from list `b` based on index 0. The set of elements in the i-th list of `A` is not equal to the set of elements in list `b` at index 0. Additionally, after the execution of the if else block, either `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2` and (A[i][1] = 0 or A[i][1] = x1). If `A[i][1] != 0` and `A[i][1] != x1`, the program terminates immediately without any further execution.***
