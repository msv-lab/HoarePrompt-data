Example Answer:
The values of x1 and y1 are assigned the values of the elements at index i in the list b. Since the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 are to remain the same as their initial values at the end of the loop, the values of x1 and y1 are the only ones affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 will remain the same as their initial values.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 will remain the same as their initial values**
