Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous value of `x1` is unknown, so the output state is: Values of A, i, m remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`.
Output State: **Values of A, i, m remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`**
