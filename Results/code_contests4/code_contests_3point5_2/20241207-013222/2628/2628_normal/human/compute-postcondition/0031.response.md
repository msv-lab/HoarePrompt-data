Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. If the set of elements at index `i` in `A` is not equal to the set of elements at index `j` in `B`, then the inner list at index `i` in `A` may have its elements updated based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `x2`. The variables `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` maintain their initial values.***
