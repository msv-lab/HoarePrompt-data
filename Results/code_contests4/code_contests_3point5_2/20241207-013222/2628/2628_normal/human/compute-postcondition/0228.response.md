Postcondition: ***Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged; `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the code prints -1. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned an unknown value `y1`.***
