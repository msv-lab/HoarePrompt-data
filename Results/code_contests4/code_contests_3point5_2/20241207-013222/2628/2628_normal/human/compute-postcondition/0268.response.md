Postcondition: ***Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `y1`, the loop does not execute, and `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unaffected. The program prints -1. If `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `y1`, the loop executes, `B[i][0]` is updated based on the loop condition. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. `x1`, `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. `B[i][1]` is updated to the value of `y1`.***
