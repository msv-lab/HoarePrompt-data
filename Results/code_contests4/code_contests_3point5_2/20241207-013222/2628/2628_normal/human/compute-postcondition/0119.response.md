According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `A`, `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` will remain the same as their initial values. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
