Postcondition: ***Values of A, i, x1, y1, m remain unchanged. x2 and y2 are updated to the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. x1 is not equal to x2 and x1 is not equal to y2. The condition (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2) is satisfied. If B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != y1, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, B[i][0] is incremented by 1, and (B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == y1), B[i][1] is assigned the value of y1.***
