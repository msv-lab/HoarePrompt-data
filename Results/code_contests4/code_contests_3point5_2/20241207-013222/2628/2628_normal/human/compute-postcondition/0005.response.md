Example Answer:
A is initialized as a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. The size of A is determined by the variable n. Since the initial state does not provide the value of n, we cannot determine the exact size of A. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **A is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. The size of A is determined by the unknown variable n.**
