Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. If `A[i][1] != 0` and `A[i][1] != x1`, then `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values at index `j` in list `B`. If the conditions are met, the program exits. If the conditions are not met, `A` remains the same, `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values at index `j` in list `B`, and the value at index 1 of the inner list at index `i` in list `A` is updated to the value of `y1`.***
