Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 2m. For the loop to execute, n must be greater than 0 and i is incremented by 2m. x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. Additionally, the set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. x1 is equal to either x2 or y2. If B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to x1, the program prints -1 as the output. If B[i][1] is equal to 0 or x1, then B[i][0] is incremented by 1.***
