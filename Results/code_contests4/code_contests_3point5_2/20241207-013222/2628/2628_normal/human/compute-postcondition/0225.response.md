Example Answer: 
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged. The states of `x2` and `y2` are not provided, so they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged; `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j] and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1.
Output State: **Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged; `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j] and `B[i][0]` is increased by 1**
