Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged, i is incremented by 2m, for the loop to execute n is greater than 0 and i is incremented by 2m. x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. Additionally, the set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. x1 is equal to either x2 or y2. B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and B[i][1] is not equal to x1. The program prints -1 as the output.**
