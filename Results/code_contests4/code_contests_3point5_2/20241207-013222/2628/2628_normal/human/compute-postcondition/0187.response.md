Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. The previous values of the affected variables are as described. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, i, x1, y1, m remain unchanged. x2 and y2 are updated to the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. Either x1 is equal to x2 or x1 is equal to y2, where x2 and y2 are updated to the values of a[j]. B[i][1] is either 0 or equal to x1 in this case.
Output State: **Values of A, i, x1, y1, m remain unchanged. x2 and y2 are updated to the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. Either x1 is equal to x2 or x1 is equal to y2, where x2 and y2 are updated to the values of a[j]. B[i][1] is either 0 or equal to x1 in this case.**
