Example Answer:
The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `B[i][0]` is updated based on the condition within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. `x1`, `y1` are assigned the values of `b[i]`, and `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`.
