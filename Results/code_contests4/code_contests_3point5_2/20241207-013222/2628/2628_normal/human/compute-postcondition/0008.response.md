Example Answer:
`x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of the `i-th` inner list of list `A`, which contains two zeros. Since `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` will both be assigned the value 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, B is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x1` is 0, `y1` is 0.
Output State: **A is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, B is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x1` is 0, `y1` is 0**
