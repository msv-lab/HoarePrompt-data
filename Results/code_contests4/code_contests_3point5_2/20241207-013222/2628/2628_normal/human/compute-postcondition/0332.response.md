Example Answer: 
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, so if the initial value of `B[i][0]` was `n`, after execution it becomes `n+1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: x1 is updated, y1 is updated, x2 is assigned the value of a[j], y2 is assigned the value of a[j], B[i][0] is `n+1`, B[i][1] is updated based on the conditions.
Output State: **x1 is updated, y1 is updated, x2 is assigned the value of a[j], y2 is assigned the value of a[j], B[i][0] is `n+1`, B[i][1] is updated based on the conditions**
