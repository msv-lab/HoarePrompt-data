Postcondition: ***Values of A, i, m remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the program will check if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`. If true, the program exits; otherwise, it continues with the updated values.***
