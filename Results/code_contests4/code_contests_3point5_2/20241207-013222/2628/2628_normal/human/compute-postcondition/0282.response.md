Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, where `y1` is unchanged. The values of `A`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. B[i][0] is incremented by 1. `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.
Output State: **Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. B[i][0] is incremented by 1. `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`**
