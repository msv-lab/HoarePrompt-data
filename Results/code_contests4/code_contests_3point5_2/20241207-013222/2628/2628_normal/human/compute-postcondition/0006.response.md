Example Answer:
The code creates a new list B with m number of inner lists, each containing two zeros. The size of list B is determined by the unknown variable m. Since the initial state mentions the variable n, which is not used in the provided code snippet, the output state will be:
Output State: **A is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros; B is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros**
