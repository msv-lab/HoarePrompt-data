Example Answer:
`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `B[i][0]` are unknown, so the new value is 1 greater than the previous value. The values of `x2` and `y2` are then assigned the values of `a[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`.
Output State: **`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]**
