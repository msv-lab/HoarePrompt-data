Postcondition: ***After the if-else block execution, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2, and i remain unchanged. If B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to y1, the program terminates immediately without any changes. Otherwise, after all loop iterations, i is incremented by 2m, B[i][1] is assigned y1, x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j], and the set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. Additionally, x1 is not equal to x2 and x1 is not equal to y2.***
