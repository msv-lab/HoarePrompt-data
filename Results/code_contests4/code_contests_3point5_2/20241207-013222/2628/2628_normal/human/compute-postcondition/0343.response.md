Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 2m. The values of B[i][0] and B[i][1] are updated based on the conditions within the loop. The final state of the program variables depends on the specific conditions met during execution.**
