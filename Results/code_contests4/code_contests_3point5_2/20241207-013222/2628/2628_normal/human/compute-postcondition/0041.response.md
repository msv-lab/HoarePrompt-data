Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of the first element in list A is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same. `j` is incremented by 1. The values at index `j` of list B are assigned to `x2` and `y2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values at index `j` in list `B.
Output State: **`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values at index `j` in list `B.**
