Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, while the previous values of the variables are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: x1 is updated, y1 is updated, x2 is assigned the value of `a[j]`, y2 is assigned the value of `a[j]`, B[i][0] is incremented by 1, B[i][1] is updated to the value of `y1`.
Output State: **x1 is updated, y1 is updated, x2 is assigned the value of `a[j]`, y2 is assigned the value of `a[j]`, B[i][0] is incremented by 1, B[i][1] is updated to the value of `y1`**
