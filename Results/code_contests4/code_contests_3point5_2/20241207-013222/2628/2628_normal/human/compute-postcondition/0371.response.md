Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 remain unchanged. The values of B[i][0] and B[i][1] are modified based on the conditions within the loop. If the sum of A[i][0] for i in range(n) is equal to 1 or the sum of B[i][0] for i in range(m) is equal to 1, the value of `ans` will depend on the elements of list B. If neither condition is met, the loop will either print -1 and exit or increment B[i][0] and assign a new value to B[i][1].***
