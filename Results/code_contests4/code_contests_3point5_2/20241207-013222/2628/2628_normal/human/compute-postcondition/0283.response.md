Postcondition: ***Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, then -1 is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.***
