Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers. If `A[i][1] != 0` and `A[i][1] != y1`, then the i-th list remains unchanged, and -1 is printed. Otherwise, the first element of the i-th list is incremented by 1, and the values of `x1` and `y1` are updated accordingly.***
