Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m remain the same. i is incremented by 2. j is less than m+1. x2 is assigned the value of b[j] and y2 is assigned the value of b[j]. If A[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to y1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, A[i][0] is incremented by 1 and A[i][1] is assigned the value of y1.***
