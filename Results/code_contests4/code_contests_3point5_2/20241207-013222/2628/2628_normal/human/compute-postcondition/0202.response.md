Example Answer:
`x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. The values of `a[j]` are unknown, so `x2` and `y2` will take on those values. `B[i][0]` should be incremented by 1, so the first element of the `i`th row in matrix `B` will be increased by 1. `B[i][1]` should be assigned the value of `y1`, but the value of `y1` is unknown in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, i, m remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`, B[i][0] is incremented by 1, and B[i][1] is assigned the value of `y1`.
Output State: **Values of A, i, m remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`, B[i][0] is incremented by 1, and B[i][1] is assigned the value of `y1`**
