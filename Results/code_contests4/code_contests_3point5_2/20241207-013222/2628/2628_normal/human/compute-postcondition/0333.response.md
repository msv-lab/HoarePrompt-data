Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, where `x1` is updated. The states of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `B[i][0]`, and `B[i][1]` are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1` is updated, `y1` is updated, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is `n+1`, `B[i][1]` is updated to the value of `x1`.
Output State: **`x1` is updated, `y1` is updated, `x2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `a[j]`, `B[i][0]` is `n+1`, `B[i][1]` is updated to the value of `x1`**
