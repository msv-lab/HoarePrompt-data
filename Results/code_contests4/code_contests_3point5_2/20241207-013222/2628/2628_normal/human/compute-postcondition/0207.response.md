Postcondition: ***Values of A, i, m remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`. If `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Otherwise, if `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. In both cases, -1 is printed.***
