Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 will remain the same as their initial values. i is incremented by 1. x1 and y1 are assigned the values of a[i]. j is less than m. x2 and y2 are assigned the values of b[j]. If A[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to y1, then the function continues without updating A[i][1]. If A[i][1] is equal to y1, then the function updates A[i][1] to be equal to y1.***
