Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of the i-th list in list `A`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from list `b` based on index 0. The set of elements in the i-th list of `A` is not equal to the set of elements in list `b` at index 0.***
