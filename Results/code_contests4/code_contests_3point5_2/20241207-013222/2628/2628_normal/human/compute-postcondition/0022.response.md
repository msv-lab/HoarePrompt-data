Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `B` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x1` is 0, `y1` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from the inner list in `B` at index `j`. The set of elements in the inner list at index `i` in `A` is not equal to the set of elements in the inner list at index `j` in `B`. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`. Moreover, after entering the if condition, either `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`. Moreover, `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and `A[i][1]` is not equal to `y1`.***
