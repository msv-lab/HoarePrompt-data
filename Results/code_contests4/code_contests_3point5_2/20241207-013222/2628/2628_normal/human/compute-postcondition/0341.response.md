Postcondition: ***x1, y1, x2, y2 are updated. If B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to x1, then x1, y1, x2, y2 are updated, B[i][0] is incremented by 1, B[i][1] is updated based on the conditions, and -1 is printed. If B[i][1] is equal to 0 or equal to x1, then x1, y1, x2, y2 are updated, B[i][0] is incremented to n+1, and B[i][1] is updated to the value of x1. If B[i][1] is equal to 0 or equal to y1, then x1, y1, x2, y2 are updated, B[i][0] is incremented by 1. If y1 is equal to x2 or y2, B[i][1] is updated based on the conditions. If B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and not equal to y1, then -1 is printed, and B[i][1] is updated based on the conditions. If B[i][1] is either 0 or equal to y1, then B[i][1] is updated to the value of y1.***
