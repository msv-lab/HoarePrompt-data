Example Answer:
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. According to the postcondition, `x1` is either `x2` or `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is equal to `0` or `x1`. Therefore, after execution, `B[i][1]` can be `0` or `x1`, and `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or x1**
