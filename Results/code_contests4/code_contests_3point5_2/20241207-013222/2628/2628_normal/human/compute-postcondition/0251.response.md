Example Answer:
The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 1. B[i][0] is updated based on the condition stated. x1, y1 are assigned the values of b[i] and x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. Additionally, x1 is not equal to x2 and y2. The condition (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2) is true. The condition (B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == y1) is true.
