Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `j` are all incremented by 1. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values at index `j` in list `B. Otherwise, if `A[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, then the inner list at index `i` has its first element incremented by 1, `i`, `n` are incremented by 1, `x1` is assigned to the second element of the inner list at index `i`, `y1`, `m`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values at index `j` in list `B.***
