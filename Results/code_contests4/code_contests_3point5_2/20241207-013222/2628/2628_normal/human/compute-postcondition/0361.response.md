According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable B. If B is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, B must not be empty, and if the first element of Bi is equal to 1, then `ans` is set to 1.
