Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of the variables `A`, `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` will remain the same as their initial values. `i` is incremented by 1. `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`. `j` is less than `m`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. The sets of elements in `a[i]` and `b[j]` are not equal. If `(x1 == x2 or x1 == y2) and A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != x1`, the program state satisfies the mentioned conditions. Otherwise, if `(x1 != x2 and x1 != y2) and (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2) and (A[i][1] != 0 and A[i][1] != y1)`, the program will execute the else part. Additionally, after executing the if else block, the value of `A[i][0]` might be incremented by 1.***
