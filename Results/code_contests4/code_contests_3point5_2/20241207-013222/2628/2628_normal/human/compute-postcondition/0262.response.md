Output State: **Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. `i` is now incremented by 1. `B[i][0]` remains unchanged. `B[i][1]` is updated to be equal to `x1`, where `x1` is the value of `b[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. `x1` and `y1` have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged.**
