Example Answer:
The value of `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, which remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m remain the same. i is incremented by 2. j is less than m+1. x2 is assigned the value of b[j] and y2 is assigned the value of b[j]. A[i][0] is incremented by 1. `A[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.
