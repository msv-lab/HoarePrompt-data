Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of the i-th list in list `A`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from list `b` based on index 0. The set of elements in the i-th list of `A` is not equal to the set of elements in list `b` at index 0. After the if else block, if `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2` and (A[i][1] = 0 or A[i][1] = x1), then the program continues execution. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, then the program executes `print(-1)`. Otherwise, if none of the conditions are met, `A[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `A[i][1]` is either `x2` or `y2`.***
