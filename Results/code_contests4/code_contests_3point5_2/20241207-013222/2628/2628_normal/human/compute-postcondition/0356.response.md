Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 remain unchanged. The values of B[i][0] and B[i][1] are modified based on the conditions within the loop. If Ai[0] equals 1 for any Ai in A, then `ans` will be assigned the value of the first Ai[1] where Ai[0] is 1.**
