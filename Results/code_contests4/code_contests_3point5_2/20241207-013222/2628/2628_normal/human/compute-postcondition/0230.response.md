Postcondition: ***Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]`. If `set(b[i])` is not equal to `set(a[j])`, the following occurs: if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`. If the condition in the if statement is false, then if `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, -1 is printed. If `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `y1`, `B[i][0]` is increased by 1 and `B[i][1]` is assigned an unknown value `y1`.***
