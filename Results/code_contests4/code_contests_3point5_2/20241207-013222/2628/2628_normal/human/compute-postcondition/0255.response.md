Postcondition: ***Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 1. B[i][0] and B[i][1] are updated based on conditions within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, i must be less than m. x1, y1 are assigned the values of b[i] and x2, y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. The set of elements in b[i] is not equal to the set of elements in a[j]. If x1 is equal to x2 or x1 is equal to y2, and B[i][1] is not equal to 0 and B[i][1] is not equal to x1, no variables are changed. If x1 is not equal to x2 and y2 and (y1 == x2 or y1 == y2), and B[i][1] != 0 and B[i][1] != y1, `print(-1)` is executed. If B[i][1] == 0 or B[i][1] == y1, B[i][1] is assigned the value of y1.***
