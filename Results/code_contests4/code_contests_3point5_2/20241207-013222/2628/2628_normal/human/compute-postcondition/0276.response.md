The value of `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`.
Output State: **Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`.**
