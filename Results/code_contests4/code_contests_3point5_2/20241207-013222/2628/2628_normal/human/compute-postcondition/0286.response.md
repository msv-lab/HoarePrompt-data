Postcondition: ***Values of A, n, x1, y1 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. `x2, y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. If the set of elements in `b[i]` is not equal to the set of elements in `a[j]`, the program checks for specific conditions involving `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `B[i][1]`. If certain conditions are met, specific actions are taken. If the conditions are not met, the program continues without any changes.***
