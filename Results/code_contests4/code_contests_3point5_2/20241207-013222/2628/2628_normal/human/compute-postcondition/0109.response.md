Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of the i-th list in list `A`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from list `b` based on index 1. If `A[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `x1` is assigned the value of the i-th list in list `A`, `y1`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from list `b` based on index 1.***
