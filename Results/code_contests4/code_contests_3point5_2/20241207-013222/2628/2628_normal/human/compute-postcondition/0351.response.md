Example Answer:
If `Ai[0]` equals 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of `Ai[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the values of the variables A, i, n, x1, y1, m, j, x2, and y2 remain unchanged. The values of B[i][0] and B[i][1] are modified based on the conditions within the loop. If `Ai[0]` equals 1, then `ans` is assigned the value of `Ai[1` and the program state is such that `Ai[0]` is 1 and the rest of the variables remain unchanged for the next iteration.
