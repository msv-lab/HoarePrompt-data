Postcondition: ***After executing the code, x2 and y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. If set(b[i]) is not equal to set(a[j]), the state of the program will be as follows: If B[i][1] is neither 0 nor equal to x1, then x2 and y2 will retain the values of a[j]. If B[i][1] is either 0 or equal to x1, then B[i][0] will be incremented by 1, x2 and y2 will be assigned the values of a[j], and B[i][1] will be assigned the value of x1. Similarly, if B[i][1] is neither 0 nor equal to y1, then x2 and y2 will retain the values of a[j]. If B[i][1] is either 0 or equal to y1, then B[i][0] will be incremented by 1, x2 and y2 will be assigned the values of a[j], and B[i][1] will be assigned the value of y1.***
