Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the inner list at index `i` in `A` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the first element at index `i` in `A` is either 0 or incremented by 1, and the second element is either 0 or equal to `y1`. `B` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros. `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` retain their initial values.***
