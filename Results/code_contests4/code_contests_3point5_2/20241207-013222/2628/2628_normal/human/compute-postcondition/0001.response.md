Example Answer:
The code snippet reads two integers from input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')` and stores them in a list `a` after converting them to integers. Since the values are within the range of 1 to 9, the integers are distinct. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12. The pairs of numbers communicated from participants are distinct and each pair consists of two different numbers from 1 to 9.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12. The pairs of numbers communicated from participants are distinct and each pair consists of two different numbers from 1 to 9.**
