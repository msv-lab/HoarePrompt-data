Example Answer: 
`B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`, but the previous values of `B[i][0]`, `x2`, and `y2` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j] and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`.
Output State: **`B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j] and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`**
