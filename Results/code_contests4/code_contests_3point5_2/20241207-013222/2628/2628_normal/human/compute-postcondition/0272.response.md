According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the conditions related to `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and the values in the list `B`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1. 

If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the program prints -1 and exits. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, the loop continues. If `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `x1`, then the loop continues. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the loop continues if `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `y1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the values need to be adjusted based on the conditions within the loop. `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]` are updated according to the loop conditions. `x1` and `y1` are updated based on the loop conditions. `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged. The loop executes until `i` is less than `m`.

State: **Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1.**
