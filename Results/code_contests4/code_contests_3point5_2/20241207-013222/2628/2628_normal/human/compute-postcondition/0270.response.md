Postcondition: ***Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, the program prints -1 and exits if `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`. If `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `x1`, then the loop continues. If `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2`, the loop continues if `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `y1`. For each iteration, `B[i][0]` and `B[i][1]` are updated according to the conditions within the loop. `x1` and `y1` are updated based on the loop conditions. `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged. The loop executes until `i` is less than `m`.***
