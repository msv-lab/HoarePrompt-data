Output State: **`A` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `B` is a list of lists with each inner list containing two zeros, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x1` is 0, `y1` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from the inner list in `B` at index `j`. The set of elements in the inner list at index `i` in `A` is not equal to the set of elements in the inner list at index `j` in `B`. Either x1 is equal to x2 or x1 is equal to y2. Moreover, the value at index 1 in the inner list at index `i` in `A` is not 0 and is not equal to x1; -1 is printed.**
