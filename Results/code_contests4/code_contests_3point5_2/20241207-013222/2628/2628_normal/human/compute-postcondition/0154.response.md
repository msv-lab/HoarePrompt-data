Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of the variables `A`, `i`, `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `m`, `j`, `x2`, and `y2` will remain the same as their initial values. `i` is incremented by 1. `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `a[i]`. `j` is less than `m`. `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `b[j]`. `A[i][1]` is updated to be equal to `y1`.**
