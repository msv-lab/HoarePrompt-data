Postcondition: ***Values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. If `B[i][1]` is not 0 and not equal to `x1`, then the loop does not execute anymore, `x1` and `y1` remain unchanged, `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged. The program prints -1 and exits. If `B[i][1]` is 0 or equal to `x1`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `B[i][0]` remains unchanged, `B[i][1]` is updated to be equal to `x1`, `x1` and `y1` have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. `x2` and `y2` remain unchanged.***
