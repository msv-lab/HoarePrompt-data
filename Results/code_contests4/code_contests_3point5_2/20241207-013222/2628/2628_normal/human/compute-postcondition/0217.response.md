Example Answer: 
The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `a[j]`. The variables `A`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged. The updated values of `x2` and `y2` are dependent on the value of `a[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged; `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]`.
Output State: **Values of `A`, `i`, `m` remain unchanged; `x2` and `y2` are updated based on `a[j]**.
