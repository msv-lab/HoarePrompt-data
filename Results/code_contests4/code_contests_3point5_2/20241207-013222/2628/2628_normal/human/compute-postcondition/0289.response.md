Example Answer:
The values of x1 and y1 are assigned the values of B[i]. The values of A, n, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 2m. B[i][0] and B[i][1] are updated based on the conditions within the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 2m. B[i][0] and B[i][1] are updated based on the conditions within the loop.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of A, n, x1, y1, x2, y2 remain unchanged. i is incremented by 2m. B[i][0] and B[i][1] are updated based on the conditions within the loop.**
