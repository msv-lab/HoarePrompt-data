Postcondition: ***After executing the code, x2 and y2 are assigned the values of a[j]. If B[i][1] is not 0 and not equal to x1, then x2 and y2 retain the values of a[j]. Otherwise, x2 and y2 are still assigned the values of a[j], B[i][0] is incremented by 1, and B[i][1] is assigned the value of x1.***
