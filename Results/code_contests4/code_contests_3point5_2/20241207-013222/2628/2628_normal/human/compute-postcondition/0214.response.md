Postcondition: ***Values of A, i, m remain unchanged. `x2` and `y2` are updated to the values of `a[j]`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `x1`, then `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` or `x1` is equal to `y2`, and `B[i][1]` is equal to 0 or equal to `x1`, then `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `x1`, and -1 is printed. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` and `x1` is not equal to `y2`, `B[i][0]` is incremented by 1, and `B[i][1]` is assigned the value of `y1`. Additionally, if `y1` is equal to `x2` or `y1` is equal to `y2` and `B[i][1]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `y1`, the program exits; otherwise, it continues with the updated values.***
