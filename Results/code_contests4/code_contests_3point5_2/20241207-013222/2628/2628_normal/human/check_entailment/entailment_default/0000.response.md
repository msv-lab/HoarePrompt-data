Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description. It reads pairs of numbers from participants, processes them according to specific constraints, and prints the result. The function checks if there is a unique number in each list of pairs. If there is a unique number in either list, it prints that number. If there is no unique number, it prints 0. The function exits with -1 if certain conditions are not met during processing. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality. Thus, the code is correct.
