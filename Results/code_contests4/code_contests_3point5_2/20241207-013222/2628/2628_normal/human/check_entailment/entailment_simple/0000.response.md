Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through the pairs communicated by each participant, checking for common numbers. It keeps track of the number of times a number appears in the pairs and finally deduces the shared number if it can be determined with certainty. Otherwise, it returns 0 or -1 as specified in the problem description. The program covers all possible cases and outputs the correct result accordingly.
