Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because there is a typo in the code. The condition `elif inp == 'WISKEY':` should be `elif inp == 'WHISKEY':` to match the list of alcohol drinks provided in the problem description. This typo would lead to incorrect counting of people who should be checked.
