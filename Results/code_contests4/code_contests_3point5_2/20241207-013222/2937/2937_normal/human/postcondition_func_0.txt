The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and then processes a list of `n` visitor entries. Each visitor entry consists of an age (an integer from 0 to 1000) and a drink (a string of capital Latin letters from 1 to 100 in length). The function checks if the drink is classified as alcohol and if the age is under 18. It increments a counter `res` for each visitor entry that meets these conditions. Finally, the function prints the total count of visitors who meet the specified conditions. However, there is a potential missing functionality in the code. The code does not handle cases where the input drink is not of the specified alcohol types, potentially leading to inaccurate results. This missing logic could affect the overall functionality of the function.
