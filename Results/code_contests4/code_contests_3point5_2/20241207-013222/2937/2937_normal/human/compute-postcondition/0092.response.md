Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the updated `res` will be `res + 1`. The values of `rep`, `n`, and `inp` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `rep` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value, `inp` is assigned the value of raw_input().
Output State: **`res` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `rep` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value, `inp` is assigned the value of raw_input()**
