Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `res` can be 0 or 1, so after execution, `res` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `rep`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value.
Output State: **`res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value**
