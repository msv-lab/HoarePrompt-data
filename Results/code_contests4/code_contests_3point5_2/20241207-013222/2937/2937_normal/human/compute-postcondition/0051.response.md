Postcondition: ***`res` is either 0 or 1, `rep` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `inp` is assigned a specific value. If `inp` is 'ABSINTH', then `res` is 1, `rep` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0. If `inp` is 'BEER' or 'BRANDY', then `res` is 1, `rep` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or any other value not specified, and the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `res` is 1, `rep` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0.***
