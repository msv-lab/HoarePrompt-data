Postcondition: ***`res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `inp` is 'GIN', then the function sets `res` to 1 and `rep` remains at 0, with `n` still greater than 0. If `inp` is 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or any value other than 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA' and the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `res` is set to 1 and `rep` remains at 0, with `n` still greater than 0.***
