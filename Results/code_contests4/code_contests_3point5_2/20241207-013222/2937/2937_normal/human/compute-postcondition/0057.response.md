Example Answer: 
`res` is incremented by 1, so if the previous value of `res` is 0, after execution `res` will be 1, and if the previous value of `res` is 1, after execution `res` will be 2. The values of `rep`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value.
Output State: **`res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value**
