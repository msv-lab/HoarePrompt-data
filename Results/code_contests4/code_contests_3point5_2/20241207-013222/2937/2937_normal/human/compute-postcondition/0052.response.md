Postcondition: ***`res` is either 0 or 1, `rep` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `inp` is assigned a specific value. If the first character of `inp` is a digit between 0 and 9 and the integer value of `inp` is less than 18, then `res` is 1 and `rep` is 0. If `inp` is 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', or 'BRANDY', then `res` is 1, `rep` remains 0, and `n` is still greater than 0. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or any other value not specified, and the first character of `inp` is not a digit, then `res` is 1, `rep` remains 0, and `n` is still greater than 0.***
