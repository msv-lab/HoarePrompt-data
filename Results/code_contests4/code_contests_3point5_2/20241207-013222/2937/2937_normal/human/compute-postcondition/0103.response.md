Postcondition: ***`res`, `rep`, `n`, `inp` are variables. If `inp` is 'BRANDY', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', `res` is incremented by 1. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', 'WISKEY', or 'WINE', then the program executes the specified conditions as per the else part. `rep` remains 2, `n` remains greater than 0, and `inp` retains the specific string value as assigned.***
