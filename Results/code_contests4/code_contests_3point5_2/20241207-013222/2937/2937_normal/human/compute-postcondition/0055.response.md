Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `res + 1`, where `res` can be either 0 or 1. Adding 1 to 0 results in 1, and adding 1 to 1 results in 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value.
Output State: **`res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value**
