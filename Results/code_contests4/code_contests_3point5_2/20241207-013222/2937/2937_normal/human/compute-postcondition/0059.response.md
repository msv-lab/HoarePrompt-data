Example Answer: 
`res` is incremented by 1, where `res` can be 0 or 1. After execution, `res` becomes either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value.
Output State: **`res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value**
