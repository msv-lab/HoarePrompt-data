The functionality of the function is to process information about visitors, where each visitor has an age (an integer from 0 to 1000) and a drink (a string of capital Latin letters from 1 to 100 in length). The function should only consider drinks that are classified as alcohol. The function should then analyze the age and drink of each visitor and return some output based on this information.
