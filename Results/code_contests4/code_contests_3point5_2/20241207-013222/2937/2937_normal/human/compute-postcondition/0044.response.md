Postcondition: ***`res` is 1, `rep` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `inp` is 'TEQUILA', then the function sets `res` to 1 and keeps `rep` at 0, with `n` remaining greater than 0. If `inp` is 'VODKA' or any value not equal to 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA' and the first character of `inp` is not a digit, the function also sets `res` to 1 and leaves `rep` at 0, with `n` remaining greater than 0.***
