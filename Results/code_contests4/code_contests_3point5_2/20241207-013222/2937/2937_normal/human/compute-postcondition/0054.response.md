Example Answer:
`inp` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes an input as a string. The values of `res`, `rep`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is either 0 or 1, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value.
Output State: **`res` is either 0 or 1, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value**
