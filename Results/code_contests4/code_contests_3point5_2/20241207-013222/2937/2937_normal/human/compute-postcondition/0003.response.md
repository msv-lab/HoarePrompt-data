Example Answer:
`inp` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 0, `rep` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **`res` is 0, `rep` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned the input value**
