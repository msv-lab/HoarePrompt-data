Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1, which means if `res` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `res` was 1, it becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value.
Output State: **`res` is either 1 or 2, `rep` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `inp` is assigned a specific string value**
