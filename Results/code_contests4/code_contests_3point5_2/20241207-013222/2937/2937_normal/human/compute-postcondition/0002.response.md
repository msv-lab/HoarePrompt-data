According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `rep` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `rep` is 0.
State: **`res` is 0, `rep` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
