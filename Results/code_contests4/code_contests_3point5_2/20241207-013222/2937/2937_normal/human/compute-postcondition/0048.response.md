Postcondition: ***`res` is either 1 or 0, `rep` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `inp` is assigned a specific value. If `inp` is 'CHAMPAGNE', then `res` is set to 1, and `rep` remains at 0 with `n` still greater than 0. If `inp` is 'GIN', `res` is set to 1 while `rep` remains 0 with `n` still greater than 0. If `inp` is 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', or any value other than 'ABSINTH', 'BEER', 'BRANDY', 'CHAMPAGNE', 'GIN', 'RUM', 'SAKE', 'TEQUILA', 'VODKA', and the first character of `inp` is not a digit, `res` is set to 1 while `rep` remains 0 with `n` still greater than 0.***
