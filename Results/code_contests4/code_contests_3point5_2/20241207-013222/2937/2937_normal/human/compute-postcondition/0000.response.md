Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer obtained from user input using `raw_input()`. The possible values of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each visitor's age is an integer from 0 to 1000, and each visitor's drink is a string of capital Latin letters from 1 to 100 in length. Only the drinks from the list given in the problem description should be considered alcohol.
