Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input drink is not one of the specified alcohol types. This means that the program may incorrectly count visitors who are not underage and not consuming alcohol as needing to be checked by Vasya. The missing logic affects the overall functionality of the program and does not fully adhere to the problem description.
