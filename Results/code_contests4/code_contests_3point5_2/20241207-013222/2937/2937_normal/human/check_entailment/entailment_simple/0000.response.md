Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. 
1. There is a typo in checking for the drink 'WHISKEY'. The program checks for 'WISKEY' instead of 'WHISKEY'.
2. The program does not handle the case where the visitor's age is given as a string instead of an integer. This case should be considered and the program should check if the input is a digit before converting it to an integer.
3. The program does not handle the case where the input drink is not from the list of alcohol drinks. In this case, the program should not increase the count of people to be checked. 

These issues make the program incorrect as it does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
