Example Answer:
lst is assigned the value of the result of raw_input().split(), which creates a list of strings by splitting the input based on whitespaces. A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, so the values of A, B, and C are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9**
