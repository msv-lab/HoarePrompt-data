Example Answer:
The `reverse()` method reverses the elements of the list `lst`. Since the initial state of the variables A, B, and C is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values after reversing the list. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and the list `lst` has been reversed.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 9, and the list `lst` has been reversed**
