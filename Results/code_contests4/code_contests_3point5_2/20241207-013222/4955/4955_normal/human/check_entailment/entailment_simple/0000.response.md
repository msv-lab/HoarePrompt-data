Correctness: **True**

The program takes three integers as input, sorts them in descending order, calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance according to the problem description, and outputs the result. The program follows the rules outlined in the problem description for all potential cases (1 <= A, B, C <= 9). Therefore, the program is correct.
