Correctness: **True**

The program reads three integers A, B, and C and calculates the sum of the largest two integers multiplied by 10, plus the third integer, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program ensures that the values of A, B, and C are between 1 and 9 by the constraints given in the problem description. The output of the program is the maximum possible amount of the allowance, as required by the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
