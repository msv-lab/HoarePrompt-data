Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads three integers A, B, and C from user input and calculates the sum of the largest two integers multiplied by 10, plus the third integer. The code then prints the result. The code correctly handles the constraints where all values are between 1 and 9. The logic of sorting the integers in descending order and then calculating the formula as described in the problem statement is implemented correctly. Additionally, the code does not have any edge cases or scenarios where it deviates from the problem description. The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
