You have decided to give an allowance to your child depending on the outcome of the game that he will play now.

The game is played as follows:

* There are three "integer panels", each with a digit between 1 and 9 (inclusive) printed on it, and one "operator panel" with a `+` printed on it.
* The player should construct a formula of the form X + Y, by arranging the four panels from left to right. (The operator panel should not be placed at either end of the formula.)
* Then, the amount of the allowance will be equal to the resulting value of the formula.



Given the values A, B and C printed on the integer panels used in the game, find the maximum possible amount of the allowance.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq A, B, C \leq 9
