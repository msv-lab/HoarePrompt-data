Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly takes the input values A, B, and C, sorts them in descending order, calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance using the formula mentioned in the problem description, and prints the result. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case where A, B, and C are integers between 1 and 9, we can conclude that the program is correct.
