Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes three integers as input, sorts them in descending order, calculates the maximum possible amount of the allowance according to the given formula, and then prints the result. The logic in the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases where the input values are between 1 and 9. The program correctly calculates the maximum allowance amount by arranging the integers in descending order and applying the formula. All the provided examples also produce the expected output. Hence, the program is correct.
