Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, it is observed that the code accurately calculates the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n! as described in the problem. The code first reads the integers n and b from the input, then calculates the minimum number of times n can be divided by a prime factor of b, and finally prints the result. The code iterates through the prime factors of b and calculates the number of times n can be divided by each prime factor. It then determines the minimum number of times n can be divided by any prime factor of b, which represents the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!. 

Since the code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints accurately summarize the code functionality, we can conclude that the code is correct.
