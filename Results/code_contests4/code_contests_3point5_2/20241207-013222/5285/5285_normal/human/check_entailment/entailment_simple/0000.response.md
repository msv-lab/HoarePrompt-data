Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!. It follows the problem description by first finding the prime factors of the base b, then calculating the number of trailing zeros in the b-ary representation of n! based on these factors. The program iterates through all prime factors, calculates the number of times each factor can divide n!, and then finds the minimum value of these divisions.

Overall, the program implements the required logic to solve the problem as described in the problem description.
