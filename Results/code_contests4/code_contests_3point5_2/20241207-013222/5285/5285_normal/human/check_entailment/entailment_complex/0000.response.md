Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads two integers `n` and `b`, calculates the minimum number of times `n` can be divided by a prime factor of `b`, and prints the result. The program iterates through the prime factors of `b`, calculates the number of times `n` can be divided by each factor, and keeps track of the minimum value. Finally, it prints the minimum number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!. 

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the given inputs.
