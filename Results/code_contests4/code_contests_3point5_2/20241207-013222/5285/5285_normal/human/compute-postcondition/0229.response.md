According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `st` is greater than 0, and `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1). Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to ensure that `newn` is greater than `(2^st - 1)` raised to the power of `st`.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), for the loop to execute the first time then newn is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of st**
