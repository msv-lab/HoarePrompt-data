According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1 for each iteration of the loop. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st` for the loop to execute the first time.
2. `newizv` should be updated according to the loop body description.
3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1 for each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute the first time then `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
