According to the code, the loop will execute `st` number of times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `st` needs to be greater than 0. All other variables retain their initial values. 

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers with their initial values, if `st` is equal to 0 then `st` is also 0**
