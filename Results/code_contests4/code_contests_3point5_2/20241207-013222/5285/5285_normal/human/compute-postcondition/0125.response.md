According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, so it depends on the value of `newk`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newizv` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` is such that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
