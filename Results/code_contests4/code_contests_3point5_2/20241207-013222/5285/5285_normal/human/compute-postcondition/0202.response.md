Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The values of `st`, `newk`, and `newizv` are not provided, so the specific value of `newn` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is updated, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`**
