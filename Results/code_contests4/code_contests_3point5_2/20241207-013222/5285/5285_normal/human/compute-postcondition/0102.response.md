Postcondition: ***`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 0, `newizv` is now 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0. If `st` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
