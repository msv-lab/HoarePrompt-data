According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` has been updated, `newk` is less than 2^st - 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newnewk` is 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
2. No other states need adjustment.

State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` has been updated, `newk` is less than 2^st - 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newnewk` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
