Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` needs to be incremented by 1, `newizv` needs to be updated, `izv` is incremented by the new value of `newizv`, `newn` needs to be updated for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`st` needs to be incremented by 1, `newizv` needs to be updated, `izv` is incremented by the new value of `newizv`, `newn` needs to be updated for the loop to execute again**
