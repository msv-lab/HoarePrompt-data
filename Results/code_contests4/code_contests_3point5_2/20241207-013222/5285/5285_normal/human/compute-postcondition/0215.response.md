According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is the squared value of `newk`, `newk` is greater than `newn`, and `newn` is less than or equal to the squared value of `newk`. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be less than the squared value of `newk`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is the squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, `newk` is greater than `newn`, `newn` is less than the squared value of `newk` for the loop to execute again**
