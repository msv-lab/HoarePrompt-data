According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by 1, `res`, `mlt`, `newizv` is doubled and incremented by 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by 2, `res`, `mlt`, `newizv` is doubled and incremented by 1**
