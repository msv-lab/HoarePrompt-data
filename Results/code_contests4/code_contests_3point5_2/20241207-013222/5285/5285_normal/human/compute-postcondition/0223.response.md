Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` is dependent on its initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `newizv` are all integers, if `st` is equal to 0, then all variables retain their initial values and the loop or if statement breaks, `newizv` is updated based on its previous value.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `newizv` are all integers, if `st` is equal to 0, then all variables retain their initial values and the loop or if statement breaks, `newizv` is updated based on its previous value**
