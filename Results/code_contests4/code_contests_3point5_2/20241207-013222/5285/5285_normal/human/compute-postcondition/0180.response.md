According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newn`, `st` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`, and `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted: `newnewk` must be less than `newn` and `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`.
State: **`newn`, `st` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`, `newnewk` is less than `newn` and `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
