Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value 2. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2**
