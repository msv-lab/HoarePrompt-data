According to the code, the loop can execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newizv` is 0 and `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`. Additionally, `st` needs to be increased by 1 to indicate that the loop has executed at least once.
State: **`newn`, `st` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
