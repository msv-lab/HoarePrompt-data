Example Answer:
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `st` is greater than 0, so after execution, `st` will be greater than its previous value. The values of `newnewk` and `newk` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, `newk` is greater than `newn` for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`newnewk` is squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, `newk` is greater than `newn` for the loop to execute the first time**
