According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 0 and `newn` is 0. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `newn` needs to be greater than or equal to 1.
- `newk` should be adjusted to have a value greater than 0.
- `newnewk` should be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

State: **`st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is greater than or equal to 1, `newk` is greater than 0, `i` is less than 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`**
