According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 2, `newnewk` is 0**
