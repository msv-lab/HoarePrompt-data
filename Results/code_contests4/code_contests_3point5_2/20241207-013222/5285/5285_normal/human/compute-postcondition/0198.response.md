Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, so the output state is: `newn` is updated, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`newn` is updated, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv` for the loop to execute again**
