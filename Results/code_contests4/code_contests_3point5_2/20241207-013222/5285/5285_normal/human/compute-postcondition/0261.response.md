According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `st` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1 so `i` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 3.
State: **`st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 3, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 3, `newnewk` is 0**
