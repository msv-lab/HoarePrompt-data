According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `st` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `st` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. 
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `newizv` are all integers, if `st` is equal to 0, then all variables retain their initial values and the loop or if statement breaks**
