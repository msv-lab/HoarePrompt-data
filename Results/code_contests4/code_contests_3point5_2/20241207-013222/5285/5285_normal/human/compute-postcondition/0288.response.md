According to the code, the loop can certainly execute one more time since it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted and the program state can be repeated right before the loop.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is `2^st - 1`, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, the loop has finished executing, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, and `mlt` is less than `res`**
