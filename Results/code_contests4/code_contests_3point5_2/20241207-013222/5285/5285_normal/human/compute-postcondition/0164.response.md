According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `d_osn`. If `k` is less than the length of `d_osn` list, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newn`, `newk`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `mlt` are integers. If `res` == -1, the values remain unchanged. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to `mlt`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`newn`, `newk`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `mlt` remain unchanged. If `res` == -1, then `res` is the integer division result of `izv` divided by `d_osn[k]`. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to `mlt`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than the length of `d_osn`.**
