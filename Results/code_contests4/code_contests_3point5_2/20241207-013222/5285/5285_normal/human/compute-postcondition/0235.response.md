According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows:
- `st` is greater than 0
- `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1)
- `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1)
- `newn` is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of `st`
- `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`
- For the loop to execute again, `newn` is greater than the new value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- Update `newn` to be greater than `newk ** st`
- Further update `newn` by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1), `newn` is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than the new value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is further updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
