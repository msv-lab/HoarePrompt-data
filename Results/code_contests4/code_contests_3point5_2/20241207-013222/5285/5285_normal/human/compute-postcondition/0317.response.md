Output State: `st` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `izv` is the sum of its previous value and `newizv`, `newn` is equal to the result of `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute again `st` should be increased by 1 and `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`.
