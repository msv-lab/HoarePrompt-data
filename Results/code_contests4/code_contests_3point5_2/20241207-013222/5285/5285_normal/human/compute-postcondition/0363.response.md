According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is 0, `newn` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `newn` should be greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is less than 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`**
