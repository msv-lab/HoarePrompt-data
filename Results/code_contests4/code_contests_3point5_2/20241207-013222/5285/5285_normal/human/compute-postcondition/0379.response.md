Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv` multiplied by 2 and incremented by 1. The previous value of `newizv` is doubled and incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by 1, `res`, `mlt`, `newizv` is doubled and incremented by 1.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by 1, `res`, `mlt`, `newizv` is doubled and incremented by 1**
