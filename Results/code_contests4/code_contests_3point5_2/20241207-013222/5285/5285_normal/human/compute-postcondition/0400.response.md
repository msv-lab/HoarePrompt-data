Postcondition: ***`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is calculated by multiplying the initial value by 2 and adding 1 `st` times, `izv` is the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newn` is 0, `newk` remains the same, `i` is equal to `st`, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, `mlt` is assigned the value of the floor division of `izv` by `d_osn[k]`, `res` is not equal to -1, and `res` is assigned the value of `mlt` if `mlt` is less than `res`.***
