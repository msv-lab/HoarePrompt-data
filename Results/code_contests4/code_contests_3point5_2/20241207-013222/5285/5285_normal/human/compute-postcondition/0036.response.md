Postcondition: ***`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1. If `b` is divisible by `cur`, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1. If `cur` is 2, the variables remain the same. If `cur` is not 2, `cur` is increased by 2.***
