According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values (doubled and added 1), and `st` is equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values (doubled and added 1), and `st` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute a second time**
