Example Answer: 
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`. As `newnewk` was initially assigned the value of `newk`, the new value of `newnewk` will be the square of the previous value of `newk`. The conditions on `st` and `newn` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is greater than `newn` for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`newnewk` is squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is greater than `newn` for the loop to execute the first time**
