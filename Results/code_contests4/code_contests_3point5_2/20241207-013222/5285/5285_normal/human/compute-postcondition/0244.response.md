According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is 0, `newn` is 1. Since `newn` is 1, the loop can certainly execute one time, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is 1**
