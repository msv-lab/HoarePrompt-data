According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `st` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `st` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` is irrelevant to the loop execution, so it can remain unchanged. 
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is 0**
