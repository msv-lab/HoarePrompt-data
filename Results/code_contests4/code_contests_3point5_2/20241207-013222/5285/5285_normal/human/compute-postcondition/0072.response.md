According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
