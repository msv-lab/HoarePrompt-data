According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is the squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, and `newk` is greater than `newn`. The condition `newk` is greater than `newn` for the loop to execute the first time implies that `newn` is less than `newk`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `newn` must be less than or equal to the squared value of `newk`.
State: **`newnewk` is squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, `newk` is greater than `newn` and for the loop to execute one more time `newn` is less than or equal to the squared value of `newk`**
