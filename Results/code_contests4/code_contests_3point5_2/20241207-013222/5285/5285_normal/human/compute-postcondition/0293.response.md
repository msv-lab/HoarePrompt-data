According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` and `newn` is equal to `n`. To make the loop execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to be less than `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is less than `newn`, the loop has finished executing, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
