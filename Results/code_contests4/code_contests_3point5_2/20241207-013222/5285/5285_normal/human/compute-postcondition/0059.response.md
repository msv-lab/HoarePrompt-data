Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, so the value of `newnewk` is updated accordingly. The loop will continue to execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. The value of `st` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is increased by 1, loop continues as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is increased by 1, loop continues as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
