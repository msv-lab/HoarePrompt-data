Output State: **`newn`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `mlt` remain unchanged. If `res` == -1, then `res` is the integer division result of `izv` divided by `d_osn[k]`. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to `mlt`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than the length of `d_osn`. `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, and `izv` is assigned the value 0, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`.**
