According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 1, `newizv` is 1, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0**
