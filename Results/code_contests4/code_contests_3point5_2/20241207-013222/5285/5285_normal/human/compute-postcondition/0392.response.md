Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are all updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is the sum of all `newizv` values, `newn` is such that `newn <= newk ** st`, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, the loop does not execute because the condition `newn > newk ** st` is not satisfied**
