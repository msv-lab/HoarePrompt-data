Example Answer: 
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. This means `newn` will have a new value after the calculation. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` has been updated, `newk` is less than 2^st - 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newnewk` is 0.
Output State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` is equal to 2^st - 1, `newn` has been updated, `newk` is less than 2^st - 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newnewk` is 0**
