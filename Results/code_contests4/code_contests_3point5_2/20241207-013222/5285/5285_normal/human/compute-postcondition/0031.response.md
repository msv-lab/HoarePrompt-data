Example Answer:
After the code `b /= cur` is executed, the value of `b` is divided by the current value of `cur`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. The `d_osn[cur]` array will be updated based on whether `b` was divisible by `cur`. The value of `cur` will change based on the condition specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1**
