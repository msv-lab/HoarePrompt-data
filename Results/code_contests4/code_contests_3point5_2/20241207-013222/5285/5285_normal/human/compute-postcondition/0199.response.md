Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The value of `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. After looping `st` times, `newk` is updated. The loop will execute again if `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. 
Output State: **`newn` is updated, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv` for the loop to execute again**
