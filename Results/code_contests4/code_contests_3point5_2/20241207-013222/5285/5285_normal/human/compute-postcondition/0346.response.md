Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if statement, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is updated to a new value, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0 after the loop finishes, and `st` is equal to 1.
Output State: **After the execution of the if statement, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is updated to a new value, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0 after the loop finishes, and `st` is equal to 1**
