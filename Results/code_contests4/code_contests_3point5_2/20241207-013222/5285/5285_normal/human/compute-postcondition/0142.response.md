According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `st` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `st` must be greater than 2.
State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is greater than 2, `newnewk` is 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values (doubled and added 1), and `st` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute a second time**
