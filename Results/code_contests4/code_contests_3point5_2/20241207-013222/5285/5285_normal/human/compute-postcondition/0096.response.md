According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is the next smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`. To execute the loop one more time, `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to the next smallest power of `newk` greater than the current `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by itself, `newnewk` is the next smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is increased by 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is now 0, `izv` remains the same, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is the next smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`**
