According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st`. If `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn` and `st` is the number of times `newnewk` was multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute**
