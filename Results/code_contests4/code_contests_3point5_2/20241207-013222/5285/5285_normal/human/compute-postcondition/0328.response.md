According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is equal to `newk` and `newn` is 0. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to 0, which means `newk` should also be less than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`**
