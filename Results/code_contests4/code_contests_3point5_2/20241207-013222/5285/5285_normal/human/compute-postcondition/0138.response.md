According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `st` is equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `st` is greater than 0. 
State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, and `st` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
