According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newn` is unchanged, `st` is greater than 0 and equal to 0, `newk` is updated to the value obtained after looping `st` times. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `st` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newn` is unchanged, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is updated to the value obtained after looping `st` times, for the loop to execute the first time `st` needs to be greater than 0**
