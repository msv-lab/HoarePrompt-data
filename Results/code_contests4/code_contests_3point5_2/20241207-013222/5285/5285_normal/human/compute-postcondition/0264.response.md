According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, and `st` is equal to `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `newn > newk ** st` needs to be satisfied. Therefore, the values need to be adjusted as follows:
- `newn` needs to be greater than 0
- `newk` needs to be less than `2^st - 1`
- `st` needs to be greater than 0

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` is 0, `newn` is greater than 0, `newk` is less than 2^st - 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newnewk` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
