According to the code, the loop will execute `st` times. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0 and `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` have been updated by doubling their values and adding 1. `izv`, `newn`, `i`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers with their initial values. For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by 1, `res`, `mlt`**
