Example Answer:
`st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0**
