Output State: **`newnewk` is now the square of its previous value, `newnewk` is still the next smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is increased by 2, `i` is 0, `newizv` is now 0, `izv` remains the same, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is the next smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`**
