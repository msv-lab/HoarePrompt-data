According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated to the final value after all iterations, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to the total number of iterations. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `st` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.
2. `newn` needs to be updated to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of the new value of `st`.

State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is one more than the previous value, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of the new value of `st`**
