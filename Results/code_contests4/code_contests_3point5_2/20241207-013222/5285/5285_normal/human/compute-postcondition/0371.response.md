Output State: **`st` is 3, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is greater than or equal to 1, `newk` is greater than 0, `i` is less than 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `newnewk` is further multiplied by `newk` and for the loop to execute again `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is updated by multiplying it with `newk`.**
