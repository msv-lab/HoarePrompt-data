According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newn` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated with the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1` for each iteration, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, and `st` is equal to the number of times the loop executes. 

Therefore, in order for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated with the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1` for each iteration, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values**
