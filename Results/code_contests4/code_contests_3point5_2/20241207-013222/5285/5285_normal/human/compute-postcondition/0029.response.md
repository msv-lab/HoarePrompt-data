According to the code, the loop can execute again if `b` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be met:
1. `b` should be greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1**
