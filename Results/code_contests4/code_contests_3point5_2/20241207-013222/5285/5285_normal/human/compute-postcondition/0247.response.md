According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is 0 and `newn` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and `newnewk` needs to be less than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is 0 for the loop to execute again `newn` is 1, `newnewk` is 0**
