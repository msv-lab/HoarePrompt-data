Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by `newizv`. The value of `newizv` is already calculated as (2^st - 1) in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `izv` will be increased by (2^st - 1). The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1), for the loop to execute the first time then newn is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of st**
