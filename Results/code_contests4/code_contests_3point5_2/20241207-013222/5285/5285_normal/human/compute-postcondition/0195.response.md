Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous value of `izv` is unknown, but it is added to the value of `newizv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is unchanged, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is updated to the value obtained after looping `st` times, for the loop to execute the first time `st` needs to be greater than 0, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is unchanged, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is updated to the value obtained after looping `st` times, for the loop to execute the first time `st` needs to be greater than 0, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`**
