Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is updated by adding all the updated `newizv` values, `newn` is updated to the result of `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute one more time `newn` must be greater than the next power of `newk` after `newn` and `st` must be adjusted accordingly,`izv` is updated by adding `newizv`.**
