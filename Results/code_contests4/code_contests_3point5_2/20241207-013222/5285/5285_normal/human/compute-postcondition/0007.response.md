Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is divided by `cur`, which is 2. If `b` was divisible by `cur` without a remainder, then `d_osn[2]` is incremented by 1. After the division, the value of `b` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`, `cur` is 2.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`, `cur` is 2**
