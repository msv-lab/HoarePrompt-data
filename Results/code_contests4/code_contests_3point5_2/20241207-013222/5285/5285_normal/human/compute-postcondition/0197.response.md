According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the condition `newn > newk ** st` needs to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newn` is updated, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv` for the loop to execute again**.
