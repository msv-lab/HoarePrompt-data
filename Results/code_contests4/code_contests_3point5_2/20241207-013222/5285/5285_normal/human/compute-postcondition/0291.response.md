Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, the loop has finished executing, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, and `mlt` is less than `res`.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, the loop has finished executing, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, and `mlt` is less than `res`**
