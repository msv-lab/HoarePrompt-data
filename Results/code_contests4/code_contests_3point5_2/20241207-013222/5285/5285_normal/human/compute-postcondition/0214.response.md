Example Answer:
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is greater than its previous value, so the new value of `st` is also greater than its previous value. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, `newk` is greater than `newn`, `newn` is less than or equal to the squared value of `newk`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is the squared value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, `newk` is greater than `newn`, `newn` is less than or equal to the squared value of `newk`**
