Output State: **`newnewk` is the value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is the total number of times the loop executed, `newk` is greater than `newn`, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, `newn` is less than `newk`, `i` is 10, `newizv` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
