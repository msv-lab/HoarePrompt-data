Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value. The value of `newk` is 0, and `st` is greater than 0 and is held by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, and `izv` is incremented.
Output State: **`newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, and `izv` is incremented**
