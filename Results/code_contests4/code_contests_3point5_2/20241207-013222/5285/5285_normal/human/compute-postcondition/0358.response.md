According to the code, the loop will execute as it is a `while True` loop. The loop also depends on the variable `i` being less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 10. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is the final value calculated by multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1 `st` number of times, `izv` is the sum of all the updated values of `newizv` during each iteration of the loop, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is 0**
