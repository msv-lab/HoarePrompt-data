Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The value of `izv` is updated based on the previous value of `izv` and the value of `newizv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is updated, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`**
