According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `st` must be greater than 0.
State: **Output State: After the execution of the if statement, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is updated to the new value calculated by multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0 after the loop finishes, and `st` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute the second time `st` must be greater than 0**
