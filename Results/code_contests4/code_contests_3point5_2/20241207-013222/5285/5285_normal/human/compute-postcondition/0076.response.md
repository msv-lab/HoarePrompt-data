Example Answer:
The value of `izv` is updated by adding `newizv` to it. The initial state specifies that `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1 for each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the new value of `izv` will be the sum of all the updated `newizv` values. The conditions for the loop to execute the first time are that `newn` must be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 
Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is updated by adding all the updated `newizv` values.**
