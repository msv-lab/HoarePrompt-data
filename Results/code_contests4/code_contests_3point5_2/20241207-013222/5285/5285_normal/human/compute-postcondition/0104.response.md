Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`. Since the initial value of `newizv` is 0, after execution, `newizv` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 0, `newizv` is 1, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0**
