Postcondition: ***`newn`, `newk`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `mlt` are integers. If `res` == -1, then `newn`, `newk`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `mlt` remain unchanged and `res` is the integer division result of `izv` divided by `d_osn[k]`. If `res` is not equal to -1 and `mlt` is less than `res`, then `res` is updated to `mlt`.***
