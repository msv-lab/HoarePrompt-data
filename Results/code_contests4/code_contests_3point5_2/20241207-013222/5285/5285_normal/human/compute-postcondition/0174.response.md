According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newn`, `st`, `newizv`, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i` remain unchanged, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` needs to be less than or equal to `newn`**
