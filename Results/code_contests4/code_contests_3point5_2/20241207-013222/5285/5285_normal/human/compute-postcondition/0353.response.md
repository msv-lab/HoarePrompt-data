Output State: **`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is updated to the final value calculated by multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1 `st` number of times, `izv` is updated by adding the new value of `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0 after the loop finishes, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
