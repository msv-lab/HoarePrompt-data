According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the previous iteration, `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk` and `st` is increased by 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn` after being multiplied by `newk`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
