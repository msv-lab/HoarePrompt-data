According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `newizv` is updated, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i`, `newnewk` remain unchanged. Since the loop has exited, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `newizv` is updated, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i` is increased by 1, `newnewk` remain unchanged for the loop to execute again**
