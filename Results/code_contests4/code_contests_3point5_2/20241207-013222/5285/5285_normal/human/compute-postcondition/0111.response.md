Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The values of other variables remain the same as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is one more than the previous value, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of the new value of `st`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is one more than the previous value, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of the new value of `st`**
