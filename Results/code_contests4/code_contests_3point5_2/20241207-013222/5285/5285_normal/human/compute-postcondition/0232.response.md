According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk ** st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, which means `newn` has decreased. For the loop to execute one more time, `newn` should be greater than the new value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1), for the loop to execute the first time then `newn` is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than the new value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
