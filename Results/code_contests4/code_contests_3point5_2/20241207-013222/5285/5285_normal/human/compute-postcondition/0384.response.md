Output State: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`.
