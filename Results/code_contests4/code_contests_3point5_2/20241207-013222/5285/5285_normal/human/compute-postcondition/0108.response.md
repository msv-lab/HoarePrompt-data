Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1. Since the initial value of `newizv` is already updated to the new value, we use that updated value. Therefore, after execution, `newizv` will be doubled and increased by 1.  
Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated to the new value after being doubled and increased by 1, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to 1**
