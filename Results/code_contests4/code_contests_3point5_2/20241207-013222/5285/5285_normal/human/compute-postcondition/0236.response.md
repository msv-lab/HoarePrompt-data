Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1) + `izv`, `newn` is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than the new value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is further updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
