According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is increased by 1. Also, `newizv` is updated by multiplying its previous value by 2 and adding 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `st` needs to remain greater than 0, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `newizv` needs to be updated according to the given formula.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `newizv` is updated according to the formula**
