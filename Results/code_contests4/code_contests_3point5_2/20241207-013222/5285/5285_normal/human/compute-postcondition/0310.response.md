According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11, `st` is 11. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 12. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time `st` must be greater than 12.
State: **`st` is greater than 12, `newizv` is 3, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 12, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
