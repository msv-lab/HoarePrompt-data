According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `st` needs to be at least 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated to the new value, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to 1**
