Output State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk` is 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated with the formula newizv = newizv * 2 + 1 for each iteration, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values (doubled and added 1), and `st` is equal to the number of times the loop executes**
