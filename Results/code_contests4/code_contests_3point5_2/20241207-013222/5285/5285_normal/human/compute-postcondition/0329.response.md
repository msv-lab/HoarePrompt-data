Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, where `newnewk` is equal to `newk`, which is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, the output state is: `st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`st` is 0, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0**
