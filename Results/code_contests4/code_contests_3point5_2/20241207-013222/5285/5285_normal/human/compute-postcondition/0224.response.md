According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `st`. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to move to the next iteration. Therefore, the next iteration will have `i` incremented by 1.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by 1, `newizv` is updated based on its previous value**
