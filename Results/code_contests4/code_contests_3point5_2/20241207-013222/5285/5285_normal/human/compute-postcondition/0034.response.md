Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1, `cur` is increased by 2**
