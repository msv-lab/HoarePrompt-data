Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv * 2 + 1`, where `newizv` is 3. After execution, `newizv` becomes 7. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 7, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 3, `newnewk` is 0.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 3, `newizv` is 7, `izv` is 0, `newn` is 1, `newk` is 0, `i` is 3, `newnewk` is 0**
