According to the code, the loop will execute again if `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to the product of `newk` and `newnewk`, and `newnewk` is less than `newn`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `newnewk` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is less than `newn`, the loop has finished executing, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to the product of `newk` and `newnewk`, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
