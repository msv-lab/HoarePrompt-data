Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, where `newnewk` is the squared value of `newk`. Since `newk` is greater than `newn`, and `newn` is less than the squared value of `newk`, the loop will execute again. The values of `newnewk` and `newk` will change based on their previous values. 
Output State: **`newnewk` is the squared value of the new value of `newk`, `st` is greater than its previous value, `newk` is greater than `newn`, `newn` is less than the squared value of the new value of `newk` for the loop to execute again**
