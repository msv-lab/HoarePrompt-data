Example Answer: 
The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `st` is 0, so after execution, `st` becomes 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is 0, `st` is 1, `newnewk` is updated, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newizv` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` is such that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is 1, `newnewk` is updated, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newizv` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` is such that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**.
