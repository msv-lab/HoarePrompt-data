Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is one more than the previous value, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of the new value of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
