According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, and `newn` is the result of the previous `newn` subtracted by `newk` raised to the power of `st`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `st` needs to be incremented by 1, `newizv` needs to be updated accordingly, `izv` needs to be incremented by the new value of `newizv`, and `newn` needs to be updated according to the new values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st`.
State: **`st` needs to be incremented by 1, `newizv` needs to be updated, `izv` needs to be incremented by the new value of `newizv`, `newn` needs to be updated for the loop to execute again**
