Example Answer:
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact calculation cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` needs to be incremented by 1, `newizv` needs to be updated, `izv` is incremented by the new value of `newizv`, `newn` is updated for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`st` needs to be incremented by 1, `newizv` needs to be updated, `izv` is incremented by the new value of `newizv`, `newn` is updated for the loop to execute again**
