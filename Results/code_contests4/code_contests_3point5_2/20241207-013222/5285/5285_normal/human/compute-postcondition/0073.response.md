Example Answer:
`newizv` is assigned the value of `newizv` multiplied by 2 and then added 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` depends on its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `newizv` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2 and then added 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
