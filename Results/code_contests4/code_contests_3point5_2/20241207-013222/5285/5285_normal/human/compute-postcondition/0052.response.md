Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is 1, `b` is greater than 2, `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` is not empty, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is an integer within the specified range, `i` is 1, `st` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is 1, `b` is greater than 2, `izv` is 0, `res` is -1, `d_osn` is not empty, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `newn` is an integer within the specified range, `i` is 1, `st` is 0**
