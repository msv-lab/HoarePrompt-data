Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated to be the result of the previous value of `newizv` multiplied by 2 and then added 1. The other variables remain unchanged and the loop or if statement is exited. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `newizv` is updated, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i`, `newnewk` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is exited.
Output State: **`newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `newizv` is updated, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i`, `newnewk` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is exited.**
