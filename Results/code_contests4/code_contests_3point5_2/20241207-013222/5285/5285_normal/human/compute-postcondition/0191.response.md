According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `newnewk` remains unchanged, and `newizv` is updated. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `st` which means `i` should be less than the initial `st` value.
State: **`newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i` is increased by 1, `newnewk` remain unchanged for the loop to execute again, `newizv` is updated, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `st`**
