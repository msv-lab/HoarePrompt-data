Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The value of `newizv` is updated with the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1` for each iteration. The initial values are provided as `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is 0, `i` is `st`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `st` is greater than 0, `newk` is 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated with the formula `newizv = newizv * 2 + 1` for each iteration, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values.
