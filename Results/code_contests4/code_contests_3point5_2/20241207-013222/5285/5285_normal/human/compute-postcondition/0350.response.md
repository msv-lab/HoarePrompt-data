Example Answer:
The value of `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn`, `newk`, and `st` are greater than 0, less than or equal to 0, and the number of times the loop executed, respectively. Therefore, the new value of `newn` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **After the execution of the loop, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is updated to the final value calculated by multiplying the previous value of `newizv` by 2 and adding 1 `st` number of times, `izv` is updated by adding the new value of `newizv`, `newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0 after the loop finishes**
