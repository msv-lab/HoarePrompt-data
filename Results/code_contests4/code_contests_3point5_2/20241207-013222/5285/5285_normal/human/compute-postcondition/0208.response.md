Output State: **`newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk`, `st` is 0, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, `newn` becomes less than `newk`, `i` is less than 10, `i` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0**
