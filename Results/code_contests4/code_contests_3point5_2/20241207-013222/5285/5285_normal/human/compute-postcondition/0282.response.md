Postcondition: ***`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` is the sum of 2^st - 1 for each iteration of the loop, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than 2^st - 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newnewk` is 0, the loop has finished executing, `i` is equal to 10. If `res` is equal to -1, then no changes occur. If `res` is not equal to -1, then `res` is equal to `mlt`, and `mlt` is less than `res`.***
