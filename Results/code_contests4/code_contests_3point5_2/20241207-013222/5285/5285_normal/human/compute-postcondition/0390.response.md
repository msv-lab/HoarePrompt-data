Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. The previous values of `izv` and `newizv` are unknown, so the output state is: `st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is greater than `newk` after the loop executes, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `newn` still needs to be greater than `newk.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is greater than `newk` after the loop executes, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `newn` still needs to be greater than `newk**
