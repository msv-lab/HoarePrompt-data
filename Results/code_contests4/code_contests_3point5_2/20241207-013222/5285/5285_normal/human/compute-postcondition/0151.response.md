According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `st`, `newizv` is updated, and `izv` is incremented by `newizv`. For the loop to execute again, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, and `newn` needs to be updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`.

State: **`newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**.
