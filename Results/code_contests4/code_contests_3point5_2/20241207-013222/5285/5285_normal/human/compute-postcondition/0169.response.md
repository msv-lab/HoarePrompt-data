Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`newn`, `st`, `i`, `newizv`, `izv`, `mlt` remain unchanged, `res` is either the integer division result of `izv` divided by `d_osn[k]` or updated to `mlt` based on the conditions, `k` should be less than the length of `d_osn`, `newk` is assigned the value of `k`, `izv` is assigned the value 0, `newn` is assigned the value of `n`, `i` is 0**
