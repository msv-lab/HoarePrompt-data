Postcondition: ***`newn`, `st` is increased until `newnewk` becomes greater than `newn`, `newizv` is 0, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i` remain unchanged, `newnewk` is the result of multiplying `newk` by itself multiple times until it exceeds `newn`, `st` represents the number of iterations the loop executed. `st` is equal to 0***
