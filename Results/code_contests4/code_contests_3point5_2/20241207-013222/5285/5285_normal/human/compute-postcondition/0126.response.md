Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, updating the value of `newnewk`. The previous values of the variables are not directly impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is 0, `st` is 0, `newnewk` is updated, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newizv` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` is such that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is 0, `newnewk` is updated, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, `newizv` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `newk` is such that `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
