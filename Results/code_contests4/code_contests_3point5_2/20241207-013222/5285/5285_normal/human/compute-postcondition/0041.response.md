Example Answer:
`d_osn[b]` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not mention the values of `n`, `b`, or `cur`, so the output state is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is 1. Additionally, `b` is greater than 2.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is updated based on divisibility of `b` by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, for the loop to execute again `b` is 1. Additionally, `b` is greater than 2**
