Output State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is `st - 1`, `newizv` is updated to the final value after all iterations, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to the total number of iterations**
