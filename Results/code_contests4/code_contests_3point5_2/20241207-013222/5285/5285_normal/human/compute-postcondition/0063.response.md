Example Answer:
The value of `st` is increased by 1. The previous value of `st` is unknown, so the output state is: `newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is increased by 3, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, `st` is increased by 3, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
