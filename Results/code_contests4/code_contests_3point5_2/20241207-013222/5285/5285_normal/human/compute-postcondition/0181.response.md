Example Answer:
`newnewk` is multiplied by `newk`, where the previous value of `newnewk` is less than `newn` and `newk` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `newn`, `st` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`, `newnewk` is less than `newn`, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`.
Output State: **`newn`, `st` is increased by 1, `newizv` is 0, `newnewk` is assigned the value of `newk` multiplied by `newnewk`, `newnewk` is less than `newn`, `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`**
