According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to 0. So, to execute the loop again, `newn` needs to be adjusted to be equal to or greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is 1, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0, for the loop to execute again `newn` is equal to or greater than 0**
