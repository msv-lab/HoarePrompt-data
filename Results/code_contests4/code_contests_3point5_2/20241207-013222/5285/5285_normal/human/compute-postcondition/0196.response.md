Example Answer: 
`newn` is updated by subtracting the result of `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The loop executes `st` times to update `newk` each time. `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to run. `izv` is then incremented by the value of `newizv`. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`.
Output State: **`newn` is updated, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`**
