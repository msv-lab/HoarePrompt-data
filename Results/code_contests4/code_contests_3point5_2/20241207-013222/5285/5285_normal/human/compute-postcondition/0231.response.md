Example Answer: 
`newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`. The previous values of `newn` and `newk` are not given, so the exact calculation cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1), for the loop to execute the first time then newn is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of st, newn is updated by subtracting newk raised to the power of st.
