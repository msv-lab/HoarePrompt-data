Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value stored in `newizv`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
Output State: **`newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
