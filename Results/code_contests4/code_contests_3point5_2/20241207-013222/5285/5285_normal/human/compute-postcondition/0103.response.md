According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `st` is equal to 0 which means the loop won't execute. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `st` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than `newn`, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` had to be multiplied by `newk` to exceed `newn`, `i` is 0, `newizv` is now 0, `izv` remains the same, `newn` is 0, and `st` is equal to 0. To execute the loop, `st` needs to be greater than 0**
