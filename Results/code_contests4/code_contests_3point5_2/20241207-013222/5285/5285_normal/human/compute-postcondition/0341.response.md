State: **After the execution of the if statement, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 1, `newn` is 0, `newk` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0 after the loop finishes, and `st` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute the first time `st` must be greater than 0**
