According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `st` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `izv` is the sum of its previous value and `newizv`, `newn` is equal to the result of `newn - newk`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `st` should be increased by 1, and `newn` should be updated to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `izv` is the sum of its previous value and `newizv`, `newn` is equal to the result of `newn - newk`, for the loop to execute again `st` should be increased by 1 and `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
