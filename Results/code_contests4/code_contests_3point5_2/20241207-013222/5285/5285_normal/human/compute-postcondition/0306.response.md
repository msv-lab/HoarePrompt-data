According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `st`. If `st` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the initial state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute because `st` is equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` is equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `st` is 0**
