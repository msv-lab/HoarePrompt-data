According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `st`. So, for the loop to execute again, `st` should be less than 10. Additionally, since `st` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, it should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed and less than 10, `newizv` is (2^st) - 1, `izv` is the sum of all previous values of `newizv`, `newn` is 0, `newk` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
