Example Answer: 
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. All other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`, `newn` is updated to be the result of subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value**
