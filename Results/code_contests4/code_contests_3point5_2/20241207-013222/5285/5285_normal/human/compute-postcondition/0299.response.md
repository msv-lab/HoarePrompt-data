According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newnewk` and `newn`. If `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newnewk` is equal to the product of `newk` and `newnewk`, so for the loop to execute again, `newnewk` should be less than or equal to `newn`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`st` is 2, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `newnewk` is less than `newn`, the loop has finished executing, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is equal to the product of `newk` and `newnewk`, for the loop to execute again `newnewk` is less than or equal to `newn`, `newnewk` is equal to the product of `newnewk` and `newk`**
