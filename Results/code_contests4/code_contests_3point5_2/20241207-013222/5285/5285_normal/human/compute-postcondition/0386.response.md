According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated to be the result of subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `newn` needs to be updated to the result of subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk`, `newn` is updated to be the result of subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st` from its current value**
