Example Answer:
`d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` is divisible by `cur` without remainder. The initial state does not provide specific values for `n`, `b`, or `d_osn[cur]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2. If `b` is divisible by `cur` without remainder, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn` is a defaultdict with integer values, `cur` is 2. If `b` is divisible by `cur` without remainder, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
