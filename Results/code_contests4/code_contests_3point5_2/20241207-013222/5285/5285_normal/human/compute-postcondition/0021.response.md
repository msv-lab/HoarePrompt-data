Example Answer:
`b` is divided by `cur`, and the value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`. After execution, the value of `cur` is updated to a value greater than 3. The `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`n` and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is 0, `d_osn[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `b` was divisible by `cur`, `cur` is either 3 or a value greater than 3 after the execution of the if else block, the current value of `cur` is greater than or equal to the square root of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, for the loop to execute again `b` is greater than 1**
