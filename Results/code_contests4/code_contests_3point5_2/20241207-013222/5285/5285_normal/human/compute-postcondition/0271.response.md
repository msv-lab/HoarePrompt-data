Example Answer: 
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, which is 2^st - 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` has been updated by adding 2^st - 1.
Output State: **`st` is greater than or equal to 0, `newizv` is 2^st - 1, `izv` has been updated by adding 2^st - 1, `newn` has been updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, `newk` is less than 2^st - 1, `i` is equal to `st`, `newnewk` is 0, for the loop to execute again `newn` should be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
