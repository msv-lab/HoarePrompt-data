Example Answer:
`newizv` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1. The previous value of `newizv` is unknown, so the new value of `newizv` is dependent on the original value. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i` is increased by 1, `newnewk` remain unchanged for the loop to execute again, `newizv` is updated, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `st`.
Output State: **`newn`, `st` is greater than 0, `st` is equal to 0, `izv`, `mlt`, `res`, `k`, `newk`, `i` is increased by 1, `newnewk` remain unchanged for the loop to execute again, `newizv` is updated, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `st`**
