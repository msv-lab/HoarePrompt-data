Output State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is the number of times `newnewk` can be multiplied by `newk` to be less than or equal to 0, `newnewk` is 0, `i` is 1, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values, and `st` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
