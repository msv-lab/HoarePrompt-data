According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` to the power of `st`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `st` is greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute the first time, `newn` should be greater than `newk` to the power of `st` which means `newn` > `newk` ** `st`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv`, `newn`, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, for the loop to execute the first time `newn` is greater than `newk` ** `st`**
