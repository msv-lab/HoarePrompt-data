Example Answer:
`izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`. Since `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` will be incremented by (2^st - 1). The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1), `newn` is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than the new value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`.
Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newizv` is calculated as (2^st - 1), `izv` is incremented by (2^st - 1), `newn` is greater than (2^st - 1) raised to the power of `st`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than the new value of `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
