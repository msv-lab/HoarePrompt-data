According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Since it is a `while True` loop, it will continue indefinitely unless `i` becomes greater than or equal to 10. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`, which needs to be less than 10.
State: **`newn` is updated, `st` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `newk` is updated after looping `st` times, `izv` is incremented by the value of `newizv`, `newn` becomes less than `newk, i` is less than 10**
