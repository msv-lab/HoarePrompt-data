Output State: **`st` is the number of times the loop executed, `newizv` is 0, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `i` is equal to 10, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`, and `st` is equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
