According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `newn`, `newk`, and `st`. If `newn` is greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, and `izv` is incremented. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `newn` needs to be greater than `newk` raised to the power of `st` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`newn` is updated, `newk` is 0, `st` is greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented, for the loop to execute again `newn` is greater than `newk` ** st plus 1.**
