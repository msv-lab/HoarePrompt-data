Output State: **`st` is greater than 0, `newnewk`, `newk`, `newizv` are updated by doubling its value and adding 1 for each iteration of the loop, `izv` is incremented by `newizv`, `newn` is greater than `newk` after the loop executes, `i` is incremented by `st-1`, `res`, `mlt` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `newn` still needs to be greater than `newk`, `newn` is updated by subtracting `newk` raised to the power of `st`**
