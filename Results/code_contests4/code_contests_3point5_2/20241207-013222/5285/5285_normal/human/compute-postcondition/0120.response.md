According to the code, the loop will always execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `st - 1`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` to `st` to satisfy the condition `i < 10`.
State: **`newn` is 0, `st` is equal to the total number of iterations, `newnewk` is the smallest power of `newk` greater than 0, `i` is `st`, `newizv` is updated, `izv` is incremented by the sum of all updated `newizv` values**
