According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `st`. If `i` is less than `st`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10, `st` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should now be 11 and `st` should be greater than 11.
State: **`st` is 11, `newizv` is 1, `izv` is 0, `newn` is equal to `n`, `newk` is equal to `k`, `i` is 11, `res` is equal to `mlt`, `mlt` is less than `res`, `newnewk` is greater than `newn`**
