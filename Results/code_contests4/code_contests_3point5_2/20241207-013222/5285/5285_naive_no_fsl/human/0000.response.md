Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the number of trailing zero digits in the b-ary representation of n!. It first factors the base b, then iterates through the factors to calculate the number of trailing zeros. The program follows the problem description and works correctly for all the given examples. No edge cases or scenarios were identified where the program would not work as expected.
