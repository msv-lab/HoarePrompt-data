Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a bug in the `func_1` function where the `top` variable is being reassigned inside the function. However, this reassignment does not reflect back to the original `top` variable outside the function scope. This means that the binary search tree `T` is not being updated correctly when inserting nodes.

To fix this bug, the `func_1` function should return the updated `top` variable and the main loop should update `top` accordingly.
