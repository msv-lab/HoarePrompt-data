Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly implements the operations of inserting a node, finding a node, and printing the keys of the binary search tree using inorder and preorder tree walks.
2. The insert operation inserts a node containing the given key into the binary search tree.
3. The find operation correctly reports whether a node containing the given key exists in the tree.
4. The print operation correctly prints the keys of the binary search tree in inorder and preorder traversal.
5. The program handles the input constraints specified in the problem description.
6. The code structure is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear functions for each operation.
