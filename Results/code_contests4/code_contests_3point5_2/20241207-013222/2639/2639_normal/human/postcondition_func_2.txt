The function func_3 recursively traverses a binary tree starting from the given node, printing the key of each node in an inorder traversal. The function does not explicitly return any value. It checks if the current node has a left child, recursively processes it, prints the current node's key, then checks if the current node has a right child and recursively processes it if it exists. There are no specific return conditions specified in the annotations.
