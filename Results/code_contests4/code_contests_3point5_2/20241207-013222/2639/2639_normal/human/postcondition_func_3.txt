The function `func_4` recursively traverses a tree starting from the given `node`. It prints the key of each node in a depth-first manner. The function does not have a return value. Each node in the tree can have left and right children, and if they exist, the function recursively calls itself on them. The annotations provide information about the state of the program before and after each recursive call, and specify the constraints on the keys that can be inserted or found in the tree.
