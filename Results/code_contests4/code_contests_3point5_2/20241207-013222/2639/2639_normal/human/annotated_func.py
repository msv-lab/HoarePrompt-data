    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node (most likely None). The loop has finished executing.

        top = z

        if (z.key < y.key) :
            y.left = z
        else :
            y.right = z
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `y` is not None. If `z.key` is less than `y.key`, then `y.left` is assigned the value of `z`. If `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key`, then `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. If `y` is None, `y` becomes None and `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None, then based on the comparison of keys between `z` and `y`, either `y.left` or `y.right` is updated with the value of `z` accordingly.
    return top
    #The program returns the value of 'top' after the specified operations on 'm', 'y', 'x', and 'z' have been performed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts parameters `top` and `z`. `top` is a non-negative integer. The program iterates through a loop until `x` is not an instance of Node, updating `y` along the way. After the loop, it assigns `z.parent` to `y`, then based on conditions, updates the tree structure represented by `top` with `z`. Finally, it returns the updated `top`. The functionality of the function is to manipulate a tree data structure represented by `top` by inserting node `z` in the correct place and returning the updated `top`.

        #The program returns the result of calling func_2 with node.left and key as arguments
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *node is true. node.key is not equal to key. key is either greater than or equal to node.key
    return func_2(node.right, key)
    #The program returns the result of calling func_2 with arguments node.right and key
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`. It checks if `node` is falsy and returns False. If `node.key` is equal to `key`, it returns True. If `key` is less than `node.key`, it recursively calls `func_2` with `node.left` and `key` as arguments. Otherwise, it recursively calls `func_2` with `node.right` and `key`. The function essentially performs a search operation based on the key values in the nodes of a binary tree.

    if node.left :
        func_3(node.left)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is a variable containing an object with a left attribute. If `node.left` evaluates to True, it means the left attribute of the object exists. Otherwise, if `node.left` is False or None, it implies that the left attribute does not exist.
    print('', node.key, end='')
    if node.right :
        func_3(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`node` is a variable containing an object with a left attribute. If `node.left` evaluates to True, it means the left attribute of the object exists. Otherwise, if `node.left` is False or None, it implies that the left attribute does not exist. Also, if `node.right` evaluates to True, it means the right attribute of the object exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 recursively traverses a binary tree starting from the given node, printing the key of each node in an inorder traversal. The function does not explicitly return any value. It checks if the current node has a left child, recursively processes it, prints the current node's key, then checks if the current node has a right child and recursively processes it if it exists. There are no specific return conditions specified in the annotations.

        func_4(node.left)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. If the left child of the node exists, then the function call func_4 is applied to the left child. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.
    if node.right :
        func_4(node.right)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *m is a positive integer. If the left child of the node exists, then the function call func_4 is applied to the left child. The right child of the node exists. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` recursively traverses a tree starting from the given `node`. It prints the key of each node in a depth-first manner. The function does not have a return value. Each node in the tree can have left and right children, and if they exist, the function recursively calls itself on them. The annotations provide information about the state of the program before and after each recursive call, and specify the constraints on the keys that can be inserted or found in the tree.
