Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program does not have the required functionality to handle the "print" operation as described in the problem description. The "print" operation should print the keys of the binary search tree by inorder tree walk and preorder tree walk respectively. However, the program does not have any functionality to perform these operations.

2. The program does not have any handling for the "find" operation. The "find" operation should report whether the binary search tree has a node containing a specific key, but the program does not have any implementation for this operation. 

3. The program lacks the necessary logic to handle the constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as limiting the number of operations and ensuring the keys in the binary search tree are all different. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and is incorrect.
