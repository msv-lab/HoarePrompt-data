The code provided seems to be correct based on the problem description and the functions provided. Here is an initial assessment:

1. The `func_1` function correctly inserts a node into the binary search tree based on the key value.
2. The `func_2` function correctly searches for a node with a specific key in the binary search tree.
3. The `func_3` function correctly performs an inorder traversal of the binary search tree and prints the keys.
4. The `func_4` function correctly performs a preorder traversal of the binary search tree and prints the keys.

The output hints also seem to align with the functions and the problem description provided. 

Therefore, based on the initial assessment, the code appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**.
