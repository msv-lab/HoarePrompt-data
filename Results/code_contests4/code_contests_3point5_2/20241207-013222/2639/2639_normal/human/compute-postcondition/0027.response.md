Example Answer:
The right child of node `y` is assigned the value of node `z`. Since `y` is an instance of Node and `z` is not an instance of Node, the right child of `y` is now pointing to `z`. The relationship between `y` and `z` has been updated to reflect this new assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `y` is not None, `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`, `y` is not None, `z.key` is greater than or equal to `y.key, `y.right` is assigned the value of `z`**
