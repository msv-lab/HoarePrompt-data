Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `node` and `key`. It checks if `node` is falsy and returns False. If `node.key` is equal to `key`, it returns True. If `key` is less than `node.key`, it recursively calls `func_2` with `node.left` and `key` as arguments. Otherwise, it recursively calls `func_2` with `node.right` and `key`. The function essentially performs a search operation based on the key values in the nodes of a binary tree.**
