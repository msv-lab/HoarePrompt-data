Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `x.right`, where `x.right` is the right child of the Node instance stored in `x`. The value of `x` changes based on the right child it points to. The states of `m` and `y` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is an updated instance of Node.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is an updated instance of Node**
