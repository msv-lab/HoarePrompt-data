The function `func_1` accepts parameters `top` and `z`. `top` is a non-negative integer. The program returns the value of `top` after the specified operations on `m`, `y`, `x`, and `z` have been performed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `top` and another parameter `z`, and then return the value of `top` after performing certain operations on other variables.
