Example Answer:
`z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. The variables `m` and `x` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`**
