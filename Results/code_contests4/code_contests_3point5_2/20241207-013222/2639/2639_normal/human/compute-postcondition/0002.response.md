Example Answer:
`func_4(node.left)` is called, which executes the function `func_4` on the left child of the node. The initial state mentions that the node has a left child, so the left child undergoes the function call. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **The left child of the node undergoes the function call `func_4`**
