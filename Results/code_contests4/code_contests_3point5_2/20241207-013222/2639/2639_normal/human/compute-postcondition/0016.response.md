Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `x.left`. Since `x` is an instance of Node, accessing `x.left` likely means moving to the left child node of `x`. The value of `m` and `y` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is now pointing to its left child node.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is now pointing to its left child node**
