Postcondition: ***`m` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an instance of Node, `x` is not an instance of Node, `z.parent` is assigned the value of `y`. If `y` is None, `y` becomes None and `top` is assigned the value of `z`. If `y` is not None, then based on the comparison of keys between `z` and `y`, either `y.left` or `y.right` is updated with the value of `z` accordingly.***
