Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move by flipping a segment of the array. It iterates through all possible segments to flip and calculates the count of 1s in the modified array. The program then keeps track of the maximum count encountered and prints it at the end. 

Since the program considers all possible segments to flip and updates the maximum count accordingly, it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
