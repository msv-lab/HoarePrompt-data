    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `end` is equal to `n-1`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`, `i` is equal to `end+1`
    print(maximum_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, each either 0 or 1. It then iterates over all possible subarrays of `a`, toggles the elements in those subarrays, calculates the sum of toggled elements, and keeps track of the maximum sum obtained. The function prints out the maximum sum of toggled elements. However, the function does not explicitly return any value. It might be missing the functionality to handle cases where `n` is not within the specified range of 1 to 100, and it does not consider the case where the input list `a` is empty.
