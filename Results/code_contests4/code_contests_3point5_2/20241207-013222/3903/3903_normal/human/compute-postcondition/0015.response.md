Example Answer:
The maximum_count is updated to the maximum value between the current maximum_count and the count. The value of maximum_count is modified based on the comparison of the current maximum_count and count. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `end` is greater than or equal to `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a list created from `a` where each element has been toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, maximum_count is updated to the maximum of maximum_count and count.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is greater than or equal to `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a list created from `a` where each element has been toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, maximum_count is updated to the maximum of maximum_count and count**
