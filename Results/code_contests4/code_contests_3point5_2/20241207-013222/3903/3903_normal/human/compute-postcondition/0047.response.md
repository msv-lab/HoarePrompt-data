Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `end` is incremented by 1, `start` is equal to the lower bound of the range defined by `start` and `end + 1`, `b` is a new list containing the same elements as list `a` but with each element toggled (0s become 1s and 1s become 0s)**
