Example Answer:
The variable `count` is assigned the sum of elements in list `b`. Since `b` contains elements that are toggled versions of the elements in list `a`, the sum of elements in `b` is the count of toggled 1s in list `a`. The `maximum_count` is then updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and the count of toggled 1s in list `a`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to a new value, `end` is incremented by 2, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a new list containing the toggled elements of list `a`, `count` is the count of toggled 1s in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to a new value, `end` is incremented by 2, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a new list containing the toggled elements of list `a`, `count` is the count of toggled 1s in list `a`**
