Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `maximum_count` without modifying any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a`, `end` is equal to `n-1`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`, `i` is equal to `end+1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a`, `end` is equal to `n-1`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`, `i` is equal to `end+1`**
