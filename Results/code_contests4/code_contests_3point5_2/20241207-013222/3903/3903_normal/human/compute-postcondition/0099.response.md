According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `end`, `end` is less than `n+1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n+2`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a` after the execution of the if else block, `i` is equal to `start`, `end` is less than or equal to `n+1`**
