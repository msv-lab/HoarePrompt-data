Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned a copy of list `a`, so `b` now contains all the elements of `a`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n+1`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a` after the execution of the if else block.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n+1`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a` after the execution of the if else block**
