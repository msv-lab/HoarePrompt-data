According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the loop, the `maximum_count` is updated based on the toggled 1s in `a`. To execute the loop one more time, `end` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all the iterations of the loop have finished, for the loop to execute one more time `end` is incremented by 1**
