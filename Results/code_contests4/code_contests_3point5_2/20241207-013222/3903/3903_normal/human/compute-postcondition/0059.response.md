Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a`, `end` is incremented by 2, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a new list containing the same elements as list `a` but with each element toggled, `count` is the sum of elements in list `b`, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of elements in list `b` after the execution of the if else block, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `start` where `b[i]` is toggled by subtracting the current value from 1.**
