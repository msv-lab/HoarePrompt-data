Example Answer:
The list `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, so `b` contains the opposite of each element in `a`. The sum of `b` gives the count of toggled 1s in `a`, which is stored in the variable `count`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`**
