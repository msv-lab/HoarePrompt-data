Example Answer: 
`b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1 by subtracting the current value from 1. The previous value of `b[i]` is either 0 or 1. After execution, `b[i]` will be the opposite value. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `end` is at least 3, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is not empty for the loop to execute a third time, `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is at least 3, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is not empty for the loop to execute a third time, `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1**
