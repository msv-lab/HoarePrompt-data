Example Answer:
The input values are mapped to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it. Since `n` is an input integer and each input value is either 0 or 1, after mapping, `a` will contain a list of integers with values of either 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s**
