According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `start` from 0 to n-1. The loop will always execute as long as n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0 does not affect the execution of the loop, so it remains the same. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
