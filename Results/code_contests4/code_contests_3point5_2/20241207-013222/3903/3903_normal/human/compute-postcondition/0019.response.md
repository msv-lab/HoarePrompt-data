According to the code, the loop will execute if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. At the start of the loop, the `i` value will iterate from `start` to `end` inclusive. The states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `a` is unchanged, `b` is a copy of `a` with each element toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum of `maximum_count` and `count`, for the loop to execute `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `i` is equal to `start`**
