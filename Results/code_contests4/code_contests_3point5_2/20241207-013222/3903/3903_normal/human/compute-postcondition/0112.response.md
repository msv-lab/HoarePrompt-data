Example Answer:
`b[i]` is toggled to 1 if its current value is 0, and to 0 if its current value is 1. The value of `b[i]` is updated accordingly. Since `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, the state of `b` is also updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is equal to `end + 1`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with `b[i]` toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`, `i` is equal to `end + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is equal to `end + 1`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with `b[i]` toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`, `i` is equal to `end + 1`**
