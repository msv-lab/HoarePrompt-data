According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is less than or equal to `n`. In the for loop, `end` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `end` should be less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n+1`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a` after the execution of the if else block, `i` is equal to `end+1`, `end` is less than or equal to `n`, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a`.**
