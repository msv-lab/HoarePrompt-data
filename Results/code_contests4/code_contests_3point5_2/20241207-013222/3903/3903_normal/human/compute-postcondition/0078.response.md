Example Answer:
The `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, all elements in list `b` will be toggled, `count` will be the total number of toggled elements in list `b`, `maximum_count` will be updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` will be greater than `start`, `start` will be incremented by 4, `n` will remain greater than 0, `a` will be unchanged.
