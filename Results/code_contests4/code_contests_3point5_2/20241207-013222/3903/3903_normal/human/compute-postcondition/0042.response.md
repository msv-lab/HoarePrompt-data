According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `start` and `n`. If `start` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `start` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all the iterations of the loop have finished, for the loop to execute one more time `start` should be incremented by 1**
