According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. The loop will execute if the range defined by `start` and `end + 1` is valid. 

Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
- `start` should be less than or equal to `end`
- `maximum_count` should be updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`
- `end` should be incremented by 4
- `b` should be a new list containing the toggled elements of list `a`
- `count` should be the sum of elements in list `b` after the execution of the if else block

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is incremented by 4, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a new list containing the toggled elements of list `a`, and `count` is the sum of elements in list `b` after the execution of the if else block**
