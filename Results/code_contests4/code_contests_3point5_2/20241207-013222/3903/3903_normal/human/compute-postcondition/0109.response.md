According to the code, the loop can execute if the range specified by `start` and `end + 1` is valid. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `start` must be less than or equal to `end + 1`. Additionally, the loop conditions suggest that `end + 1` should be less than or equal to `n`, so `end` should be less than `n`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end + 1`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a` after the execution of the if else block, `i` is equal to `end + 1`**
