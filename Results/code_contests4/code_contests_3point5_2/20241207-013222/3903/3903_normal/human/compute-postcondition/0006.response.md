Example Answer:
`b` is assigned a list that is a copy of the elements in `a`. The values of `n`, `end`, and `start` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and `b` is a list created from `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a list created from `a`**
