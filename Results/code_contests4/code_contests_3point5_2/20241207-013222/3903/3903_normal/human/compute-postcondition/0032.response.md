Example Answer:
The value of `b[i]` is toggled between 0 and 1. Since the previous values of `b` and `i` are unknown, we can't determine the exact state of `b` after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than `end + 1`, `a` is updated, `b` is created from `a` with elements toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than `end + 1`, `a` is updated, `b` is created from `a` with elements toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated**
