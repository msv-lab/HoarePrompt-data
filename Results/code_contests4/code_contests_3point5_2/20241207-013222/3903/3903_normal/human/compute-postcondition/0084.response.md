Example Answer:
`b` is assigned a copy of the list `a`. The values and structure of `a` are copied to `b`, so `b` becomes an independent copy of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all iterations of the loop have finished, for the loop to execute `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and `b` is a copy of list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a` after all iterations of the loop have finished, for the loop to execute `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and `b` is a copy of list `a`**
