According to the code, the loop can execute again if `end` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `end` is incremented by 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `end` should be incremented by 2 again and be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is incremented by 4, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a new list containing the toggled elements of list `a`, and `count` is the sum of elements in list `b` after the execution of the if else block**
