According to the code, the loop can execute if the range defined by `start` and `end + 1` is not empty. So, in order for the loop to execute, `start` should be less than `end + 1`. Additionally, since `end` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `end` needs to be less than `n`. The toggling of elements in list `b` from list `a` indicates that some elements in `a` have been changed, so `a` needs to be updated to reflect these changes. The sum of elements in `b`, denoted by `count`, should also be updated accordingly. Lastly, `maximum_count` should be updated to be the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than `end + 1`, `a` is updated, `b` is created from `a` with elements toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated**
