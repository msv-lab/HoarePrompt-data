Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is greater than `start`, `start` is incremented by 4, `b` is a new list containing the toggled elements of list `a`, and `count` is the sum of elements in list `b` after the execution of the if else block. After the loop finishes executing, all elements in list `b` will be toggled, `count` will be the total number of toggled elements in list `b`, `maximum_count` will be updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` will be greater than `start`, `start` will be incremented by 4, `n` will remain greater than 0, `a` will be unchanged.***
