According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start`, `end`, and `n`. If `start` is less than `end + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than `end + 1`, `a` is updated, `b` is created from `a` with elements toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, `start` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is incremented by 1, `a` is updated, `b` is created from `a` with elements toggled between 0 and 1, `count` is the sum of elements in `b`, `maximum_count` is updated**
