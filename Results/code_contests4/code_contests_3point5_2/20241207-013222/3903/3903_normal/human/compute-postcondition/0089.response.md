According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is within the range of `start` to `end`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a`, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a`, `i` is equal to `start + 1`, and `b[i]` is toggled to either 0 or 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a`, `end` is less than `n`, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a copy of list `a`, `i` is equal to `start + 2`, `b[i]` is toggled to either 0 or 1**
