Example Answer:
The `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and the `count`. The `count` represents the sum of elements in list `b`. Therefore, after running the code, the `maximum_count` will be updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and the sum of elements in list `b`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is the maximum count of toggled 1s in `a`, `end` is incremented by 1, `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `b` is a new list containing the same elements as list `a` but with each element toggled, `count` is the sum of elements in list `b`, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous maximum_count and the sum of elements in list b**.
