Example Answer:
`maximum_count` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is 0**
