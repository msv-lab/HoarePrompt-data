According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `maximum_count` is 0 does not influence the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than 0 and `end` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `end` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
