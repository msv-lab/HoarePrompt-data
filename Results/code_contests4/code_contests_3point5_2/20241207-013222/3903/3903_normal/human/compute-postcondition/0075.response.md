Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is incremented by 1, `start` is incremented by 1, `b` is a new list containing the toggled elements of list `a` for the next iteration, `count` is the sum of elements in the updated list `b` after the execution of the if else block, for the loop to execute one more time `start` needs to be further incremented by 1 and `end` needs to be incremented by 1, `b[i]` is toggled to 1 if it was 0 or to 0 if it was 1.**
