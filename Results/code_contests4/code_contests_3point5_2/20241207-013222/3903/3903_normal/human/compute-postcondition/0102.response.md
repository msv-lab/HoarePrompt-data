Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in list `b` is toggled to `1 - b[i]`. This means if the value at index `i` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The value of `count` is updated to reflect the sum of toggled 1s in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n+2`, `start` is less than or equal to `end+1`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a` after the execution of the if else block, `i` is equal to `start`, `end` is less than or equal to `n+2`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `maximum_count` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maximum_count` and `count`, `end` is less than `n+2`, `start` is less than or equal to `end+1`, `b` is a copy of list `a` with all elements toggled, `count` is the sum of toggled 1s in `a` after the execution of the if else block, `i` is equal to `start`, `end` is less than or equal to `n+2`**
