Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by iterating over all possible ranges [i, j] and flipping the values within that range. It then calculates the sum of 1s in the modified list and keeps track of the maximum count seen so far. Finally, it prints the maximum count of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move.

The program ensures that only one move is made by iterating over all possible ranges [i, j] and updating the count of 1s accordingly. It covers all possible scenarios and returns the correct output as per the problem description.
