Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, each either 0 or 1. It then iterates over all possible subarrays of `a`, toggles the elements in those subarrays, calculates the sum of toggled elements, and keeps track of the maximum sum obtained. The function prints out the maximum sum of toggled elements. However, the function does not explicitly return any value. It might be missing the functionality to handle cases where `n` is not within the specified range of 1 to 100, and it does not consider the case where the input list `a` is empty.
