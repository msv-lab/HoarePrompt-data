According to the code, the loop will execute 100 times regardless of the values of `f`, `s`, `p`, `n` at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop will always execute 100 times, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `p`, which is multiplied by 2 at the end of each iteration.
State: **`f`, `s`, `p` are integers with `n` greater than 0, `p` is doubled**
