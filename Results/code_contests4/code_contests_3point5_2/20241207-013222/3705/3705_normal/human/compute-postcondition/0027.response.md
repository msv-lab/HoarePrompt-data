Example Answer: 
The value of `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. Since `p` is doubled, the minimum value between `p` and `n` would be the original value of `p`. Therefore, `f` is increased by `p`. The value of `p` remains doubled. The value of `s` is not affected. 
Output State: **`f` is incremented by `p`, `s` remains the same, `p` is doubled**
