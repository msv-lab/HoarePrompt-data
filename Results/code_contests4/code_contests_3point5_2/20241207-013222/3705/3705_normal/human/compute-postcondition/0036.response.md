Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18. It calculates two values `f` and `s` based on the value of `n` in a loop. At the end, it returns the result of `f` squared plus `s` multiplied by `s` plus 1. In Case 1, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0. **
