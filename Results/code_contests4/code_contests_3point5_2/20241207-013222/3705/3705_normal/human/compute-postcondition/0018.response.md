Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the minimum value will always be `p` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise it will be `n`. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be increased by `min(p, n)`. The states of `f` and `p` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`f`, `s`, `p` are integers, `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`**
