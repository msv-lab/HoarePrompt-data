Postcondition: ***`f`, `s`, `p`, `n` are integers. If i is not divisible by 2, `s` is updated to the minimum value between `p` and `n`, `f` remains 0, `p` remains 1, and `n` remains not equal to 0. If i is divisible by 2, `f` is updated by adding the minimum value between `p` and `n`, `s` remains 0, `p` remains 1, and `n` remains not equal to 0.***
