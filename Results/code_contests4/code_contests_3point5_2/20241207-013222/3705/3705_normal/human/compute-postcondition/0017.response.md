According to the code, the loop will execute 100 times. At the end of the previous iteration, `f`, `s`, `p` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, then `n` is updated to `n - p` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `p` is multiplied by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`f`, `s`, `p` are integers, `n` must be greater than 0**.
