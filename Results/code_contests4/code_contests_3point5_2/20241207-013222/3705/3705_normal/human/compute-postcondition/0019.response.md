Example Answer:
`f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the minimum value between `p` and `n` will always be `p` if `p` is less than `n`. Therefore, `f` is incremented by `p`. The states of `s` and `p` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`, `s` is an integer, `p` is an integer**
