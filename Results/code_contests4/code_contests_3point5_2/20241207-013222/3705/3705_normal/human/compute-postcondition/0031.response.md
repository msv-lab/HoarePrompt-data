Postcondition: ***`f`, `s`, `p`, `n` are integers with `n` greater than 0. If i is odd, `p` is doubled, `s` is increased by the minimum value between the doubled `p` and `n`. If i is even, `f` is incremented by `p`, `s` remains the same, `p` is doubled. `n` is decreased by the value of `p` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
