The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. The constraints for `n` are that it is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18. The function has two cases for output:

Case 1: The program returns 0.
Case 2: The program returns the result of f squared plus s multiplied by s plus 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified constraints and return 0 in Case 1, or the result of a mathematical expression in Case 2.
