Example Answer:
The value of `s` is increased by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. Given that `p` is doubled, the new value of `p` is 2 times its previous value. Therefore, the new value of `s` is the sum of the previous value of `s` and the minimum value between the doubled `p` and `n`. 
Output State: **`f`, `s`, `p` are integers with `n` greater than 0, `p` is doubled, `s` is increased by the minimum value between the doubled `p` and `n`**
