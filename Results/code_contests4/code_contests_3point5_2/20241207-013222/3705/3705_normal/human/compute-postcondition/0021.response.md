Output State: **`f`, `s`, `p` are integers, `n` must be greater than 0. If `i % 2` is true, `s` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`. If `i % 2` is false, `f` is incremented by the minimum value between `p` and `n`, `s` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `n` is decremented by `p`.**
