You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Nazar, a student of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, is known for his outstanding mathematical abilities. Today a math teacher gave him a very difficult task.

Consider two infinite sets of numbers. The first set consists of odd positive numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, …), and the second set consists of even positive numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, …). At the first stage, the teacher writes the first number on the endless blackboard from the first set, in the second stage — the first two numbers from the second set, on the third stage — the next four numbers from the first set, on the fourth — the next eight numbers from the second set and so on. In other words, at each stage, starting from the second, he writes out two times more numbers than at the previous one, and also changes the set from which these numbers are written out to another. 

The ten first written numbers: 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10. Let's number the numbers written, starting with one.

The task is to find the sum of numbers with numbers from l to r for given integers l and r. The answer may be big, so you need to find the remainder of the division by 1000000007 (10^9+7).

Nazar thought about this problem for a long time, but didn't come up with a solution. Help him solve this problem.

Input

The first line contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^{18}) — the range in which you need to find the sum.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).

Note

In the first example, the answer is the sum of the first three numbers written out (1 + 2 + 4 = 7).

In the second example, the numbers with numbers from 5 to 14: 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. Their sum is 105.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18.**
def func_1(n):
    f = 0
    s = 0
    p = 1
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is `0`, `s` is `0`, `p` is `1`, and `n` is not equal to 0
    for i in range(100):
        if i % 2:
            s += min(p, n)
        else:
            f += min(p, n)
        
        n -= p
        
        if n <= 0:
            break
        
        p *= 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f`, `s`, `p` are integers with updated values, `n` will eventually reach 0 or less, and the loop will break.
    return f * f + s * (s + 1)
    #The program returns the result of f squared plus s multiplied by s plus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18. It calculates two values `f` and `s` based on the value of `n` in a loop. At the end, it returns the result of `f` squared plus `s` multiplied by `s` plus 1. In Case 1, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
