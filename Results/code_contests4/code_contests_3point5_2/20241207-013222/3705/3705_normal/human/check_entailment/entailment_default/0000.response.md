Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is not correctly calculating the sum of numbers from l to r as described in the problem. The function is calculating two values `f` and `s` based on the value of `n` in a loop, but the calculation logic is incorrect. The formula used to calculate the result at the end of the function is incorrect and does not match the problem description.

For example, if we take the input l=1, r=3, the code should output 7 as the sum of the first three numbers written out (1 + 2 + 4 = 7). However, the code will not produce the correct result for this input.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases as per the problem description.
