Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is supposed to find the sum of numbers with numbers from l to r, but the function `func_1` in the program does not perform this task. Instead, it calculates two values `f` and `s` based on the input `n` and returns `f` squared plus `s` multiplied by `s` plus 1. This output does not represent the sum of numbers from l to r as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
