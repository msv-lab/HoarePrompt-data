Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program calculates and returns the sum of the first `n` numbers, where `n` is the input parameter passed to the function `func_1`. However, the problem description requires finding the sum of numbers with numbers from `l` to `r` for given integers `l` and `r`, not just the sum of the first `n` numbers.

Therefore, the program does not solve the problem as described in the problem description.
