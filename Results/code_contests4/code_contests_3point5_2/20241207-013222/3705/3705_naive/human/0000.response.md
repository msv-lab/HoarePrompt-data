Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program is calculating the sum of numbers in the given range based on the problem description. It iterates through the range and calculates the sum of odd and even numbers separately. The formula used to calculate the sum is correct according to the problem statement. The code handles the cases where l is 0 or n is less than or equal to 0. The modulo operation at the end ensures that the result is within the specified range. Since the code follows the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples, it can be considered correct.
