Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The logic in the `func_1` function does not follow the pattern of summing the numbers from the alternating sets as described in the problem. Additionally, the formula used to calculate the result is not correct based on the problem description.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
5 14

Expected Output:
