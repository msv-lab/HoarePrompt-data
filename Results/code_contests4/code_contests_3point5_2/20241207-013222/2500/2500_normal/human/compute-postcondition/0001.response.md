The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `i` and `j`, both of which are integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between two points `(X[i], Y[i])` and `(X[j], Y[j])`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `i` and `j`, and calculate the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points based on the indices provided.
