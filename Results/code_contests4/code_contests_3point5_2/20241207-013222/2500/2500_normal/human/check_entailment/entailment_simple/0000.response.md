Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(i, j)` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j]). This function is needed to calculate the time required for a piece of meat to be ready based on the provided formula in the problem description. The program correctly implements the required functionality of calculating the Euclidean distance between two points, which is essential for solving the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
