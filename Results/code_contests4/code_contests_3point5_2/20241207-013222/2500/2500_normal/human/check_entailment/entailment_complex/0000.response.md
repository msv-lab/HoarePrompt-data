Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points given their coordinates. This function is used in the main program to calculate the time required for each piece of meat to be ready to eat based on the position of the heat source.

The main program is not provided in the annotations, but based on the function `func_1` and the problem description, we can infer that the program likely calculates the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready, while minimizing this time by optimizing the position of the heat source.

Since the function `func_1` correctly calculates the Euclidean distance, and the main program likely utilizes this function to find the optimal position of the heat source, the program is correct as it follows the problem description.
