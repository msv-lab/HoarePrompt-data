#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(i, j):
    return math.sqrt((X[i] - X[j]) ** 2 + (Y[i] - Y[j]) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between two points (X[i], Y[i]) and (X[j], Y[j])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `i` and `j` as parameters. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the points `(X[i], Y[i])` and `(X[j], Y[j])`.
