Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for N, K, x, y, and c.
2. It then calculates the optimal time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready by minimizing the time using binary search.
3. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description.
4. The logic for calculating the distance between two points, checking if the pieces of meat are ready, and updating the time accordingly seems to be correct.
5. The program terminates when the difference between the upper and lower bounds is less than 1e-09, which ensures a precise result.
6. Overall, the program structure and logic align with the problem description, and it seems to work correctly for all potential cases.
