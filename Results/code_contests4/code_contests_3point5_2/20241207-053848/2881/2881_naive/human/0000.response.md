Correctness: **False**

The given program has some issues:
1. The function `gcd` is not defined in the code, so it will result in a NameError.
2. The function `rints` is not defined in the code, so it will result in a NameError.
3. There is a typo in the code (`rints` instead of `ints`).
4. The code does not handle the case where it's not possible to reduce the monitor size to the desired ratio `x:y`. It should output `0 0` in such cases, but it doesn't.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
