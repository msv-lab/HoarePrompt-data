Example Answer:
en is assigned the value mid - 1. The value of mid is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of en. Therefore, the Output State is: a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9, be is less than en, x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9, be is less than en, x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b for the loop to execute again**
