Postcondition: ***a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9, be is less than en, x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b for the loop to execute again. If x * mid <= a and y * mid <= b, the loop continues. Otherwise, en is assigned the value of mid - 1.***
