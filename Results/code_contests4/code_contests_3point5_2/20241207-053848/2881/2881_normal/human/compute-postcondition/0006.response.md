Postcondition: ***a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. For the loop to execute the first time, be is less than en, mid is calculated based on the current values of be and en. Additionally, if x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b, then the program proceeds accordingly. If x times mid is greater than a or y times mid is greater than b, then the else part is executed.***
