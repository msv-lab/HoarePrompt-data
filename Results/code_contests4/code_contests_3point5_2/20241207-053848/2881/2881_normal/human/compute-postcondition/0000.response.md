According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. Since the loop condition is `be < en`, it implies that `be` should be less than `en` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `be` is less than `en`.
State: **a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. For the loop to execute the first time, be is less than en**
