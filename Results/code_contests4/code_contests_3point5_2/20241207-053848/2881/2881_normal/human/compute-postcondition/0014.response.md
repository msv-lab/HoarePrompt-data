Example Answer:
`be` is assigned the value of `mid`, where the value of `mid` is unknown based on the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9, be is less than en, x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9, be is less than en, x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b for the loop to execute again**
