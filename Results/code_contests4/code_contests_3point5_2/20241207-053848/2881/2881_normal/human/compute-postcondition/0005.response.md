Example Answer:
`en` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The previous values of `mid` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `en`. However, we know that `mid` is calculated based on the current values of `be` and `en`, and either `x * mid > a` or `y * mid > b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9. For the loop to execute the first time, be is less than en, mid is calculated based on the current values of be and en. Additionally, either x * mid > a or y * mid > b`.
