Example Answer:
`en` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated based on the provided formula. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9, be is less than en, x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b for the loop to execute again, mid is calculated based on the formula provided; en is assigned the value of mid - 1.
Output State: **`a, b, x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, x, y ≤ 2·10^9, be is less than en, x times mid is less than or equal to a, and y times mid is less than or equal to b for the loop to execute again, mid is calculated based on the formula provided; en is assigned the value of mid - 1.**
