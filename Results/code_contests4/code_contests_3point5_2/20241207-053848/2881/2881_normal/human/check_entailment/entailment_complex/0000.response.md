Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible reduction in size of the monitor while maintaining the desired screen sides ratio. The conditions x * mid <= a and y * mid <= b are checked in each iteration of the while loop to determine if the reduction is possible. The final output is the reduced screen parameters if a valid reduction exists, otherwise it outputs 0 0 as expected. The program covers all possible cases as specified in the problem description and provides the correct output.
