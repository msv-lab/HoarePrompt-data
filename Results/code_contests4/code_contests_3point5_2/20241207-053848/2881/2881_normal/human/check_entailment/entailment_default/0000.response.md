Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not completely follow the problem description. The code calculates the reduced size model of the monitor based on the screen sides ratio x:y and maximum area. However, there are some issues in the implementation:
1. The code has redundant lines of code that are repeated unnecessarily.
2. The function `func_1` is defined but not used anywhere in the code.
3. The code does not handle the case when the answer does not exist and should output "0 0" accordingly.
4. There are issues with the logic in the while loop in the function `func_1`.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
