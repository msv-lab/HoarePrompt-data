Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible screen size reduction while maintaining the aspect ratio x:y. It iterates through possible values of the reduced size using the binary search algorithm until it finds the largest possible reduction that still fits within the original screen size. The final output is the reduced screen size that maximizes the total area while keeping the aspect ratio intact. The program satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
