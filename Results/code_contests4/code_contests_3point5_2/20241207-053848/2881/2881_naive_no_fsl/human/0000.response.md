Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input values for a, b, x, and y.
2. It then calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y to simplify the ratio.
3. It finds the minimum number of times x and y can fit into a and b respectively.
4. The program then prints the reduced screen parameters based on the calculated values.
5. The program uses binary search to find the maximum area reduction possible while maintaining the ratio x:y.
6. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
7. The program should work as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
