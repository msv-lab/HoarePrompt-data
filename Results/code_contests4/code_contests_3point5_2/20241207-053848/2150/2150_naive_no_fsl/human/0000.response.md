Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the input and constructs the tree as an adjacency list.
2. It then finds the leaf nodes in the tree.
3. It recursively calculates the size of each subtree starting from each leaf node.
4. It then iterates through all the edges and counts the number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size.
5. The final count is printed as the output.

The program follows the problem description and logic correctly. It handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.
