Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly determines the maximum number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size. The program first checks if the total number of vertices in the tree is odd, in which case it immediately outputs -1. Then, it defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to traverse the tree and calculate the sizes of each subtree. Finally, it iterates through all edges and counts the number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size. The program handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.
