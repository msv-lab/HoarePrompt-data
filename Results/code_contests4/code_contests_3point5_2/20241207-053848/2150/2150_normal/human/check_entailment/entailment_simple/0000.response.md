Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all remaining connected components will have even size. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description.
