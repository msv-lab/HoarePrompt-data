Correctness: **False**

In this case, the code does not fully adhere to the problem description. The output hints indicate that the function `func_1` should accept two parameters `a` and `b`, representing the size of the tree and the edges forming the tree. However, the code only seems to utilize parameter `a` and there is missing logic to construct the list `E`. Additionally, the output hints mention that the function should perform a breadth-first search to count the total number of unique elements encountered, but the code does not implement this logic properly.

Therefore, based on the missing logic and discrepancy between the description and code, the correctness of the program is **False**.
