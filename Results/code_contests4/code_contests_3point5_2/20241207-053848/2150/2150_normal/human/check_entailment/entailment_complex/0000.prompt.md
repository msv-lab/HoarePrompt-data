You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You're given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the size of the tree. 

The next n - 1 lines contain two integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) each, describing the vertices connected by the i-th edge.

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

Output

Output a single integer k — the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size, or -1 if it is impossible to remove edges in order to satisfy this property.

Examples

Input

2 4
4 1

1 3


Output

7 1
8 4
8 10
4 7

Output

4

Input

2
1 2


Output

0

Note

In the first example you can remove the edge between vertices 1 and 4. The graph after that will have two connected components with two vertices in each.

In the second example you can't remove edges in such a way that all components have even number of vertices, so the answer is -1.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1 representing the size of the tree. The input edges (u, v) are such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and form a valid tree structure.**
def func_1(a, b):
    Q = deque()
    Q.append(a)
    seen = {b}
    cnt = 0
    while Q:
        a = Q.popleft()
        
        if a in seen:
            continue
        
        cnt += 1
        
        seen.add(a)
        
        for b in E[a]:
            Q.append(b)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `Q` is empty, `seen` contains all unique elements from `E`, `cnt` is the total number of elements in `E`
    return cnt
    #The program returns the total number of elements in list `E`, which is stored in variable `cnt`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` represents the size of the tree as an integer greater than 1, and parameter `b` represents the edges `(u, v)` forming a valid tree structure. The function performs a breadth-first search on the tree structure defined by the edges, counting the total number of unique elements encountered. The function then returns this count as the total number of elements in list `E`. The code does not fully utilize the `b` parameter and there is a missing logic to construct the list `E`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The given edges form a tree.**
def func_2(node):
    print(node)
    if (node in seen) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The node is not in the seen list
    seen.add(node)
    sz[node] = 1
    for neigh in E[node]:
        print(neigh)
        
        sz[node] += func_2(neigh)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for each iteration of the loop, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and all neighbors of `node` are printed
    return sz[node]
    #The program returns the updated value of sz[node] based on the return value of func_2(neigh)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `node` and performs the following actions:
- If the `node` is already in the `seen` set, it returns 0.
- Otherwise, it adds the `node` to the `seen` set, initializes `sz[node]` to 1, iterates through neighbors of the `node` in the list `E[node`, recursively calls `func_2` on each neighbor, updates `sz[node]` based on the return values, and returns the updated value of `sz[node] at the end.
The function operates under the assumption that the input constraints are met, and the given edges form a tree.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
