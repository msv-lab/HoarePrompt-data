#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1 representing the size of the tree. The input edges (u, v) are such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and form a valid tree structure.**
def func_1(a, b):
    Q = deque()
    Q.append(a)
    seen = {b}
    cnt = 0
    while Q:
        a = Q.popleft()

            continue

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `Q` is empty, `seen` contains all unique elements from `E`, `cnt` is the total number of elements in `E`
    return cnt
    #The program returns the total number of elements in list `E`, which is stored in variable `cnt`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` represents the size of the tree as an integer greater than 1, and parameter `b` represents the edges `(u, v)` forming a valid tree structure. The function performs a breadth-first search on the tree structure defined by the edges, counting the total number of unique elements encountered. The function then returns this count as the total number of elements in list `E`. The code does not fully utilize the `b` parameter and there is a missing logic to construct the list `E`.

def func_2(node):
    print(node)
    if (node in seen) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The node is not in the seen list
    seen.add(node)
    sz[node] = 1
    for neigh in E[node]:
        print(neigh)
        
        sz[node] += func_2(neigh)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for each iteration of the loop, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and all neighbors of `node` are printed
    return sz[node]
    #The program returns the updated value of sz[node] based on the return value of func_2(neigh)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `node` and performs the following actions:
- If the `node` is already in the `seen` set, it returns 0.
- Otherwise, it adds the `node` to the `seen` set, initializes `sz[node]` to 1, iterates through neighbors of the `node` in the list `E[node`, recursively calls `func_2` on each neighbor, updates `sz[node]` based on the return values, and returns the updated value of `sz[node] at the end.
The function operates under the assumption that the input constraints are met, and the given edges form a tree.
