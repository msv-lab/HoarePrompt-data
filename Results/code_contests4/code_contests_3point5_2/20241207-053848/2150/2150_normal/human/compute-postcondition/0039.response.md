According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `Q`. If `Q` is not empty, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped and `b`. To execute the loop again, `Q` needs to be not empty. So for the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must not be empty.
State: **`a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E` plus 1, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped and `b`, `E` is empty, `b` is a value in `E[a]`, and for the loop to execute again `Q` is not empty**
