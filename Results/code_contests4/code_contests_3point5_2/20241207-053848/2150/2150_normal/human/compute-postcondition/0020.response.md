Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves to the next iteration in the loop or the next statement after the loop. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `Q` still contains elements (after dequeuing), `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E`, `E` contains lists of elements that can be accessed using `a` from `seen`, and `a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`**
