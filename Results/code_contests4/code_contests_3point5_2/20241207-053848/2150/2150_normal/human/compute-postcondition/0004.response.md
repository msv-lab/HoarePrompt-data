Example Answer:
The node is added to the set seen. The value of node is not provided, so the set seen will contain the newly added node. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The node is not in the seen list, and the newly added node is in the set seen.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The node is not in the seen list, and the newly added node is in the set seen**
