Example Answer:
`sz[node]` is updated by adding the return value of `func_2(neigh)` to its current value. The specific value of `sz[node]` and the return value of `func_2(neigh)` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the next time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node].
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the next time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node]**
