According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighbors of the `node` in list `E[node]`. If there are more neighbors in the list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and the neighbors of `node` are printed. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `node` must have more neighbors in the list E[node], and one of the neighbors from the list must be printed.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and one of the neighbors of `node` is printed**
