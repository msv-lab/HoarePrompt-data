Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes an integer parameter `node` and performs the following actions:
- If the `node` is already in the `seen` set, it returns 0.
- Otherwise, it adds the `node` to the `seen` set, initializes `sz[node]` to 1, iterates through neighbors of the `node` in the list `E[node`, recursively calls `func_2` on each neighbor, updates `sz[node]` based on the return values, and returns the updated value of `sz[node] at the end.
The function operates under the assumption that the input constraints are met, and the given edges form a tree.**
