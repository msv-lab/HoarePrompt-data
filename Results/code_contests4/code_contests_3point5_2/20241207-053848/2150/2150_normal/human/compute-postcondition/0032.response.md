Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value popped from the left side of the queue `Q`. Since `Q` contains all elements in `E` and `E` is empty, `a` will be assigned the next element in the queue. The variables `b`, `seen`, and `cnt` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E`, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped, `E` is empty and for the loop to execute again `Q` is not empty.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E`, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped, `E` is empty and for the loop to execute again `Q` is not empty**
