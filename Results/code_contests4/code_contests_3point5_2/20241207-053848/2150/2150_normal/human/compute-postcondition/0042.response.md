Output State: **`a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E` plus 1, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped and `b`, `E` is empty, `b` is a value in `E[a]`, `Q` contains only `b`, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to iterate through more elements in `E[a]`, `Q` appends `b`**
