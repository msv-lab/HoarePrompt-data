The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` represents the size of the tree as an integer greater than 1, and parameter `b` represents the edges (u, v) forming a valid tree structure. The function returns the total number of elements in list `E`, which is stored in variable `cnt`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the size of the tree `a` and the edges `b`, and calculate the total number of elements in list `E` and store it in variable `cnt`.
