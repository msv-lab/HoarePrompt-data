Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the neighbors of the node stored in `neigh`. The initial state provides that `node` has neighbors in the list `E[node]`. Therefore, the output state after running the code is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, sz[node] is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and the neighbors of `node` are printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, sz[node] is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and the neighbors of `node` are printed**
