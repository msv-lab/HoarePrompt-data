Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(neigh)` simply prints the value of the variable `neigh`. The variable `neigh` is not defined or initialized in the initial state, so the output state will remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the next time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node]**
