According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `node` and `E[node]`. If there are still neighbors of `node` to iterate over in the list `E[node]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `node` should have neighbors in the list E[node] and one of the neighbors of `node` is printed.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the next time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and one of the neighbors of `node` is printed**
