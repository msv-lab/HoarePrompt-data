Example Answer:
The value of `b` is appended to the list `Q`. Since `b` is a value in `E[a]` and `E` is empty, `b` is the only value in `Q` now. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E` plus 1, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped and `b`, `E` is empty, `b` is a value in `E[a]`, and `Q` contains only `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E` plus 1, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped and `b`, `E` is empty, `b` is a value in `E[a]`, and `Q` contains only `b`**
