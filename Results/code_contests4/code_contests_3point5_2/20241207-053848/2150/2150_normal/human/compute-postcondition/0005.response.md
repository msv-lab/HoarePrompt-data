Example Answer:
`sz[node]` is assigned the value 1. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `node`, the output state will be: `n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, sz[node] is 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, sz[node] is 1**
