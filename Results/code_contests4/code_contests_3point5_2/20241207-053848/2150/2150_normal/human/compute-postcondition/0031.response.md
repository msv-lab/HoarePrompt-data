According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `Q` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `Q` contains all elements in `E` and `E` is empty. To execute the loop one more time, `Q` needs to have at least one element in it. Therefore, one state needs to be adjusted:
State: **`a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E`, `Q` contains all elements in `E`, `E` is empty and for the loop to execute again `Q` is not empty**
