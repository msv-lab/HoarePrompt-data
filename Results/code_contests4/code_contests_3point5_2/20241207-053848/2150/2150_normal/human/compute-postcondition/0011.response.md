Example Answer:
The value of `sz[node]` is updated by adding the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. The specific value of `node` and `neigh` are not provided, so the exact calculation cannot be determined. However, it is clear that `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh) for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and one of the neighbors of `node` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)` for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and one of the neighbors of `node` is printed**
