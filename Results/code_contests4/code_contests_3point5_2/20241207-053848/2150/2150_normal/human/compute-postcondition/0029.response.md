Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the list `Q`. The loop will execute one more time due to the additional element in the list `E[a]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is appended to the list `Q`, there are more elements in the list `E[a]`.
Output State: **`b` is appended to the list `Q`, there are more elements in the list `E[a]`**
