The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `node`, where `node` is an integer. The parameter constraints are that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the given edges form a tree. 

The functionality of the function `func_2` is as follows:
- Case 1: If the program is executed with the input of `node`, it returns 0.
- Case 2: If the program is executed with the input of `node`, it returns the updated value of `sz[node]` based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, where `neigh` is a neighboring node connected to `node`.
