According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `E[a]` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `E` is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to `E[a]` is not empty. Additionally, since `a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, they need to be adjusted to new values. Therefore, the new state should be:
State: **`a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E` plus 1, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped, `E` is empty, `b` is a value in `E[a]` and for the loop to execute again `Q` is not empty**
