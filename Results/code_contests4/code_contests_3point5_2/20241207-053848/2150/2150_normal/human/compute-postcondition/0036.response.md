Example Answer:
The set `seen` adds the element `a`. If `a` is already present in `seen`, the program maintains the same state. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E` plus 1, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped, `E` is empty and for the loop to execute again `Q` is not empty.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E` plus 1, `Q` contains all elements in `E` except for the element popped, `E` is empty and for the loop to execute again `Q` is not empty**
