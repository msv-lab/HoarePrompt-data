Example Answer:
`b` is appended to the list `Q`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is the first element in `E[a]`, `a` is added to `seen`, for the loop to execute the first time all possible combinations between `a` and `b` in `E` have been iterated through, `Q` contains `b`.
Output State: **`b` is the first element in `E[a]`, `a` is added to `seen`, for the loop to execute the first time all possible combinations between `a` and `b` in `E` have been iterated through, `Q` contains `b`**
