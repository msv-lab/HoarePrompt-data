Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `Q` still contains elements, `seen` contains both `a` and `b`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of elements in `E`, `E` contains lists of elements that can be accessed using `a` from `seen`, and `a` and `b` have iterated through all possible combinations in `E`. If `a` is in `seen`, the state remains the same.***
