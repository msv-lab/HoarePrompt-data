Example Answer:
`sz[node]` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. The initial value of `sz[node]` is 1. `neigh` represents the neighbors of `node`. The value of `sz[node]` will be updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`. The newly updated value of `sz[node]` will depend on the specific implementation of `func_2` and the neighbors of `node`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and the neighbors of `node` are printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the node is not in the seen list, the newly added node is in the set seen, `sz[node]` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(neigh)`, for the loop to execute the first time, `node` has neighbors in the list E[node], and the neighbors of `node` are printed**
