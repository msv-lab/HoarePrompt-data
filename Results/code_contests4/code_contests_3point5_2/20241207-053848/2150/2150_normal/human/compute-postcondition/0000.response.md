Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of the variable `node`. As no changes are made to the initial state, the value of `node` remains the same as the initial state which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5**
