Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the girlfriend that Vasya will go to more often based on the provided problem description. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a and b, then calculates the least common multiple of a and b. Finally, it compares the LCM with the minimum and maximum of a and b to determine the girlfriend Vasya will go to more often. The program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output for each case.
