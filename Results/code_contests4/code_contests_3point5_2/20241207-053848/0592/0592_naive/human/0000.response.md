Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the two input numbers a and b, and then compares the frequency of trains going in each direction. If the frequencies are equal, it prints "Equal". If the frequency is higher for a, it prints "Dasha", and if the frequency is higher for b, it prints "Masha". 

The program uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the LCM efficiently and handles the cases where the frequencies are equal, a is less than b, and a is greater than b as described in the problem statement. 

For all the provided examples and additional potential cases, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
