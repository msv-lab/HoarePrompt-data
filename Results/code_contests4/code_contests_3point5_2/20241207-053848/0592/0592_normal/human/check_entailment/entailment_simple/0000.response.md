Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers 'a' and 'b'. This algorithm is used to efficiently find the gcd of two numbers which is a necessary step in determining the frequency of trains going to Dasha and Masha's directions. The program does not directly solve the problem described, but it provides a crucial step in calculating the correct output.
