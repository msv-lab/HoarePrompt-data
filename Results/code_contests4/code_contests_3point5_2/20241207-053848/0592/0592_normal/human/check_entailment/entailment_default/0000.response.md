Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints indicate that the function `func_1` recursively calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the code provided in the program does not accurately implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. This discrepancy makes the code incorrect as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
