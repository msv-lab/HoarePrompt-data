You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer. For each query, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. The string s consists of characters '.' and 'X' with a length between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5.**
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = func_3()
        
        s = list(input())
        
        s.append('X')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        this = 0
        
        flag = False
        
        try:
            for c in s:
                if c == 'X' and this > 0:
                    if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this:
                        raise
                    if 2 * b <= this:
                        if flag:
                            raise
                        flag = True
                        if this < a:
                            raise
                    cnt += 1
                    this = 0
                elif c == '.':
                    this += 1
            print('NO' if cnt % 2 else 'YES')
        except:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` and `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end. `cnt` will be the total count of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, `this` will be 0 after each occurrence of 'X'. `flag` will be True if 2 * `b` is less than or equal to `this` at any point in the loop. The code will print 'NO' if `cnt` is even and 'YES' if `cnt` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple queries, each consisting of parameters `q`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. It iterates through the queries, calculates the count of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, and prints 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if it is even. The code handles the cases where specific conditions related to `a` and `b` are met during the iteration. If any of the conditions are violated, it prints 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` evaluates to True. After all iterations have completed, `x` will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` will be 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, where `y` becomes 0 after executing the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the loop, the program returns the GCD of `x` and `y`, where `y` becomes 0. The functionality accurately reflects the code logic.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values after splitting them
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values, splits them, converts them to integers, and returns a list of these integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values after splitting them.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a string s of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5 consisting of characters . and X.**
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by calling function func_4 with arguments unpacked from dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty, otherwise calling function f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts a function `f` as a parameter. It returns a list of values calculated by calling function `func_4` with arguments unpacked from dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty. If dim is empty, it returns the result of calling function `f()`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' and ending at 'start + step * count' with a step size of 'step'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters: start, step, and count, and returns a range starting from 'start' and ending at 'start + step * count' with a step size of 'step'. The function does not handle cases where step is 0, which would result in an invalid range.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_6 accepts a list 'l', an integer 'start', and an integer 'end'. It returns a range starting from 'start' to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'. However, the code does not handle cases where 'start' or 'end' are negative, which could lead to unexpected results or errors. It also does not account for cases where 'l' is empty, potentially causing issues with the range calculation.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the result of 2 raised to the power of (n - 1)'s bit length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts an integer parameter n and returns the result of 2 raised to the power of the bit length of (n - 1).

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: - q is a positive integer.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r using integer division
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters x and r where q is a positive integer. It calculates the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r using integer division.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
