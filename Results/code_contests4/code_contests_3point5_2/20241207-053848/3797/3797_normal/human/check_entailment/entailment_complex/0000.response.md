Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` processes the queries and determines if Alice can win based on the conditions provided. However, there are inconsistencies in the implementation that do not align with the problem description:

1. The code does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob accurately. The problem states that Alice moves first and then Bob, but the code does not explicitly differentiate between the two players in the logic.
2. The conditions for selecting substrings of length a and b are not enforced correctly. The code checks for specific conditions related to a and b during the iteration, but it does not ensure that Alice and Bob take turns selecting substrings as required by the game rules.
3. The code does not consider the optimal strategy for both players. It simplifies the decision-making process without considering the strategic aspects mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the code does not fully simulate the game described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
