Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` attempts to determine if Alice can win the game by processing multiple queries, each consisting of parameters `q`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. It iterates through the queries, calculating the count of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, and prints 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if it is even. The code handles specific conditions related to `a` and `b` during the iteration, such as checking if certain ranges of `a` and `b` are met.

However, there is a potential issue with the program logic in the `func_1` function. The conditions and calculations within the function may not accurately determine the winner in all scenarios, as there could be cases where Alice cannot win even if the count of occurrences is odd. This discrepancy between the code logic and the expected outcome based on the problem description suggests that the program is not correct for all potential cases.
