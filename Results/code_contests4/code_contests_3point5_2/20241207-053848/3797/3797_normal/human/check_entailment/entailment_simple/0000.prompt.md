You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length a, and Bob must select a substring of length b. It is guaranteed that a > b.

For example, if s = ...X.. and a = 3, b = 2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s = ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX.

Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each query contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), consisting of only characters . and X.

It is guaranteed that sum of all |s| over all queries not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


3
3 2
XX......XX...X
4 2
X...X.X..X
5 3
.......X..X


Output


YES
NO
YES

Note

In the first query Alice can select substring s_3 ... s_5. After that s turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter what move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move), but Bob can't make his second move.

In the second query Alice can not win because she cannot even make one move.

In the third query Alice can choose substring s_2 ... s_6. After that s turns into .XXXXX.X..X, and Bob can't make a move after that.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

                if c == 'X' and this > 0:
                    if b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this:

            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` and `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end. `cnt` will be the total count of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, `this` will be 0 after each occurrence of 'X'. `flag` will be True if 2 * `b` is less than or equal to `this` at any point in the loop. The code will print 'NO' if `cnt` is even and 'YES' if `cnt` is odd.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` evaluates to True. After all iterations have completed, `x` will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` will be 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`, where `y` becomes 0 after executing the loop

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values after splitting them

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a string s of length at most 3 ⋅ 10^5 consisting of characters . and X.**
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values calculated by calling function func_4 with arguments unpacked from dim[1:], repeated dim[0] times if dim is not empty, otherwise calling function f()

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' and ending at 'start + step * count' with a step size of 'step'

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range starting from 'start' to the length of list 'l' plus 'end'

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the result of 2 raised to the power of (n - 1)'s bit length.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: - q is a positive integer.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the result of the expression (x + r - 1) divided by r using integer division


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
