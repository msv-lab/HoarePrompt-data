The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the loop, the program returns the GCD of `x` and `y`, where `y` becomes 0. The functionality accurately reflects the code logic.
