The function `func_1` processes multiple queries, each consisting of parameters `q`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. It iterates through the queries, calculates the count of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, and prints 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if it is even. The code handles the cases where specific conditions related to `a` and `b` are met during the iteration. If any of the conditions are violated, it prints 'NO'.
