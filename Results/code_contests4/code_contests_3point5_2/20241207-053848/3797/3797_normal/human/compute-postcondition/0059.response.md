An exception could occur at any point in the loop if any of the conditions for raising an exception are met. The try except statement checks for these exceptions and prints 'NO' if any exception is raised.

Therefore, the output state after the execution of the try statement is: 
Output State: **`q` and `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end. `cnt` will be the number of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, `this` will be 0 after each occurrence of 'X'. `flag` will be True if 2 * `b` is less than or equal to `this` at any point in the loop. The code will print 'NO' if `cnt` is even and 'YES' if `cnt` is odd.**
