Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer, `_` is within the range of the input integer, `a` and `b` are returned from the function `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `c` is 'X', `this` is set based on the new value of `c`, `flag` is True, `c` is the next character in the list `s`. If `this` is less than `a`, an exception is raised if `flag` is true and `b <= this < a` or `a + 4 * b - 1 <= this`.***
