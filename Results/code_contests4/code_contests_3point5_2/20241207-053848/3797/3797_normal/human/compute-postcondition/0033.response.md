Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `_` is within the range of the input integer, `a` and `b` are returned from the function `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `c` is 'X', `this` is set to 0 if `c` is 'X', `flag` is True. If b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this, the program executes the if block. The program raises an exception and stops execution at this point.**
