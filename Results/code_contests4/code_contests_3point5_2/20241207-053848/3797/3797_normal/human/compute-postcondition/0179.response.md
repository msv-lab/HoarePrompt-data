A `RuntimeError` could be triggered at any point in the program where a `raise` statement is encountered in the `try` block. The `try` except statement is checking the characters in the string `s` and performing certain operations based on the conditions specified. If any of the conditions are met that require a `raise` statement, a `RuntimeError` is raised. 
The `except` block catches any `RuntimeError` and prints 'NO'. 
Therefore, the output state after the try statement is: `q`, `_`, `s` with 'X' appended, `cnt` is either even or odd for 'YES' or 'NO', `a` and `b` updated based on func_3(), `this` is either 0 or 1, `flag` is either True or False. The output of the print statement is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `cnt` is even or odd.
