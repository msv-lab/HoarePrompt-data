Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer, `_` is within the range of the input integer, `a` and `b` are returned from the function `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `c` is 'X', `this` is set to 0 if `c` is 'X'. If `c` is not 'X', `cnt` remains the same, and `this` remains less than or equal to 0. `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in the list `s`.***
