Output State: **`q`, `_` are positive integers, `a`, `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string excluding the last 'X', `cnt` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the if statement, `this` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the if statement, `flag` is True, `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` is a list of characters from the input string excluding the last 'X', and `c` is the next character in the list. If `c` is '.', `this` is increased by 1. If `b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this`, the program encounters an exception and raises it. No changes occur to the state of the variables after the execution of the if else block.**
