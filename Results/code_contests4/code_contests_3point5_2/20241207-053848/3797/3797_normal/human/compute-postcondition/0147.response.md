Postcondition: ***`q`, `_`, `s` with 'X' appended, `cnt` is either even or odd for 'YES' or 'NO', `a` and `b` updated based on func_3(), `this` is either 0 or 1, `flag` is either True or False, for the loop to execute `s` is not empty. If `c` is 'X' and `this` > 0, then `flag` is True. If `c` is not 'X' and `this` <= 0, then `flag` is False. If the character `c` is 'X', `this` is updated to 0. If the character `c` is not 'X', `this` remains 1.***
