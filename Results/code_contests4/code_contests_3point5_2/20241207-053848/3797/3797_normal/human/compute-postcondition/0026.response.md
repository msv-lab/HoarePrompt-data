Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer, `_` is within the range of the input integer, `a` and `b` are returned from the function `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is initialized to 0, `this` is assigned the value 1 if `c` is '.', `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in the list `s`. If `c` is not '.', `this` remains less than or equal to 0.***
