A `RuntimeError` exception could be triggered at any point in the program where a `raise` statement is encountered. The `try` block iterates through the characters in the list `s`, incrementing `cnt` based on certain conditions, updating `this`, and setting `flag` accordingly. At the end of the `try` block, it prints 'NO' if `cnt` is an odd number, otherwise it prints 'YES'.

Therefore, the `try` except statement is used to handle any `RuntimeError` exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the code. It prints 'NO' if an exception occurs.

Output State: **`q`, `_` are positive integers, `a`, `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string excluding the last 'X', `cnt` is the total count of occurrences where 'X' is preceded by a positive number of '.', `this` is 0, `flag` is True if there is an occurrence where `this` >= 2 * b and `this` < a, otherwise it is False. `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`. The code prints 'NO' if cnt is an odd number, otherwise it prints 'YES'.**
