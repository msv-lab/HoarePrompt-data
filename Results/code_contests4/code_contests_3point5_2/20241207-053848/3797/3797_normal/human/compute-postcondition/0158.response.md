Output State: `q`, `_`, `s` with 'X' appended, `cnt` is either even or odd for 'YES' or 'NO', `a` and `b` updated based on func_3(), `this` is 0, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute again `s` is not empty. If `b` <= `this` < `a` or `a` + 4 * `b` - 1 <= `this`, a `RuntimeError` is raised when `flag` is True. If `this` is less than `a`, the program retains the initial state described in the precondition. `cnt` is incremented by 1.
