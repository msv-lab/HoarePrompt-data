Postcondition: ***`q`, `_` are positive integers, `a`, `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the if statement, `this` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the if statement, `flag` is True if `c` is 'X' and `this` > 0, otherwise it is False. `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end. The character `c` is the first character in the list, and it is either 'X' or not 'X' based on the condition in the if statement.***
