Postcondition: ***`q`, `_` are positive integers, `a`, `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is 0, `this` is 0, `flag` is True, `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `c` is the first character in the list. The character `c` is 'X' and the value of `this` is greater than 0. If `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, and if `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this`, and if `2 * b <= this`, and `flag` is True, the program raises an exception. If `this` is less than `a`, then no changes occur in the program variables.***
