Postcondition: ***`q`, `_`, `s`, `cnt`, `a`, `b`, `this`, `flag` are all appended with 'X'. If `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, or `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this`, the loop will execute one more time. If the flag is true, a 'raise' statement is encountered causing an exception to be raised and potentially terminating the program abruptly.***
