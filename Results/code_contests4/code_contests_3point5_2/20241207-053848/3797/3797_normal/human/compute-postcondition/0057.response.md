Output State: **`q`, `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end. `cnt` will be the number of occurrences where 'X' is followed by a number greater than 0, `this` will be 0 after each occurrence of 'X'. `flag` will be True if 2 * `b` is less than or equal to `this` at any point in the loop. If any of the conditions for raising an exception are met, the loop will stop. The code will print 'NO' if `cnt` is even and 'YES' if `cnt` is odd.**
