According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y`. If `y` evaluates to True, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the initial state, and for the loop to execute again, `y` should still evaluate to True. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **Values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the initial state, for the loop to execute again `y` should still evaluate to True**
