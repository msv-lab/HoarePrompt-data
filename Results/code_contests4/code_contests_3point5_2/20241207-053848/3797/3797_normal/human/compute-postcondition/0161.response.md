Postcondition: ***`q`, `_`, `s` with 'X' appended, `cnt` is either even or odd for 'YES' or 'NO', `a` and `b` updated based on func_3(), `this` is either 0 or 1, `flag` is either True or False, for the loop to execute again `s` is not empty. If `c` == 'X' and `this` > 0, the postcondition is dependent on the values of `a`, `b`, and `this`. If `b` <= `this` < `a` or `a` + 4 * `b` - 1 <= `this`, a `RuntimeError` is raised when `flag` is True. If `this` is less than `a`, the program retains the initial state described in the precondition and `cnt` is incremented by 1. If `c` != 'X' or `this` <= 0, then `this` is incremented by 1, and the state of the program is updated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `flag`.***
