The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is supposed to handle multiple queries with the given constraints. For each query, the function will take in three parameters: a positive integer `q`, two positive integers `a` and `b` where 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a string `s` consisting of characters '.' and 'X' with a length between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5. The function will process each query and produce the corresponding output based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` handles multiple queries, each with parameters `q`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. The function processes the queries and produces the corresponding output based on the given constraints.**
