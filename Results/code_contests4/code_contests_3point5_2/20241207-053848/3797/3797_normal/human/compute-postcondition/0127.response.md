According to the code, the loop will execute based on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. The variables that need to be adjusted before the loop starts are as follows:
- `a` and `b` should be updated based on the return values of `func_3()`.
- `cnt` should be even or odd based on which 'NO' or 'YES' will be printed.
- `s` should have 'X' appended to it.
- `this` should be assigned the value 0.
- `flag` should be set to False.

State: **`q`, `_`, `s` with 'X' appended, `cnt` is even or odd for 'YES' or 'NO', `a` and `b` updated based on func_3(), `this` is 0, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute `s` is not empty**
