Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped, and `x` is assigned the value of the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The new values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the initial state information. For the loop to execute again, `y` should still evaluate to True.
Output State: **Values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the initial state, for the loop to execute again `y` should still evaluate to True**
