Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer, `_` is within the range of the input integer, `a` and `b` are returned from the function `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is initialized to 0, `this` is assigned a value greater than 0, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in the list `s`, the character `c` is 'X', the value of `this` is greater than 0. If the condition `(b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this)` is true, then a `raise` statement is encountered, causing an exception and halting the program.***
