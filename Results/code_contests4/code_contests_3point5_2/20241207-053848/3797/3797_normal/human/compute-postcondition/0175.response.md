Postcondition: ***`q`, `_`, `s`, `cnt`, `a`, `b`, `this`, and `flag` are program variables. If `c` is 'X' and `this` > 0, then `q`, `_`, `s` are 'X', `cnt` is 'X + 1', `a`, `b` are 'X', `this` is 0, `flag` is 'X' appended. If `c` is not 'X' or `this` is not greater than 0, then `q`, `_`, `s` are 'X', `cnt`, `a`, `b` are 0, `this` is 1, `flag` is 0. After the execution of the if else block, the program variables remain unchanged as their initial values satisfy the conditions specified for the loop to execute one more time.***
