Example Answer: 
`func_3()` returns two values which are assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` and `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt`, `this`, and `flag` remain the same, `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`.
Output State: **`q` and `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt`, `this`, and `flag` remain the same, `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`**
