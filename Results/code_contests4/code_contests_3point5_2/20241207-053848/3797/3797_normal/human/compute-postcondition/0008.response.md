The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. After executing the loop, the program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y, where `y` becomes 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `x` and `y`, and return the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y` while ensuring `y` becomes 0 after the loop execution.
