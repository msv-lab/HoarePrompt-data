Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer, `_` is within the range of the input integer, `a` and `b` are returned from the function `func_3()`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `c` is 'X', `this` is set to 0 if `c` is 'X', `flag` is True. If `b` <= `this` < `a` or `a` + 4 * `b` - 1 <= `this`, the program raises an exception and stops execution. If `this` < `a`, the function continues execution.***
