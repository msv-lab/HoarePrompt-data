Postcondition: ***`q`, `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end. If `c` is 'X' and `this` > 0, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `this` is set to 0, `flag` is True, and `c` is the next character in the list `s`. If `c` is not 'X' or `this` <= 0, then `cnt` is increased by 1 if `c` is 'X', `this` is set based on the new value of `c`, `flag` is updated based on the conditions, `c` is the next character in the list `s`, and `this` is increased by 1 if `c` is '.'.***
