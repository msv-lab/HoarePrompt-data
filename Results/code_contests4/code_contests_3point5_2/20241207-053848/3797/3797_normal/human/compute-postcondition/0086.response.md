Postcondition: ***`q` and `_` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are within the range of the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end, `cnt` is 0, `this` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the if statement, `flag` is False, `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a list of characters from the input string with 'X' appended at the end. The character `c` is the first character in the list, and it is not 'X'.***
