Postcondition: ***`q`, `_`, `a`, `b` are positive integers. `s` is a list of characters from the input string excluding the last 'X'. `cnt` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the if statement. `this` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the if statement. `flag` is True if `c` is 'X' and `this` > 0, otherwise it is False. `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` is a list of characters from the input string excluding the last 'X', and `c` is the next character in the list. If `b <= this < a or a + 4 * b - 1 <= this`, the program raises an exception. If `this < a`, the program raises an exception. If `2 * b <= this`, the program continues without any exceptions.***
