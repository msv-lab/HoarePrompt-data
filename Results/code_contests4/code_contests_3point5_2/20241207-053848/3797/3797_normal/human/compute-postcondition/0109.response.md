Postcondition: ***`q`, `_` are positive integers. `a`, `b` are within the range of the input integer. `s` is a list of characters from the input string excluding the last 'X'. `cnt` is either 0 or 1. `this` is either 0 or 1. `flag` is True. `a` and `b` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()`. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` is a list of characters from the input string excluding the last 'X'. If `c` is '.', `this` is increased by 1. If `this < a`, the program continues. If `b <= this < a` or `a + 4 * b - 1 <= this`, an exception is encountered and raised.***
