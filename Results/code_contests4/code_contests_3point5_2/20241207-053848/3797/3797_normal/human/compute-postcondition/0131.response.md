Postcondition: ***`q`, `_`, `s` with 'X' appended, `cnt` is even or odd for 'YES' or 'NO', `a` and `b` updated based on func_3(), `this` is greater than 0, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute `s` is not empty, `c` is 'X'. If `b` is less than or equal to `this` and `this` is less than `a`, then the program runs without exceptions. If `a + 4 * b - 1` is less than or equal to `this`, then an exception of type `RuntimeError` is raised.***
