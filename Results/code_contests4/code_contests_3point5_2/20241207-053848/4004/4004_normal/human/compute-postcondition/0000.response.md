Example Answer:
The code checks if the input provided by the user is either 'a', 'i', 'u', 'e', or 'o'. If the input matches any of these vowels, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Since the initial state does not provide any specific input value, the output state will be dependent on the user's input.
Output State: **c is a lowercase English letter, the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the user input**
