Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The program is supposed to print "vowel" if the input letter is a vowel and "consonant" if it is not. However, the program prints "YES" if the input letter is a vowel and "NO" if it is not. This does not match the expected output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
