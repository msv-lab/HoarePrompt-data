Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. While the code correctly determines if the input is a vowel or consonant, the output should be "vowel" or "consonant" as per the problem description. The code outputs "YES" or "NO" instead. This inconsistency makes the code incorrect.
