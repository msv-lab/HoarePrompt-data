Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not generate a permutation of length n where there is no index i such that p_i = i. Instead, it seems to be trying to generate some sequence based on odd and even conditions, which does not align with the problem requirements.

An example where the program fails:
Input:
2
3
4

Expected Output:
3 1 2
4 1 2 3

Output by the program:
3
4

Since the program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is False.
