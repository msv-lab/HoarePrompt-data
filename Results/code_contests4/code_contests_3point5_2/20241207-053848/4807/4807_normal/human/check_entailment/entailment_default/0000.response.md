Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is supposed to generate a permutation of length n such that there is no index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where p_i = i. However, the code provided in the program does not satisfy this condition.

For example, when the input is 2, the code outputs "2 1" which does not satisfy the condition that p_i ≠ i for all i from 1 to n.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not produce the correct output for all test cases according to the problem description.
