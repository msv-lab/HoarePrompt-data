Example Answer:
`g` is appended with the string representation of `s`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 1, `b` is an even number, `g` is appended with a space character and the string representation of `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 1, `b` is an even number, `g` is appended with a space character and the string representation of `s`**
