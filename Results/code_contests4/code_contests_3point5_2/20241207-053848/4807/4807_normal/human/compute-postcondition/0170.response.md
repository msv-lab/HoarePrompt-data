Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value of `g` plus the string representation of `s`. The value of `s` is an integer greater than 0, so after concatenation, `g` will have two spaces added to it followed by the string representation of `s`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has two spaces added to it and the string representation of `s`, `b` remains an odd integer.
Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has two spaces added to it and the string representation of `s`, `b` remains an odd integer**
