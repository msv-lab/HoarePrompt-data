Example Answer: 
`g` is concatenated with a space character, so the space character is added to the end of the current value of `g`. The previous value of `g` is `g` is appended with the value of `s - 1` converted to a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, for the loop to execute again `s` after decreasing by 2 is greater than 1, `g` is concatenated with a space character and `g` is appended with the value of `s - 1` converted to a string with an additional space at the end.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, for the loop to execute again `s` after decreasing by 2 is greater than 1, `g` is concatenated with a space character and `g` is appended with the value of `s - 1` converted to a string with an additional space at the end**.
