Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, `s` is decreased by 2, `g` is concatenated with a space character and the string representation of `s` if `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
