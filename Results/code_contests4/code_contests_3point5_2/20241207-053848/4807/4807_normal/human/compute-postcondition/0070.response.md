Example Answer:
`g` is concatenated with the string representation of `s`, so `g` will have the previous value of `g` with the string representation of `s` added to it. The value of `s` is decreased by 1, and `g` is concatenated with a space. Therefore, the Output State is: s is decreased by 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is an input integer, i is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 1, b is an even number, g is concatenated with a space.
Output State: **s is decreased by 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is an input integer, i is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 1, b is an even number, g is concatenated with a space**
