Functionality: **The function reads an integer input `a`, then for `a` number of times, it reads an integer `b`, and based on whether `b` is even or odd, it constructs a string `g` that represents a sequence of decreasing even numbers or odd numbers with spaces in between and additional spaces at the end. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.**
