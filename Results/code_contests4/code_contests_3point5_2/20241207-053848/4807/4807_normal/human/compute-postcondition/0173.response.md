Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than 0 and reduced by 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has two spaces added to it and the string representation of `s`, `b` remains an odd integer. The if condition checks if `s` is equal to half of `b` plus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
