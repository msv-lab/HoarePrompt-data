Example Answer: 
The variable `g` is concatenated with a space character. Since `g` is a string with the value of `b` concatenated to the end, the resulting string after concatenation will have an extra space at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is `b - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer (even), `g` is a string with the value of `b` concatenated to the end, followed by a space character.
Output State: **`s` is `b - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer (even), `g` is a string with the value of `b` concatenated to the end, followed by a space character**
