Example Answer:
The string `g` is concatenated with a space character. The string `g` already had a space added to it, so now it will have two spaces. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has two spaces added to it, `b` remains an odd integer.
Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has two spaces added to it, `b` remains an odd integer**
