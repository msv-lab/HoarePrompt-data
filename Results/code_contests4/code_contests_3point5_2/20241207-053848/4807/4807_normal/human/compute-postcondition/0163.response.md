Output State: **`s` is an integer, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has a space added to it. If `s` equals 0, `s` is decreased by 2 and `g` is updated by adding the string representation of `s - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
