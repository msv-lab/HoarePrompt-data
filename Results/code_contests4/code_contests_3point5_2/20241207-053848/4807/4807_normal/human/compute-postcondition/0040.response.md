Example Answer:
The value of `g` is concatenated with the string representation of `s`, which is decreased by 2. The previous value of `s` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, `s` is decreased by 2, `g` is concatenated with a space character and the string representation of `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, `s` is decreased by 2, `g` is concatenated with a space character and the string representation of `s`**
