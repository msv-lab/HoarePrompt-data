Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `b`, `g` is the string representation of `b` concatenated with the string representations of all numbers from `b` to 2 with spaces in between. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, a space is appended to `g` and `s` is concatenated to `g` as a string, `g` has a space appended to it, `g` is concatenated with the string representation of `s`. `print(g)` is executed. for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `a`**
