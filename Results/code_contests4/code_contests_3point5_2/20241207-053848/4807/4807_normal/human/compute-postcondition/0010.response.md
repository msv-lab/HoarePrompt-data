Example Answer:
The string `g` is concatenated with a space. The previous value of `g` is the string representation of `b`. Therefore, after execution, `g` will have an additional space at the end. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is assigned the value of `b - 1`, `g` is the string representation of `b` with an additional space at the end**
