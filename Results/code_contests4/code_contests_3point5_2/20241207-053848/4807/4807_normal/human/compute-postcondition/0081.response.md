Example Answer: 
`s` is decremented by 1. The value of `s` was greater than 1, so after execution, `s` is now less than the previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is now less than the previous value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an odd number, `g` contains the string representation of consecutive decreasing even numbers starting from `b` with spaces in between.
Output State: **`s` is now less than the previous value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an odd number, `g` contains the string representation of consecutive decreasing even numbers starting from `b` with spaces in between**
