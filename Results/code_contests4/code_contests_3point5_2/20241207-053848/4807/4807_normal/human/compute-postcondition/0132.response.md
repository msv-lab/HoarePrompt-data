Example Answer:
The string `g` has a space character concatenated to the end. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`s` is `b - 1 - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer (even), `g` is a string with the value of `b` concatenated to the end, followed by a space character and then concatenated with the string representation of `s` for the loop to execute again `s` - 1 > 0 and b % 2 == 0 with an extra space character at the end.**
