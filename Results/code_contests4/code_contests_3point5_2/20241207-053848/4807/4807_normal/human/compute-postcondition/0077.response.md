Example Answer:
The variable `g` is updated by appending a space character to its current value. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State is: `s` is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `s` is greater than 1, `b` is still an even number, `g` has a space character appended to its current value.
Output State: **`s` is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `s` is greater than 1, `b` is still an even number, `g` has a space character appended to its current value**
