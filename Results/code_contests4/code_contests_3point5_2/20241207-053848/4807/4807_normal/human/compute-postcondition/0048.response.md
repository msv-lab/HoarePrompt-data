Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, for the loop to execute again `s` after decreasing by 2 is greater than 1, `g` is concatenated with a space character and the string representation of `s` if `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1, `s` is decremented by 1**
