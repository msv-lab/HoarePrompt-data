Postcondition: ***`s` is less than the previous value, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an odd number, `g` contains the string representation of consecutive decreasing even numbers starting from `b` with spaces in between and an additional space is added to the end. If `s` equals to `b // 2 + 1`, `g` is appended with the string representation of `s` and an extra space. After the if condition `s` is equal to 0, and the overall program state is updated accordingly.***
