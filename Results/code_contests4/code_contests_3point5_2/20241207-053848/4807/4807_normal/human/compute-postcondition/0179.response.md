Example Answer:
`i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: s is an integer greater than 0 and reduced by 2, n is an integer greater than 1, a is an input integer, i is less than a and increased by 1, b is an input odd integer, g has two spaces added to it along with the string representations of the numbers from b - 1 down to b - k, loop control variable k is equal to the number of times the loop executed.
