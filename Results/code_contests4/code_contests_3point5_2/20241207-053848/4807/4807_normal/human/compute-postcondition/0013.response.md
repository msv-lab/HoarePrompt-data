Example Answer:
`s` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is greater than 1, so after execution, `s` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 1 and `b` is an even number.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 1 and `b` is an even number**
