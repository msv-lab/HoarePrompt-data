Postcondition: ***`s` is equal to `b - k` - 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has a space added to it, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is less than `b` and `b - k > 1. Additionally, if `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1, then `g` is concatenated with the string representation of `s - 1`, `g` is concatenated with the string representation of `s`.***
