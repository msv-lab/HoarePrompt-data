Postcondition: ***`s` is equal to `b - k` - 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` is a string with specific values, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is less than `b` and `b - k > 1. Additionally, `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`***
