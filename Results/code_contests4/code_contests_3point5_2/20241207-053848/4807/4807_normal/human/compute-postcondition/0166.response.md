Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `s` was an integer greater than 1, so after execution, `s` is an integer greater than 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has a space added to it, and `b` remains an odd integer.
Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input odd integer, `g` has a space added to it, and `b` remains an odd integer**
