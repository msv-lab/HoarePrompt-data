Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, `s` is 0, `g` is the string representation of `b` concatenated with the string representations of all numbers from `b` to 2 with spaces in between. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, a space is appended to `g` and `s` is concatenated to `g` as a string, `g` has a space appended to it.**
