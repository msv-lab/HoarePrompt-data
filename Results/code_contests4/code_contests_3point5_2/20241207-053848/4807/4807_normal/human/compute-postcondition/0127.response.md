Example Answer: 
`s` is decremented by 1, and the previous value of `s` is `b`, so after execution, `s` becomes `b - 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is `b - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer (even), `g` is a string with the value of `b` concatenated to the end.
Output State: **`s` is `b - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer (even), `g` is a string with the value of `b` concatenated to the end**
