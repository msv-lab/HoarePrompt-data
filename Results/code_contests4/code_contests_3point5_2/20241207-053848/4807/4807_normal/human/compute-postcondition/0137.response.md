Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is `b - 1 - 2`, which means `s` is `b - 3`. Then `g` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `s` to it. Since `s` is `b - 3`, the updated `g` will have the new `b` value followed by a space character and then `b - 3`. Additionally, an extra space character is added at the end of `g`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is `b - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer (even), `g` is a string with the updated value as described.
Output State: **`s` is `b - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is less than `a`, `b` is an input integer (even), `g` is a string with the updated value as described**
