Example Answer:
The value of `g` is concatenated with a space character. The previous value of `g` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, for the loop to execute again `s` after decreasing by 2 is greater than 1, `g` is concatenated with a space character.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an odd number, for the loop to execute again `s` after decreasing by 2 is greater than 1, `g` is concatenated with a space character**
