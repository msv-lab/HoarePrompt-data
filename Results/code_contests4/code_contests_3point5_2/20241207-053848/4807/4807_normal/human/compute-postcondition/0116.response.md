Output State: `s` is decreased by 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an odd number, `g` contains the updated string representation of consecutive decreasing even numbers with spaces in between and an additional space at the end, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 3 and `b` remains an odd number. If `s` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, then `s` is decreased by 2. If `s` equals 0, then the program enters this block. `g` gets appended with a space.
