Postcondition: ***`loadings` is incremented and assigned the value of `w[i]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `truckCnt` is incremented by an unknown value. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`.***
