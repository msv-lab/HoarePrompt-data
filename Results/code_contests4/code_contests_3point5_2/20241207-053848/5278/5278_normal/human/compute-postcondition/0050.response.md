Example Answer:
The value of `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`, where `w[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `w`. The values of `loadings`, `middle`, and `truckCnt` are incremented by 1. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n+1`. There is no mention of `k` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` and `truckCnt` are increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be less than `n+1`.
Output State: **`loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` and `truckCnt` are increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be less than `n+1`**
