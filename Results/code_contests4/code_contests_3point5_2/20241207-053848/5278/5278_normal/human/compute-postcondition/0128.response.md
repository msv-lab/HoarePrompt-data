Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`, if `middle` is less than `loadings` and `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `loadings` is then assigned the value of `w[i]`. Since we are only incrementing `i` in this code snippet, the affected variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`, if `middle` is less than `loadings` and `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`.
Output State: **`loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`, if `middle` is less than `loadings` and `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`**
