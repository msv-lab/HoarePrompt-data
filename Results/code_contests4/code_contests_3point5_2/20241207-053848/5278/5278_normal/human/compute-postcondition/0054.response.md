Example Answer:
`loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, where `i` is the index of the weight in list `w`. The values of `middle` and `truckCnt` are increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`. 
Output State: **`loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` and `truckCnt` are increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`**
