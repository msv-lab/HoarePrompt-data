Example Answer:
`truckCnt` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown. Therefore, after execution, `truckCnt` will have a value greater than the previous value. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`loadings` is incremented and assigned the value of `w[i]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i` is incremented by 1, `truckCnt` is incremented by an unknown value**
