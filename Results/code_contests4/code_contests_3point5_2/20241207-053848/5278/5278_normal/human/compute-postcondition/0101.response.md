Output State: **`loadings` holds the sum of all elements in `w` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `middle` is assigned the value of `minP`, `truckCnt` holds the number of times `middle < loadings` was true, `n` remains the same, `i` is equal to `n`, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, `left` remains the same, `right` remains the same. The loop breaks when `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`. Additionally, `(truckCnt + 1 <= k)` is true**
