According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the input integer `num`, `i` is 0, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending, and if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration requires the following adjustments:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the input integer `num`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending, if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`**
