Example Answer:
minP is assigned the value of middle. The value of middle is not given in the initial state, so the output state is: 'loadings' is the sum of all input integers, 'middle' remains the same, 'truckCnt' is the number of trucks needed to carry the load, 'n' remains the same, 'i' is equal to n, the sum of 'truckCnt' and 1 is less than or equal to k, minP is assigned the value of middle.
Output State: **'loadings' is the sum of all input integers, 'middle' remains the same, 'truckCnt' is the number of trucks needed to carry the load, 'n' remains the same, 'i' is equal to n, the sum of 'truckCnt' and 1 is less than or equal to k, minP is assigned the value of middle**
