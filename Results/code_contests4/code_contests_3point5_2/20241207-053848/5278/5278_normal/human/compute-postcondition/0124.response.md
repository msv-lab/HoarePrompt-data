Example Answer: 
The value of `truckCnt` is increased by 1, but the code snippet contains a `break` statement which will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the value of `truckCnt` remains incremented by 1, and we break out of the loop or if statement.
Output State: **variable `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
