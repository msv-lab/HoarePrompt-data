Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `loadings` will hold the sum of all elements in `w` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `middle` will be assigned the value of `minP`, `truckCnt` will hold the number of times `middle < loadings` was true, `n` will remain the same, `i` will be equal to `n`, `minP` will be assigned the value of `middle`, `left` will remain the same, `right` will remain the same. The loop will break when `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`. Additionally, `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`***
