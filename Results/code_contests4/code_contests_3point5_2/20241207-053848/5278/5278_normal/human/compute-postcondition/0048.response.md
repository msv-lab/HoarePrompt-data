Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: 'loadings' is increased by the value of w[i], 'middle' and 'truckCnt' are increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be less than n+1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
