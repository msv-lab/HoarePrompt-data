According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers, `sumW` is the sum of all input integers, `w` contains all input integers, `i` is 0, `minP` is 0, the condition (1 == k) is false, n is not equal to k, `left` is assigned the value of `maxW`, `right` is assigned the value 1000000, for the loop to execute the first time left is less than or equal to right, `middle` is assigned the value of the floor division of the sum of `left` and `right` by 2, `truckCnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `loadings` is 0**
