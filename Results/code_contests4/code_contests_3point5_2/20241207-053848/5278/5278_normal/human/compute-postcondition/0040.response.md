Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: loadings is increased by the value of w[i], 'middle' is less than 'loadings', truckCnt is increased by 1, k is less than truckCnt + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **loadings is increased by the value of w[i], 'middle' is less than 'loadings', truckCnt is increased by 1, k is less than truckCnt + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
