Example Answer:
The value of `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`. The values of `loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `n`, `i`, `minP`, `left`, and `k` remain the same. The condition `truckCnt + 1` is still less than or equal to `k`, and `k` is not less than `truckCnt + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is the sum of all values in `w`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `n` remains the same, `i` is equal to `n`, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1` or `middle`, `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`, `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is not less than `truckCnt + 1`.
Output State: **`loadings` is the sum of all values in `w`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `n` remains the same, `i` is equal to `n`, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1` or `middle`, `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1`, `truckCnt + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is not less than `truckCnt + 1`**
