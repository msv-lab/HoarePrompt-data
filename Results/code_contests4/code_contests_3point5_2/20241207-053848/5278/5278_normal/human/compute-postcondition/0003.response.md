According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
