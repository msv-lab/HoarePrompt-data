Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `num` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `num` is an input integer**
