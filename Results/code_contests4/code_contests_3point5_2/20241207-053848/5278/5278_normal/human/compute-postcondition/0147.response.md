Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers, `sumW` is the sum of all input integers, `w` contains all input integers, `i` is equal to n-1, `minP` is 0. If n == k, then `minP` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers. Otherwise, 'loadings' is the sum of all input integers, 'middle' is the value where 'truckCnt' plus 1 is equal to 'k', 'truckCnt' is the number of times 'middle < loadings' was true, 'n' remains the same, 'i' is equal to n, 'minP' is equal to the 'middle' value where 'truckCnt' plus 1 is equal to k, 'left' is assigned the value of 'middle' plus 1, 'right' is assigned the value of 'middle' minus 1.***
