Postcondition: ***'loadings' is the sum of all input integers, 'middle' remains the same, 'truckCnt' is the number of trucks needed to carry the load, 'n' remains the same, 'i' is equal to n, 'minP' is either equal to 'middle' if 'truckCnt' plus 1 is less than or equal to k, or 'middle - 1' if 'truckCnt' plus 1 is greater than k. Additionally, if 'truckCnt' plus 1 is less than or equal to k, 'left' is assigned the value of 'middle' plus 1, otherwise 'right' is assigned the value of 'middle - 1'.***
