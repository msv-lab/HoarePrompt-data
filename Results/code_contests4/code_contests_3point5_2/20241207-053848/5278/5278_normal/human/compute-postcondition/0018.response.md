Example Answer:
The value of `sumW` is increased by the input integer `num`. The original `sumW` value is unknown, but after this operation, `sumW` will be increased by `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the original `maxW` and the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the sum of the original `sumW` and the input integer `num`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the original `maxW` and the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the sum of the original `sumW` and the input integer `num`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending**
