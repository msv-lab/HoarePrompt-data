According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is equal to `n`. This means that the loop will not execute. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to decrement the value of `i` by 1.
State: **`loadings` is 0, `middle` is the average of `left` and `right`, `truckCnt` is 0, `n` remains the same, `i` is equal to n - 1, `minP` is either equal to `middle` if `truckCnt` plus 1 is less than or equal to k, or `middle - 1` if `truckCnt` plus 1 is greater than k, `left` is `middle + 1`, `right` is `middle - 1`**
