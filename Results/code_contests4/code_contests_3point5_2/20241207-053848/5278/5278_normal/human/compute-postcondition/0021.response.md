Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the original `maxW` and the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the sum of the original `sumW` and the input integer `num`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending. If `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` will be updated to `num` along with other mentioned changes.***
