Example Answer:
`loadings` is incremented by the value of `w[i]`, and then it is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The previous value of `loadings` is unknown, and the value of `i` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings` is incremented and assigned the value of `w[i]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`loadings` is incremented and assigned the value of `w[i]`, `middle` is less than `loadings`, `truckCnt` is less than `k + 1`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `i` is incremented by 1**
