Example Answer:
The variable `minP` is assigned the value of 0. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers, `sumW` is the sum of all input integers, `w` contains all input integers, `i` is equal to n-1, `minP` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers, `sumW` is the sum of all input integers, `w` contains all input integers, `i` is equal to n-1, `minP` is 0**
