Example Answer: 
The value of the variable `truckCnt` is not affected, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **variable `truckCnt` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
