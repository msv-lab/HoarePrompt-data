According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `n`, `i`, `minP`, `left`, `right` are updated according to the conditions specified. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, only `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than the current value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **all variables are updated according to the conditions specified, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than the current value of `i`**
