Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: 'loadings' is increased by the value of w[i], 'middle' and 'truckCnt' are unchanged, and the value of k is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: 'loadings' is increased by the value of w[i], 'middle' and 'truckCnt' remain the same, and if k is less than 'truckCnt' + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **'loadings' is increased by the value of w[i], 'middle' and 'truckCnt' remain the same, and if k is less than 'truckCnt' + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
