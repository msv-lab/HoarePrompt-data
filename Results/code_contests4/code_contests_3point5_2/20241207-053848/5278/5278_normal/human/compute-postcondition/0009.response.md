Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the input integer `num`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending, if `maxW` is less than `num`, then `maxW` is updated to `num`.***
