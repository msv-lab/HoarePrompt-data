Example Answer:
`minP` is assigned the value of `maxW`, which is equal to the maximum value of all input integers. The condition (1 == k) is false, so `minP` remains equal to `maxW`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is equal to k, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers, `sumW` is the sum of all input integers, `w` contains all input integers, `i` is equal to n-1, `minP` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers.
Output State: **n is equal to k, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers, `sumW` is the sum of all input integers, `w` contains all input integers, `i` is equal to n-1, `minP` is equal to the maximum value of all input integers**
