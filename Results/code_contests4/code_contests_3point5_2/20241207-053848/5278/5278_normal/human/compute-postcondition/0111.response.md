According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop won't execute initially. So, in order for the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Additionally, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle` or `middle - 1`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1` or `middle`, and `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1` or remain the same for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`loadings` is 0, `middle` is 0, `truckCnt` is 0, `n` remains the same, for the loop to execute the first time `i` needs to be less than `n`, `minP` is assigned the value of `middle` or `middle - 1`, `left` is assigned the value of `middle + 1` or `middle`, `right` is assigned the value of `middle - 1` or remain the same**
