Example Answer:
'middle' is calculated as the floor division of the sum of 'left' and 'right'. Given the initial state where 'left' is 'middle + 1' and 'right' is 'middle - 1', 'middle' will be the average of 'left' and 'right'. Therefore, the Output State is: 'loadings' is the sum of all input integers, 'middle' is the average of 'left' and 'right', 'truckCnt' is the number of trucks needed to carry the load, 'n' remains the same, 'i' is equal to n, 'minP' is either equal to 'middle' if 'truckCnt' plus 1 is less than or equal to k, or 'middle - 1' if 'truckCnt' plus 1 is greater than k, 'left' is 'middle + 1', 'right' is 'middle - 1'.
Output State: **'loadings' is the sum of all input integers, 'middle' is the average of 'left' and 'right', 'truckCnt' is the number of trucks needed to carry the load, 'n' remains the same, 'i' is equal to n, 'minP' is either equal to 'middle' if 'truckCnt' plus 1 is less than or equal to k, or 'middle - 1' if 'truckCnt' plus 1 is greater than k, 'left' is 'middle + 1', 'right' is 'middle - 1'**
