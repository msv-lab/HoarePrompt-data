Output State: After the loop executes, `loadings` will hold the sum of all elements in `w` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `middle` will remain the average of `left` and `right`, `truckCnt` will hold the number of times `middle < loadings` was true, `n` will remain the same, `i` will be equal to `n`, `minP` will remain the same, `left` will remain the same, `right` will remain the same. The loop will break when `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`.
