Example Answer:
`loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The value of `i` determines which element of list `w` is being assigned to `loadings`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `n`, `i`, `minP`, `left`, `right` are all affected as described. If `k` < `truckCnt + 1`, then the variables are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `n`, `i`, `minP`, `left`, `right` are all affected as described. If `k` < `truckCnt + 1`, then the variables are updated accordingly.**
