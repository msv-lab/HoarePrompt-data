Example Answer:
The value of `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`. The values of other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: truckCnt is increased by 1. If k is less than truckCnt + 1, truckCnt is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`.
Output State: **truckCnt is increased by 1. If k is less than truckCnt + 1, truckCnt is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`.**
