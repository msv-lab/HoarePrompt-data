According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` and `truckCnt` are increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`. Therefore, `loadings`, `middle`, and `truckCnt` should remain the same, and `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` and `truckCnt` are increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`**
