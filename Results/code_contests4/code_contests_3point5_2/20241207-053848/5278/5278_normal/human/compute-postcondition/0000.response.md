Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input string by space. The values of `n` and `k` are constrained by 1 <= n <= 100,000 and 1 <= k <= 100,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and 1 <= k <= 100,000.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and 1 <= k <= 100,000**
