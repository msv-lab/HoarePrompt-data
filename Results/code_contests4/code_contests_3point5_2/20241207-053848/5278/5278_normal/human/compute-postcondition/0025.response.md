Example Answer:
`minP` is assigned the value of `sumW`, where `sumW` is the sum of all input integers. Therefore, after execution, `minP` will be equal to the sum of all input integers. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, maxW is equal to the maximum value of all input integers, sumW is the sum of all input integers, w contains all input integers, i is equal to n-1, minP is equal to the sum of all input integers**
