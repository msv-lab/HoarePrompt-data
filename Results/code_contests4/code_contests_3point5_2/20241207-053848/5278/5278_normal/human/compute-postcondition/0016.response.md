According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the original `maxW` and the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the sum of the original `sumW` and the input integer `num`, `i` is 1, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` should still be less than `n`.
- Other variables such as `n`, `k`, `maxW`, `sumW`, and `w` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is equal to the maximum value between the original `maxW` and the input integer `num`, `sumW` is increased by the sum of the original `sumW` and the input integer `num`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `w` contains the input integer `num` after appending**
