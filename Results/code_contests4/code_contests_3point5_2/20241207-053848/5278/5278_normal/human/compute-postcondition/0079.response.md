Postcondition: ***`loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `n`, `minP`, `left`, `right`, `middle`, `k`, and `i` are integers. If k < truckCnt + 1, `loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` remains the average of `left` and `right`, `truckCnt` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `i` is equal to n - 1, `minP` remains the same, `left` remains the same, `right` remains the same, `middle` is less than `loadings`, and `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1. In the end, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
