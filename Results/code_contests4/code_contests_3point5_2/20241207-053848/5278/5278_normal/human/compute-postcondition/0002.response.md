Example Answer:
`maxW` and `sumW` are both initialized to 0. There are no changes to the values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100,000 and 1 <= k <= 100,000, `maxW` is 0, `sumW` is 0**
