Postcondition: After the execution of the if else block, the state of the variables will be as follows: `loadings` will hold the sum of all elements in `w` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `middle` will either be assigned the value of `minP` or `minP - 1`, `truckCnt` will hold the number of times `middle < loadings` was true, `n` will remain the same, `i` will be equal to `n`, `minP` will be assigned the value of `middle` or `middle - 1`, `left` will be assigned the value of `middle + 1` or `middle`, `right` will be assigned the value of `middle - 1` or remain the same. The loop will break when `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`.
