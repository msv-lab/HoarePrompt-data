Output State: **`loadings` is assigned the value of `w[i]`, `loadings`, `middle`, `truckCnt`, `n`, `i`, `w` are all integers. If `k` is less than `truckCnt + 1`, `loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` is increased by 1, and `truckCnt` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
