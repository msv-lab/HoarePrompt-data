Output State: **'loadings' is the sum of all input integers, 'middle' remains the same, 'truckCnt' is the number of trucks needed to carry the load, 'n' remains the same, 'i' is equal to n, 'minP' remains the same. If 'truckCnt' plus 1 is less than or equal to k, then 'minP' is assigned the value of 'middle'. Additionally, k is less than truckCnt + 1. 'left' is assigned the value of 'middle' plus 1.**
