Example Answer:
`truckCnt` is increased by 1. The previous value of `truckCnt` is unknown, so the output state is: `loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` is increased by 1, `truckCnt` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`.
Output State: **`loadings` is increased by the value of `w[i]`, `middle` is increased by 1, `truckCnt` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n+1`**
