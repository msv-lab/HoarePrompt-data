Functionality: **The function `func` reads input integers `n` and `k`. It then reads `n` more integers and calculates the sum `sumW`, the maximum value `maxW` among the inputs, and constructs a list `w` with the input integers. Based on specific conditions, it either updates the value of `minP` or performs a binary search algorithm to determine the value of `minP`. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
