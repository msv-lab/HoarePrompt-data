Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and `w_i`, calculates the minimum value of the maximum load `P` to load all packages from the belt conveyor, and then prints the minimum value of `P`. The program uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum value of `P` that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the minimum value of `P` is correctly calculated for any given input values of `n`, `k`, and `w_i`.
