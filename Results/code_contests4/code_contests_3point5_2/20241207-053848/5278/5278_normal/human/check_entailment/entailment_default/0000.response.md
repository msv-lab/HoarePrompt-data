Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integers `n` and `k` and then reads `n` more integers to calculate the sum `sumW`, the maximum value `maxW` among the inputs, and constructs a list `w` with the input integers.
- It correctly handles the special cases where `k` is 1 or `n` is equal to `k`.
- The binary search algorithm implemented in the code correctly determines the value of `minP` based on the conditions specified in the problem description.
- The code ensures that all packages from the belt conveyor are loaded onto the trucks while respecting the maximum load `P`.
