Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for $n$ and $k$, as well as the weights of the packages. It then iteratively determines the minimum value of the maximum load $P$ required to load all packages onto the trucks. The binary search algorithm implemented in the program efficiently finds the minimum value of $P$ by checking if the current load exceeds the maximum load and adjusting the search range accordingly. The program handles all potential cases where the weights of the packages on the conveyor belt need to be loaded onto the trucks while satisfying the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
