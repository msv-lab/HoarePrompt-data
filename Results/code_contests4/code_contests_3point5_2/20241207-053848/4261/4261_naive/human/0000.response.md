Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases, reads input properly, and prints the output as "YES" or "NO" based on whether the array v can be equal to the given array a after some steps. The program uses a set to keep track of the positions that need to be achieved in the array v, and it updates the set based on the values in the input array a. The logic for determining if the array v can be achieved after some steps is correctly implemented. Additionally, the program includes necessary input/output functions and FastIO implementation for efficient I/O processing. Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles the problem description as expected.
