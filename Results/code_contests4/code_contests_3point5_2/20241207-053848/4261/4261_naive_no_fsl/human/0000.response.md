Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem. It reads the input, processes each test case, and determines whether it is possible to achieve the desired array 'a' after some steps. The logic for checking the possibility is implemented in the `func_1` function. The program handles each test case separately and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the requirements. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
