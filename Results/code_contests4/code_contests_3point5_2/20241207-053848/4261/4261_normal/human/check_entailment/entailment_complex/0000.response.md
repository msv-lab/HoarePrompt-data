Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, where `func_1` handles the main algorithm logic and `func_2` is responsible for printing the output. The annotations provide insights into the state of the program before and after each function call, as well as the overall functionality of each function.

In `func_1`, it iterates over a list of integers, performs calculations on each element, and updates variables accordingly. The function checks if it is possible to make the array `v` equal to the given array `a` after some step based on the described algorithm. The function uses a set `req` to store unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations to determine if it's possible to achieve the target array `a`. The function correctly handles the cases where it is possible to achieve the target array and prints 'YES' accordingly.

In `func_2`, it prints the values to a stream or `sys.stdout` by default based on the input arguments. The function correctly handles printing the output 'YES' or 'NO' as required by the problem description.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations provide additional insights into the program's behavior. No specific case has been identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and provided examples.
