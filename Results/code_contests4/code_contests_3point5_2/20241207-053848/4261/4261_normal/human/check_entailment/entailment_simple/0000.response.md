Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes input for multiple test cases, processes each test case as described in the problem statement, and then outputs "YES" if it is possible to achieve the target array 'a' after some steps, and "NO" otherwise. The logic implemented in the program ensures that it correctly determines whether the target array can be achieved using the given algorithm.
