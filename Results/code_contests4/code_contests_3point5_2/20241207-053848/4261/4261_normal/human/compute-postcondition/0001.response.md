Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are extracted from the `kwargs` dictionary using the `pop` method. If `sep` is not present in `kwargs`, it is assigned the default value `' '`. If `file` is not present in `kwargs`, it is assigned the default value `sys.stdout`. The previous values of `sep` and `file` are unknown, so after execution, the output state is: `sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`**
