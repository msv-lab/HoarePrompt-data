According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` must be true. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `r` is in `req`, `req` contains `r`, and `i` is decreased by 1. To satisfy the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` need to be adjusted. Specifically, `j` needs to be increased, and `i` needs to be adjusted accordingly based on the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` needs to be increased, `i` needs to be adjusted based on the previous iteration for the loop to execute again**
