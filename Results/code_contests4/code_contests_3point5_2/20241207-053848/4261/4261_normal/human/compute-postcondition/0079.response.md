Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations along with the newly added value of `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the final value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, `i` % k, `i` is updated by floor division of itself by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is not in `req, `i` is decreased by 1.**
