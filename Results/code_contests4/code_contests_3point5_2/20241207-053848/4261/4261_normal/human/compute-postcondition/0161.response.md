According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. If the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is satisfied, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is equal to 0, `i` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition, `j` is 2, `req` contains 0, and `k` is a non-zero integer. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be modified to satisfy the loop condition based on the values of `j` and `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is equal to 0, `i` is modified to satisfy the loop condition, `j` is 2, `req` contains 0, `k` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute again**
