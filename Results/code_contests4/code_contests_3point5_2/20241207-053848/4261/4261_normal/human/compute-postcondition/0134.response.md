Example Answer:
The value of `j` is added to the set `req`, which contains unique values encountered during loop iterations. The final value of `j`, denoted by `r`, is assigned to `r`. After the loop completes, `j` is increased by `r`, and `j` is no longer in `req`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations including the final value of `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with the power of `k` raised to the power of `j`, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, all loop iterations have completed, `j` is increased by `r`, `j` is not in `req` after the loop completes.
