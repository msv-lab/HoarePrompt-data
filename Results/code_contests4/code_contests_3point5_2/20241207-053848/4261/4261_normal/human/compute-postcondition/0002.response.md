Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True**
