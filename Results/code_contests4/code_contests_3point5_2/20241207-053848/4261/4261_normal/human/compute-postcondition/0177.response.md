Functionality: **The function func_1 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a list of integers, performs certain calculations on each element, and updates variables accordingly. The function has multiple potential return cases based on different conditions, such as maintaining variables unchanged, updating and returning specific variables, performing calculations, and handling loops. The annotations provide insights into various return scenarios, but the actual code execution may not align with all the described cases. Therefore, the functionality includes iterating through the list, updating variables, and handling specific conditions, potentially with different return outcomes than described in the annotations.**
