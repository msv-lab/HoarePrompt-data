According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `args`. If there is at least one more element in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` represents the next element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list.
State: **`sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` represents the next element in the list, file writes the string representation of `x`.**
