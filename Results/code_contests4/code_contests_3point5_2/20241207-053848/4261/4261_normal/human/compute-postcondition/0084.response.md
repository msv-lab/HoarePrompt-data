According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i % k ** (j + 1)` should still be equal to 0, which means `i` should be divisible by `k` squared. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be divisible by `k` squared.
State: **`j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `i` should be divisible by `k` squared**
