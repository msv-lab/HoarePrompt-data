Example Answer:
The value of `i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `j` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is equal to 0, `i` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition, `j` is the maximum value where the loop condition is still true, `req` contains 0.
Output State: **`r` is equal to 0, `i` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition, `j` is the maximum value where the loop condition is still true, `req` contains 0**
