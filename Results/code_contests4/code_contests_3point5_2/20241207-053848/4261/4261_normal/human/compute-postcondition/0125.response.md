According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `j`, and the next element in `li`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations including the current `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j + 1`, `i` is greater than 0, and the next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Ensure that the next element in `li` can satisfy the loop condition.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations including the current `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j + 1`, `i` is greater than 0, and the next element in `li` satisfies the loop condition**.
