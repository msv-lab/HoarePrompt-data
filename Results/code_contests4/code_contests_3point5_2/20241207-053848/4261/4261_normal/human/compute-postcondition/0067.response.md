Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j` which is now incremented by 1, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered, `j` is incremented by 1**
