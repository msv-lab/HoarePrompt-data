Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and decremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and decremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is greater than 1**
