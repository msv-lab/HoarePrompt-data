According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `j`, and the elements in the list `li`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j` which is now incremented by 1, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered, `j` is incremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. Increment `j` by 1 to consider the next value.
2. Ensure that the next element in `li` is considered.
3. Update `j` to be the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`.
