Example Answer:
`i` is divided by k to the power of `j`. The value of `i` is dependent on the previous values of `i`, `k`, and `j`, but since those values are not provided, the output state will vary based on the specific values. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `i` is the result of `i // k ** j`, `j` is incremented by the maximum times the loop executed, `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `i` is the result of `i // k ** j`, `j` is incremented by the maximum times the loop executed, `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute**
