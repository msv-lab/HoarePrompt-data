Output State: **After the loop has executed, `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is 0, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, all loop iterations have completed**
