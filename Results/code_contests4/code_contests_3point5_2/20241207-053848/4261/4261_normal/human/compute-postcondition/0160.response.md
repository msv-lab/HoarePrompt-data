Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is equal to 0, `i` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition, `j` is 2, `req` contains 0, `k` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`r` is equal to 0, `i` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition, `j` is 2, `req` contains 0, `k` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute again**
