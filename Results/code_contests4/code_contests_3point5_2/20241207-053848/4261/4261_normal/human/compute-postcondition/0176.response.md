The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, there are multiple return cases based on different conditions:

Case 1: The variables n, k, li, req, r, i, j remain unchanged after the function call.

Case 2: The program does not explicitly return any value.

Case 3: The program returns the final value of the variable `j` after all iterations of the loop with the specified conditions.

Case 4: The program does not affect any variables or conditions and returns nothing.

Case 5: The program returns the updated value of 'j' after increasing it by 'r', where 'j' is in the set 'req'.

Case 6: The program returns the updated value of variable 'j' after being updated by 'r', where 'j' is in 'req'.

Case 7: The program does not explicitly return any value.

Case 8: The program returns the value of 'i' after performing integer division of 'i' by 'k'.

Case 9: The program returns the updated value of variable 'j' after it has been increased by 'r' and is included in 'req'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to have multiple return cases based on different conditions, including maintaining the variables unchanged, updating and returning specific variables, performing calculations, and handling loops.
