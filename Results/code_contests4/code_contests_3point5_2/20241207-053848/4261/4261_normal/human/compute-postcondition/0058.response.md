Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `r` is assigned the value of `j`, but the values of `r` and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is decreased by 1**
