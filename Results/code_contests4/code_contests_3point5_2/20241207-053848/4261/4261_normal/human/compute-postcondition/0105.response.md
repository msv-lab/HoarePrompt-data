Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` will have an increased value. The value of `i` is not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` has been increased by 1, `i` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`j` has been increased by 1, `i` remains unchanged**
