According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` is satisfied, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, the value of `j` is set to 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` and `k` must be such that `i % k ** (1) == 0` is true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The value of `j` is set to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i % k ** 1 == 0` is true**
