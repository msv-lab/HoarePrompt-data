Functionality: ** The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and iterates over elements in the `args` list, writing them to a specified `file` stream separated by the `sep` value. It then writes the value extracted from `kwargs` with the key 'end' or a newline character by default. If the key 'flush' is True in `kwargs`, the stream is flushed.**
