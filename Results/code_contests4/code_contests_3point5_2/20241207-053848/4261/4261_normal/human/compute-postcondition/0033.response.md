Output State: **`n` is assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `k` is assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains the added value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is modified by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is continuously increased by `r` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `i` is decremented by 1, `j` reaches a value where the loop condition is not met, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, and `i` has been decremented multiple times for the loop to stop executing.**
