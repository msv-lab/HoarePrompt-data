According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decreased by 1. So, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is assigned the value of `r`, `j` is in `req`, `req` contains `j`, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be greater than 1**
