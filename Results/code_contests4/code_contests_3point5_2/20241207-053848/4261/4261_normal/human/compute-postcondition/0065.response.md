Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are known as stated in the initial state. Since `j` is incremented by 1 and `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `r` will also be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j` which is now incremented by 1, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j` which is now incremented by 1, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered.**
