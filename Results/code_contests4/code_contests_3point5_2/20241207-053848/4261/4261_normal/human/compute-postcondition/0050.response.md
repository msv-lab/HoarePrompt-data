Output State: **`n` is assigned values returned by get_list(), `k` is assigned values returned by get_list(), `li` is assigned the list returned by get_list(), `req` contains the added value of the maximum `j` that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is decremented multiple times for the loop to stop executing, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, `i` is 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, `i` is decremented by the value of `k` raised to the power of `j`**
