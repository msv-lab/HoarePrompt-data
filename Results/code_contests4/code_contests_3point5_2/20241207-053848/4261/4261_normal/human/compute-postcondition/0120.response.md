Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is set to 0. Since the loop has completed all iterations and `j` should be the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, the value of `j` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, all loop iterations have completed.
