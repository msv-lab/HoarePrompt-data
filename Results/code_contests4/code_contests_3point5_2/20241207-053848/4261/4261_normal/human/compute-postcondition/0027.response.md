According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `li`, `req`, `r`, `i`, and `j` have specific initial values and modifications. To adjust the states for the loop to execute again, the following modifications need to be made:
- `n` is assigned values returned by `get_list()`
- `k` is assigned values returned by `get_list()`
- `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element
- `req` contains the added value of `j`
- `r` is assigned the value of `j`
- `i` is modified by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`
- `j` is increased by `r`
- `i` is decremented by 1
- `j` is incremented by 1
- `j` is further increased by 1

State: **`n` is assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `k` is assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains the added value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is modified by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is increased by `r`, `i` is decremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is further increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
