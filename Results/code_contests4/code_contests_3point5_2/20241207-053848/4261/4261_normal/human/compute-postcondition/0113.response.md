Example Answer:
`j` is added to the set `req`. The value of `j` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it remains unknown. The relationship between `j` and `r` is not directly specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is added to the set `req`.
Output State: **`j` is added to the set `req`**
