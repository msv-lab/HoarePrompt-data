According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `li`, the loop will iterate over each element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list `li` should be considered.
State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time**
