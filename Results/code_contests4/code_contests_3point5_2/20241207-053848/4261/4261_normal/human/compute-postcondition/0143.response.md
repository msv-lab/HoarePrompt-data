According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. This means that `i` must be divisible by `k ** (j + 1)` for the loop to continue. At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is 0, `i` has been decremented by 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `j` has been increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and decremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is greater than 1**
