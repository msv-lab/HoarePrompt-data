Example Answer:
`i` is updated by performing integer division by the value of `k` raised to the power of `j`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state after execution is: `j` is the maximum value such that `i % k` after updating `i` by performing integer division by `k` raised to the power of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is the maximum value such that `i % k` after updating `i` by performing integer division by `k` raised to the power of `j`**
