According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` is equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is 0, `r` is in `req`, `req` contains `r`, `i` is decreased by 1. Since the loop will not execute again, we need to adjust the states such that `i % k ** (j + 1)` is not equal to 0. 
State: **`j` is 0, `r` is in `req`, `req` contains `r`, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i % k ** (j + 1)` is not equal to 0**
