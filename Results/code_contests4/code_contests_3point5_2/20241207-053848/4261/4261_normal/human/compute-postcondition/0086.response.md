According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. The loop will execute again if `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1 or less because `(j + 1)` should be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`j` is 1 or less for the loop to execute again**
