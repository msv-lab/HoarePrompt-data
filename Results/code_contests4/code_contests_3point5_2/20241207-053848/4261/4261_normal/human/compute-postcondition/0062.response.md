According to the code, the loop condition is `i > 0`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `r` is 0**
