Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations including the final value of `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is updated by performing integer division with the power of `k` raised to the power of `j`, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, all loop iterations have completed, `j` is increased by `r`. Additionally, `j` is in `req` after entering the if condition.***
