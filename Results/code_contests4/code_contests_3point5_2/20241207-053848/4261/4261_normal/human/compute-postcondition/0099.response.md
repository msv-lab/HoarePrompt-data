Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is stated that `j` is assigned the value of `r`. Since `j` is in `req` and `req` contains `j`, it implies that `req` contains the value of `r`. The loop condition requires `i` to be greater than 1, and since `i` is decreased by 1, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `r` is in `req`, `req` contains `r`, `i` is decreased by 1, loop will not execute again.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `r` is in `req`, `req` contains `r`, `i` is decreased by 1, loop will not execute again**
