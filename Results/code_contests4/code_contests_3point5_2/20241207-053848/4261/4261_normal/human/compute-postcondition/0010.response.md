Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is extracted from `kwargs` or the default value ' '. The value of `file` is also extracted from `kwargs` or the default value `sys.stdout`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` represents the next element in the list.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` represents the next element in the list**
