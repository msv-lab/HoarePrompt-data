According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is equal to 0, `i` is -1, `j` is 1, `req` contains 0, and `k` is a non-zero integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value where `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is equal to 0, `i` is adjusted to satisfy the loop condition, `j` is 1, `req` contains 0, `k` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute again**
