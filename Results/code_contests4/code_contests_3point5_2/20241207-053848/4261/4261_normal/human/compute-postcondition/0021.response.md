Postcondition: ***`sep` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value ' ', `file` is assigned the value extracted from `kwargs` or default value `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` represents the last element in the list. If `at_start` is False, then the `sep` value is written to the `file` specified, and `x` is written to the `file`. The 'flush' key is removed from `kwargs` and its value is True.***
