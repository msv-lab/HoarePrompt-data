According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `j`, and the elements in the list `li`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are:
- `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`
- `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element
- `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations
- `r` is assigned the final value of `j` which is now incremented by 1
- `i` is greater than 0
- For the loop to execute the first time `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`
- Next element in `li` should be considered

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. `j` needs to be incremented by 1
2. The new value of `j` should be checked to ensure it is not in `req`
3. The next element in the list `li` should be considered for the loop condition
4. The conditions for `i`, `k`, and other variables need to be maintained as they are

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j` which is now incremented by 1, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered**
