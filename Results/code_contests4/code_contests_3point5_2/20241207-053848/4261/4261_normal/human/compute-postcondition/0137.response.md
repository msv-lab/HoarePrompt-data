According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is equal to `j` and `i` is decremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is equal to `j`, `i` is decremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is greater than 0**
