According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `j`, and `li`. 

Right before the loop, `i` is greater than 0, `k` and `n` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `r` is 0, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` must be satisfied. This means that `j` needs to be adjusted to the next element in `li` that is not in `req` and also satisfies the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 1 element, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, next element in `li` should be considered**
