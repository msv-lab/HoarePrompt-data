According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `j`, and the next element in `li`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations including the current `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `li` should be considered, so `li` should have more elements left to iterate. Additionally, the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` must still hold true. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
