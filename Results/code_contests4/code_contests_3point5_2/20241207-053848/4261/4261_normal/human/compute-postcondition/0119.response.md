According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, all loop iterations have completed**
