According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `r` is equal to 0, `i` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `i` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
