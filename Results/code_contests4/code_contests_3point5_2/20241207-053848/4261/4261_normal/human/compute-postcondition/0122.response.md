Example Answer: 
`j` is incremented by 1, which means it increases its value. Since the loop iterations have completed, the final value of `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations including the current `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, all loop iterations have completed.
