Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the value of `i`, so we cannot calculate the exact result. However, `j` was added to the set `req` and `r` was set equal to `j`, so these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is added to the set `req`, `r` is equal to `j`, and `i` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`j` is added to the set `req`, `r` is equal to `j`, and `i` is decremented by 1**
