Example Answer:

`j` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide information about the initial value of `j`, so after execution, `j` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `i` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`r` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `i` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is incremented by 1**
