Example Answer:
`i` is divided by `k` raised to the power of `j`, and the result is assigned back to `i`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are not provided, so the output state is: `j` is the maximum value such that `i % k`, `i` is updated after division by `k` raised to the power of `j`.
Output State: **`j` is the maximum value such that `i % k`, `i` is updated after division by `k` raised to the power of `j`**
