According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `j`. Right before the loop, `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, all loop iterations have completed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- The value of `j` should be increased to the next maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`.
- `j` should be added to `req` to keep track of unique values encountered during loop iterations.

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `get_list()`, `li` is assigned the list returned by `get_list()` with at least 2 elements, `req` contains all unique values of `j` encountered during the loop iterations including the current `j`, `r` is assigned the final value of `j`, `i` is greater than 0, next element in `li` should be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, all loop iterations have completed**
