According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `j`. If `i % k ** (j + 1)` equals 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is 0, `k` is not given. Since `k` is not given, we can assume it to be any non-zero integer for the loop to execute. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is equal to 0, `i` is -1, `j` is 0, `req` contains 0, `k` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute the first time**
