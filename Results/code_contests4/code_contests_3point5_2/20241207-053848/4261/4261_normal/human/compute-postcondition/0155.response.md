According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the result of `i // k` - 1. To ensure the loop executes again, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Output State: `r` is equal to `j`, `i` is the result of `i // k` - 1 and for the loop to execute again, `i` should be greater than 0, `j` is incremented by `r`, `j` is not in the list `req`, `req` now contains the value of `j`**
