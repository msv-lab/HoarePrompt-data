According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions are as follows: `n` is assigned values returned by get_list(), `k` is assigned values returned by get_list(), `li` is assigned the list returned by get_list() with at least 1 element, `req` contains the added value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is modified by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is continuously increased by `r` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `i` has been decremented multiple times for the loop to stop executing, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Increment `j` by 1 to `j` becomes 4.
- Decrement `i` by 1 to indicate it can be divisible by `k` raised to the power of `j + 1`.

State: **`n` is assigned values returned by get_list(), `k` is assigned values returned by get_list(), `li` is assigned the list returned by get_list() with at least 1 element, `req` contains the added value of `j`, `r` is assigned the value of `j`, `i` is modified by dividing it by `k` raised to the power of `j`, `j` is continuously increased by `r` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `i` has been decremented multiple times for the loop to stop executing, `j` is the maximum value that satisfies the loop condition and is not in `req`, `j` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 4**
