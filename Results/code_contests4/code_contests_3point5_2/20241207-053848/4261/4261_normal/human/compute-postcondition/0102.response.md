According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The condition `i % k ** (j + 1) == 0` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `i` is decreased by 1, and `r` is in `req`. To execute the loop one more time, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` need to be adjusted. Specifically, `i` needs to be such that `i % k ** (j + 2) == 0` and `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`j` is 2, `r` is in `req`, `req` contains `r`, `i` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute again `i % k ** 3 == 0`**
