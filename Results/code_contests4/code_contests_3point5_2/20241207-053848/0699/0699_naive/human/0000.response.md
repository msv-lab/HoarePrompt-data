Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum and maximum beauty of the array after performing operations. The program is missing the logic to handle the actual operations on the array to achieve the minimum and maximum beauty. The program only calculates the beauty based on the initial array values without considering the operations that can be performed on the array. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
