Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it is missing the necessary import statements for the `math` and `sys` modules. This will cause the program to throw a `NameError` when executed. Additionally, the `reduce` function is used without importing it from the `functools` module. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description and will not work for any input cases.
