Example Answer:
The code snippet prints two values formatted as integers, where the first value is `int(somme / x)` and the second value is `int(mx)`. The variables `somme` and `mx` are not defined in the initial state, so the output state will be based on the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a floating-point number, `mx` is the sum of math.ceil(a[i] / x) for each i in the range of n, `a` is a list of values, `n` is the length of the list `a`.
Output State: **`x` is a floating-point number, `mx` is the sum of math.ceil(a[i] / x) for each i in the range of n, `a` is a list of values, `n` is the length of the list `a`**
