Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code is missing the logic to actually perform the operations on the array to find the minimum and maximum beauty. The function `func_1` only calculates the sum of values in the list `a` and does some other calculations, but it does not actually manipulate the array as required in the problem description. The output hints also do not mention anything about the actual manipulation of the array elements to find the beauty. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
