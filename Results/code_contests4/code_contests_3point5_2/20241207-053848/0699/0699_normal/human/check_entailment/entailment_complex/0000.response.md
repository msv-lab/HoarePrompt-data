Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum and maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description. The program calculates the maximum beauty correctly by summing up the ceil of each element divided by x. However, it incorrectly calculates the minimum beauty by dividing the sum of the array by x, which is not the correct approach.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly calculate the minimum beauty as well. This can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order, and then iteratively summing up pairs of elements and taking the ceil of the sum divided by x until only one element is left. The sum of the ceil values obtained in this process represents the minimum beauty.
