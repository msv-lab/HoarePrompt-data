Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function that calculates the minimum and maximum possible beauty of an array based on the given problem description. The function correctly calculates the sum of the array elements divided by x to get the minimum beauty, and sums up the ceiling values of each element divided by x to get the maximum beauty. The function then prints the minimum and maximum beauty values for each test case.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the beauty of the array based on the provided formula and performs the required operations on the array to find the minimum and maximum beauty values. It handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description and outputs the correct results.
