Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads the number of test cases, the length of the password, and the initial contents of the password. It then iterates through each test case, checks if there are adjacent numbers that are not equal, and if so, prints 1. If all numbers are equal, it prints the length of the password. This logic follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
