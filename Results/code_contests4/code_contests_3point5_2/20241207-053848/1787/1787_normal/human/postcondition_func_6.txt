The function func_7 accepts two parameters, x and y. It then performs the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of x and y. The function returns the final value of x after the loop terminates when y becomes 0. If x and y are initially 0, the function will return 0. If y is 0 initially, the function will return the absolute value of x.
