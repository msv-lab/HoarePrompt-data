Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, `flag` are integers resulting from `func_6()` and `func_5()` respectively. The result of `func_6()` is truthy, `Arr` has more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the next element in `Arr` after the current iteration, and `flag` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then the program remains the same but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
