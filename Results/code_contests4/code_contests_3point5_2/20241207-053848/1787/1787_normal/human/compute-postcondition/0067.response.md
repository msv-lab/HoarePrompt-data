Output State: **`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the next element after the current `i`, `flag` is 1, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`, for the loop to execute `Arr` has more than 2 elements. If `i` is not equal to `p`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
