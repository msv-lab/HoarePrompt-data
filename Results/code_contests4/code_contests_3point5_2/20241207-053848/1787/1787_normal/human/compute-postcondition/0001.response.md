According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `T` is considered truthy. Right before the loop, `T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()`. So in order for the loop to execute one more time, the result of `func_6()` should yield a truthy value, meaning not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **T is an integer resulting from the function func_6() and the result of func_6() is truthy (not equal to 0) for the loop to execute the first time**
