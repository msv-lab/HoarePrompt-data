According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `Arr`, specifically if there are elements other than the first element. Since `Arr[1:]` implies all elements of `Arr` except the first one, the loop will execute if `Arr` has more than one element. 

State: **`T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `n` is an integer obtained from `func_6()`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()` with more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 0**
