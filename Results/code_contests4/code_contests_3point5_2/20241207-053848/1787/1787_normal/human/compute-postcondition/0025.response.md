Output State: **`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, `flag` are integers resulting from `func_6()` and `func_5()`. The result of `func_6()` is truthy. `Arr` has more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, and `flag` is either 0 or a non-1 integer. If all elements in `Arr` are equal, the loop will finish without changing the value of `flag`, which will remain as 0. The code snippet simply prints the value of `n` without affecting any other variables. `T` is decremented by 1.**
