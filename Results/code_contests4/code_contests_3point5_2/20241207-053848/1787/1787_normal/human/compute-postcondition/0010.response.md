Postcondition: ***`T`, `n` are integers resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy. `Arr` is the result of `func_5()` with more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `p`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
