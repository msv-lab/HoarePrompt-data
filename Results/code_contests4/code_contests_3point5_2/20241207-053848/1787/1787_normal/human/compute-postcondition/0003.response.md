Example Answer:
`Arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`. The values of `T` and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `n` is an integer obtained from `func_6()`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()`.
Output State: **`T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `n` is an integer obtained from `func_6()`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()`**
