Postcondition: ***`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is either 1 if there is a mismatch between elements, or 0 if all elements are the same, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`. If flag is 1, the program handles a mismatch between elements. If flag is not equal to 1, indicating no mismatch, the value of `n` is printed.***
