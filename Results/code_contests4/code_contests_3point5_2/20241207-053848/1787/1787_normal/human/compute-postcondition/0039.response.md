Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time the last element `i` in `Arr` is not equal to the first element `p`. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
