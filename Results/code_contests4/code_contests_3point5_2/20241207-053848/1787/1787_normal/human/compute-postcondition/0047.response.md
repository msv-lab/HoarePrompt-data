Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1. The loop will set flag to 1 if any element in Arr from the second element onwards is not equal to the first element `p`. The condition (flag == 1) is false, meaning all elements in Arr from the second element onwards are equal to the first element `p`***
