Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the first element of the list `Arr`, so `p` is equal to `Arr[0]`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `Arr` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `n` is an integer obtained from `func_6()`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`.
Output State: **`T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `n` is an integer obtained from `func_6()`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`**
