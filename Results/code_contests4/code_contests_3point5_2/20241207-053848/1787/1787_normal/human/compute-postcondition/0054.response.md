Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of the first element of `Arr`. The previous values of the variables are known as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` is assigned the result of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute again `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`.
Output State: **`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` is assigned the result of `func_5()`, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute again `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`**
