According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `Arr` after the current element `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, `flag` are integers resulting from `func_6()` and `func_5()`, the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `Arr` has more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the next element in `Arr` after the current iteration, and `flag` is 1. Since the loop is iterating over `Arr[1:]`, the next element `i` should be the one after the current element in `Arr`.

State: **`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, `flag` are integers resulting from `func_6()` and `func_5()`, the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `Arr` has more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the element after the current element in `Arr`, and `flag` is 1**.
