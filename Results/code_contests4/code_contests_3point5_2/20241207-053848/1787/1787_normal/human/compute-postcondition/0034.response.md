Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` is assigned the result of func_5(), `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute `Arr` has more than one element. The last element `i` in `Arr` is not equal to the first element `p`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
