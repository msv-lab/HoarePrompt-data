Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_6()` after converting it to an integer. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute again `T` is greater than 0, and `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`.
Output State: **`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute again `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`**
