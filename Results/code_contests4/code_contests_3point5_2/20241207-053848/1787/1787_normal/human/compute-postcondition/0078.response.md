Functionality: **The function `func_12()` does not accept any parameters and iterates a loop `T` number of times. It retrieves an integer `n`, an array `Arr`, and the first element `p` from functions `func_6()` and `func_5()` respectively. It then checks if all elements in `Arr` are the same, setting `flag` accordingly. If `flag` is 1, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints the value of `n`. After each iteration, the loop decrements `T`. The function does not have explicit return values and prints specific outputs based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop.**
