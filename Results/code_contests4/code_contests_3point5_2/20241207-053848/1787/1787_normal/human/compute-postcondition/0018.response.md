Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, `flag` are integers resulting from `func_6()` and `func_5()`. The result of `func_6()` is truthy. `Arr` has more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the element after the current element in `Arr`, and `flag` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then `T`, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, `flag` remain unchanged, and `flag` stays as 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
