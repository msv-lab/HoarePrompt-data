Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(func_6())`, where the result of `func_6()` is an integer that is converted to another integer. Since it is stated that the result of `func_6()` is truthy (not equal to 0) for the loop to execute the first time, we can safely assume that `n` will have a non-zero integer value after running the function. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy (not equal to 0) for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is an integer obtained from `func_6()`**
