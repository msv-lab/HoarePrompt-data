Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1. If flag is equal to 1, it means that at least one element in Arr from the second element onwards is not equal to `p`, and the code prints 1. If flag is not equal to 1, it indicates that all elements in Arr from the second element onwards are equal to `p`, and `n` will be printed.***
