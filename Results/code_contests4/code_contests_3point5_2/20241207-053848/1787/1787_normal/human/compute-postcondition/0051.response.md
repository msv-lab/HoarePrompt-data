According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `T` is a truthy value. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is decremented by 1, indicating that the value of `T` was initially greater than the current value. Therefore, to execute the loop again, `T` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute again `T` is greater than 0**
