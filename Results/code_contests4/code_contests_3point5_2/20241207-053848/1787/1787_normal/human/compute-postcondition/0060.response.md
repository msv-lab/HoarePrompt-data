Postcondition: ***`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`, for the loop to execute `Arr` has more than 1 element. If `i` is not equal to `p`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
