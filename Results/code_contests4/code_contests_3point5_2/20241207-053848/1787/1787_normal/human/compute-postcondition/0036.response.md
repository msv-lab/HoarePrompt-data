According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `Arr`. If `Arr` has more than one element and the last element `i` is not equal to the first element `p`, then the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0, `Arr` is assigned the result of func_5(), `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, and `flag` is 1. Since the loop is iterating over elements in `Arr[1:]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `Arr` must have at least 3 elements and `i` should not be equal to `p` for the next element in `Arr`. Additionally, `flag` remains 1.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time the last element `i` in `Arr` is not equal to the first element `p`**
