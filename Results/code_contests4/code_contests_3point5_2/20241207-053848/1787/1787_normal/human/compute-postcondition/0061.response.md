According to the code, the loop will iterate over elements in `Arr` starting from the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` still has at least 2 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `Arr` has more than 1 element. Since `i` is the last element in `Arr`, the loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in `Arr` after `i`.

State: **`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the second to last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`, for the loop to execute `Arr` has more than 2 elements**.
