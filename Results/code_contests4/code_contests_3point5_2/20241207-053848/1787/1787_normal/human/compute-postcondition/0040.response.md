According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the last element `i` in `Arr` is not equal to the first element `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the last element `i` in `Arr` should not be equal to the first element `p` after the loop body is executed.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `i` is not equal to `p` at the start of the next iteration**
