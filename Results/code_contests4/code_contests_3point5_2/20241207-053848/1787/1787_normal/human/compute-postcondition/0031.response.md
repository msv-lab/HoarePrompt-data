According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Arr` and `i`. If Arr has more than one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 0, `Arr` must be assigned the result of func_5(), `p` must be the first element of `Arr`, and `i` must be the last element in `Arr`. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` is assigned the result of func_5(), `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 0, for the loop to execute `Arr` has more than one element**
