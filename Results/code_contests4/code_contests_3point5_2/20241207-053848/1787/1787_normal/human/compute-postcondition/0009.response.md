Output State: **`T` is an integer resulting from the function `func_6()` and the result of `func_6()` is truthy, `n` is an integer obtained from `func_6()`, `Arr` is the result of `func_5()` with more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `flag` is 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `p` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
