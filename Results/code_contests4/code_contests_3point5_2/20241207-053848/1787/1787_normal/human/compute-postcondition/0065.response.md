According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in `Arr` after the first element. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the second to last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `Arr` must have more than 2 elements, and the current `i` should be different from `p` in order to not break out of the loop. The next iteration should have `i` as the next element in `Arr` after the current `i`.

State: **`T` is decremented by 1, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the next element after the current `i`, `flag` is 1, `n` is the integer value returned by `func_6()`, for the loop to execute `Arr` has more than 2 elements. If `i` is not equal to `p`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
