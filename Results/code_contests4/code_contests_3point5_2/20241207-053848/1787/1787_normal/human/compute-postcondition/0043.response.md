Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `Arr` has at least 3 elements, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, `flag` is 1, `i` is not equal to `p` at the start of the next iteration. If `i` is not equal to `p`, then `flag` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
