According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `T` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is decremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `T` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`T` is an integer resulting from func_6() and func_5(), `n` is an integer resulting from func_5(), `Arr` has more than one element, `p` is the first element of `Arr`, `i` is the last element in `Arr`, and `flag` is either 0 or a non-1 integer, for the loop to execute again `T` is greater than 0**
