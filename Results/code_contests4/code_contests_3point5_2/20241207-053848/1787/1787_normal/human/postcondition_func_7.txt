The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x`, a list of positive integers with length n, and `y`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. It then calculates the result by multiplying the list of positive integers `x` by the positive integer `y` and dividing the outcome by the value returned by the function `func_7(x, y)`. The function performs this computation and returns the final result. However, there is a potential edge case if `func_7(x, y)` returns 0, resulting in a division by zero error. This case is not handled in the current implementation.
