You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!

A password is an array a of n positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index i such that 1 ≤ i < n and a_{i} ≠ a_{i+1}, delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array and put a_{i}+a_{i+1} in their place. 

For example, for array [7, 4, 3, 7] you can choose i = 2 and the array will become [7, 4+3, 7] = [7, 7, 7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.

Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 1. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 0) of operations?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the password.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the initial contents of your password.

The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Example

Input


2
4
2 1 3 1
2
420 420


Output


1
2

Note

In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of 1:

Pick i=2 to get [2, 4, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [6, 1]

Pick i=1 to get [7]

In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid i that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    fact = [1]
    for i in range(1, 100005):
        fact.append(fact[-1] * i % mod)
    ifact = [0] * 100005
    ifact[100004] = pow(fact[100004], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(100004, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function `func_1` calculates and returns two lists: `fact` containing factorials modulo `mod` from 1 to 100004, and `ifact` containing 100005 elements updated based on a specific formula. The function correctly computes the factorials and their modulo values as described in the annotations.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the password, and `p` is a list of `n` positive integers representing the initial contents of the password. The function then calculates and returns the result of raising `n` to the power of `p-2` modulo `p`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod
    return t
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates the value of 't' based on the provided formulas involving the elements of `fact`, `ifact`, and `mod`. The specific value of 't' returned by the function cannot be determined with the given initial state.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_4` reads input from the standard input, converts the input into integers using the `map` function, and returns a map object containing these integers. The code does what the annotations describe, converting input to integers and returning a map object.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` reads input from the standard input, maps the input values to integers, splits them, and returns a list of integers.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input (stdin) and returns a string obtained by stripping the input read from sys.stdin. The input consists of a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers `a_i`. The function processes the input and returns a string obtained by stripping the input read from sys.stdin.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function func_7 accepts two parameters, x and y. It then performs the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of x and y. The function returns the final value of x after the loop terminates when y becomes 0. If x and y are initially 0, the function will return 0. If y is 0 initially, the function will return the absolute value of x.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x`, a list of positive integers with length n, and `y`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. It then calculates the result by multiplying the list of positive integers `x` by the positive integer `y` and dividing the outcome by the value returned by the function `func_7(x, y)`. The function performs this computation and returns the final result. However, there is a potential edge case if `func_7(x, y)` returns 0, resulting in a division by zero error. This case is not handled in the current implementation.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of the password and an array `a` containing `n` positive integers. It returns `n` if `n % 4` is 0, 1 if `n % 4` is 1, `n + 1` if `n % 4` is 2, and 0 if `n % 4` is 3. The function directly returns one of these values based on the result of the modulo operation.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b:
        if b & 1:
            res = res * a
            res %= MOD
            b -= 1
        else:
            a = a * a
            a %= MOD
            b >>= 1
    res %= MOD
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers. It calculates the result of `a` raised to the power of `b` modulo `MOD` using a bitwise operation loop. The function returns the final result stored in the variable `res`. If `b` is 0 initially, the function returns 1.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(P):
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2
    return ans
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts a parameter P, calculates the value of 'ans' based on the formula (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2, and returns the result. It is important to note that the code snippet is missing the import statement for the sqrt function, which could lead to a NameError. Additionally, there could be a potential division by zero error if the denominator becomes zero during the calculation of 'ans'.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    T = int(func_6())
    while T:
        n = int(func_6())
        Arr = func_5()
        p = Arr[0]
        flag = 0
        for i in Arr[1:]:
            if i != p:
                flag = 1
                break
        if flag == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        T -= 1

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
