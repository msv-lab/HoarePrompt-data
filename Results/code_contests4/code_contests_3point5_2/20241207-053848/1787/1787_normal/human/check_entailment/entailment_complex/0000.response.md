Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code, all the functions seem to be correctly implemented according to their annotations. The main function `func_12()` reads the input, checks if all elements in the password array are the same, and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program correctly handles the described operations on the password array and provides the expected output for each test case. Additionally, the annotations do not suggest any potential cases where the code might fail to follow the problem description. Hence, the code is deemed correct.
