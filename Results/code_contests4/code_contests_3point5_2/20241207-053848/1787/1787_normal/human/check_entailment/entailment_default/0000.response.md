Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
Upon analyzing the code and the problem description, along with the output hints, there is a potential issue in the `func_12()` function. The function checks if all elements in the array `Arr` are the same and if so, it prints `1`, otherwise, it prints the length of the password `n`. However, the code does not consider the case where the adjacent numbers are equal and hence cannot be replaced by their sum. This means that the code may not handle the scenario where the operation described in the problem cannot be applied due to the initial configuration of the password. Therefore, the program does not fully comply with the problem description for every potential case.
