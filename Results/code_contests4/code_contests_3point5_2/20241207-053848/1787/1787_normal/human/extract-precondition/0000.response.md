**Precondition:**

- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) is provided, representing the length of the password.
  - n integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) are given, representing the initial contents of the password.
- The sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
