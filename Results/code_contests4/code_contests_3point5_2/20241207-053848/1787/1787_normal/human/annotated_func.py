    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `fact` is a list containing the factorials modulo mod from 1 to 100004, `i` is 0, `ifact` is a list of 100005 elements all updated based on the formula mentioned above
    return fact, ifact
    #The program returns the list `fact` containing factorials modulo `mod` from 1 to 100004 and the list `ifact` containing 100005 elements updated based on the formula mentioned above
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns two lists: `fact` containing factorials modulo `mod` from 1 to 100004, and `ifact` containing 100005 elements updated based on a specific formula. The function correctly computes the factorials and their modulo values as described in the annotations.

def func_2(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of raising n to the power of p-2 modulo p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the password, and `p` is a list of `n` positive integers representing the initial contents of the password. The function then calculates and returns the result of raising `n` to the power of `p-2` modulo `p`.

    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod
    return t
    #The program returns the value of 't', which cannot be determined with the provided initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates the value of 't' based on the provided formulas involving the elements of `fact`, `ifact`, and `mod`. The specific value of 't' returned by the function cannot be determined with the given initial state.

def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from the input read from the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input from the standard input, converts the input into integers using the `map` function, and returns a map object containing these integers. The code does what the annotations describe, converting input to integers and returning a map object.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers after mapping the input values from standard input and splitting them
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads input from the standard input, maps the input values to integers, splits them, and returns a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each a_i is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9.**
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string obtained by stripping the input read from sys.stdin
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input (stdin) and returns a string obtained by stripping the input read from sys.stdin. The input consists of a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` followed by `n` positive integers `a_i`. The function processes the input and returns a string obtained by stripping the input read from sys.stdin.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer representing the length of the password. a is a list of n positive integers representing the initial contents of the password. Each element in a is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9.**
def func_7(x, y):

        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x and y are updated accordingly, the loop will terminate when y becomes 0
    return x
    #The program returns the final value of x after the loop terminates when y becomes 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts two parameters, x and y. It then performs the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of x and y. The function returns the final value of x after the loop terminates when y becomes 0. If x and y are initially 0, the function will return 0. If y is 0 initially, the function will return the absolute value of x.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of positive integers with length n, and y is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of multiplying the list of positive integers x by the positive integer y and then dividing the result by the value returned by the function func_7(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x`, a list of positive integers with length n, and `y`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. It then calculates the result by multiplying the list of positive integers `x` by the positive integer `y` and dividing the outcome by the value returned by the function `func_7(x, y)`. The function performs this computation and returns the final result. However, there is a potential edge case if `func_7(x, y)` returns 0, resulting in a division by zero error. This case is not handled in the current implementation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the password and the array a contains n positive integers.**
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
    #The program returns one of the following based on the value of n: n if n%4 is 0, 1 if n%4 is 1, n+1 if n%4 is 2, and 0 if n%4 is 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of the password and an array `a` containing `n` positive integers. It returns `n` if `n % 4` is 0, 1 if `n % 4` is 1, `n + 1` if `n % 4` is 2, and 0 if `n % 4` is 3. The function directly returns one of these values based on the result of the modulo operation.

def func_10(a, b):
    res = 1
    while b:
        if b & 1:
            res = res * a
            res %= MOD
            b -= 1
        else:
            a = a * a
            a %= MOD
            b >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res` is an integer, `b` is 0. If `b` was initially non-zero, `res` is the result of `a` raised to the power of the initial `b` value modulo `MOD`. If `b` was initially 0, `res` remains 1.
    res %= MOD
    return res
    #The program returns the updated value of 'res' based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers. It calculates the result of `a` raised to the power of `b` modulo `MOD` using a bitwise operation loop. The function returns the final result stored in the variable `res`. If `b` is 0 initially, the function returns 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_11(P):
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of 'ans' calculated based on the formula (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2, where the value of 'P' is unknown
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter P, calculates the value of 'ans' based on the formula (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2, and returns the result. It is important to note that the code snippet is missing the import statement for the sqrt function, which could lead to a NameError. Additionally, there could be a potential division by zero error if the denominator becomes zero during the calculation of 'ans'.

        if flag == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
        T -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `T` is 0, `n`, `Arr`, `p`, `i`, `flag` are integers resulting from `func_6()` and `func_5()`. The loop has finished executing, and all elements in `Arr` are the same, resulting in `flag` being 0. The loop printed the value of `n` after each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12()` does not accept any parameters and iterates a loop `T` number of times. It retrieves an integer `n`, an array `Arr`, and the first element `p` from functions `func_6()` and `func_5()` respectively. It then checks if all elements in `Arr` are the same, setting `flag` accordingly. If `flag` is 1, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints the value of `n`. After each iteration, the loop decrements `T`. The function does not have explicit return values and prints specific outputs based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop.
