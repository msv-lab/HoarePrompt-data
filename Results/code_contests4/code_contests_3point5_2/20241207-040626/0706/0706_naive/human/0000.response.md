Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers in the given range [li, ri] and outputs the sum as required by the problem description. The program uses the concept of prime number sieve to efficiently calculate the prime numbers and their counts up to a given range. The program then calculates the sum of prime numbers in the given range for each query and outputs the result. The logic seems correct and the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
