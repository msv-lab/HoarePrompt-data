Correctness: **True**

The program calculates the number of prime numbers in the given range [li, ri] by precomputing the count of numbers divisible by each prime number up to the maximum number in the input sequence. It then answers each query by subtracting the count of primes less than l from the count of primes less than or equal to r.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly handles the input constraints and computes the prime count efficiently using precomputation. Each query is answered correctly by calculating the difference in prime counts for the given range. Therefore, the program is correct.
