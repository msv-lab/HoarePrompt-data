Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input correctly using the provided functions `func_1` and `func_3`.
- The program then calculates the number of integers in the given sequence that are divisible by each prime number in the range [2, N].
- It uses prefix sum technique to efficiently calculate the total count of integers divisible by prime numbers up to a certain index.
- Finally, it correctly calculates and prints the sum of the counts of integers divisible by prime numbers within the given query range [l, r].

The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples. There are no edge cases identified where the program does not behave as expected. Hence, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
