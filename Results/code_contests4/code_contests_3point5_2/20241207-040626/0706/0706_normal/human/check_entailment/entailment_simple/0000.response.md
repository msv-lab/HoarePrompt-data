Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The provided annotated program does not include any function that actually solves the described problem. The functions defined in the program are simply reading input and printing output without performing the required calculations.

2. The functions do not calculate the number of indexes k such that xk is divisible by a prime number in the given range [li, ri].

3. Without a function that solves the main problem described in the prompt, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
