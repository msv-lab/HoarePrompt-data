According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `li` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `li` is a list with at least 2 elements and the element at index `i` is printed. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than the length of the list `li`.
State: **`li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i+1` is printed for the loop to execute another time**
