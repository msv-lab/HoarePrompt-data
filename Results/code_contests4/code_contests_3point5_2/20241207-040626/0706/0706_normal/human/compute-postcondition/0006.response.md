Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the element at index `i` of the list `li` and uses `stdout.write()` to print it without a newline character. After execution, the same element will be printed again in the loop for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i` is printed for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i` is printed for the loop to execute another time**
