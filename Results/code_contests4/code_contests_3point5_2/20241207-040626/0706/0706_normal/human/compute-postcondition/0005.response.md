According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the index `i` is less than the length of the list `li` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `li` contains at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i` is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i+1` is printed for the loop to execute another time**
