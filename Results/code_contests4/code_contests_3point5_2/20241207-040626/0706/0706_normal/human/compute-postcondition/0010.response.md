Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the last element of the list `li` using the `stdout.write()` function. The values of the elements in `li` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and all elements in `li` except the last one are printed.
Output State: **`li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and all elements in `li` except the last one are printed**
