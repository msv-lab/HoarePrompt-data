According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of the list `li` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `li` is not empty, it means it has at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `li` must have at least 2 elements. Before the loop starts, `li` is a list and not empty, so the state needs to be adjusted to `li` has at least 2 elements.
State: **`li` is a list with at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute the first time**
