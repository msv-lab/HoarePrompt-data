Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints the element at index `i` of the list `li` using the `stdout.write` function. The initial state indicates that `li` is a list with at least 2 elements, so the code will execute successfully with the first element being printed. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact element that will be printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i` is printed.
Output State: **`li` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i` is printed**
