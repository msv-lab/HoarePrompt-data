The function reads an integer `n` from input, followed by an array of integers `a`. It then calculates the frequency of each integer in `a` and uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum based on the frequencies and values of integers. Finally, it outputs the maximum sum calculated. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
