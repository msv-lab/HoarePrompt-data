Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function, `olws` is a lambda function, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an integer value, `freq` is a list representing the frequency of integer values in `a`, `i` is 4, `dp` is a list containing 0 as the first element, the frequency of the integer value 2 in `a` as the second element, the maximum value between the last two elements of `dp` appended with the product of the frequency of 2 and 2, and finally `dp` is updated by appending the maximum value between the last two elements of `dp` and the sum of the product of the frequency of 2 and 2 with the second last element of `dp`.**
