According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the input integer `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `n` should be greater than 0
2. `i` should be initialized to 0

State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of the input after applying the `int` function, `freq` is a list initialized with 100001 zeros, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute**
