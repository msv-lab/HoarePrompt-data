Example Answer:
The lambda function `ol` takes an array as input, converts each element to a string, joins them with a space in between, and then writes the result to the standard output followed by a newline character. The initial state variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces**
