Example Answer:
The lambda function `os` is defined to take an input `i`, convert it to a string, add a newline character, and then write it to the standard output. The initial state variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces.
Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces**
