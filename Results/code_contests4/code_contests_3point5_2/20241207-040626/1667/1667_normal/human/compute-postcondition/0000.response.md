Example Answer: 
`ti` is assigned a lambda function that reads input from `stdin` and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces. The initial state does not provide information about `stdin`, so the output state is simply: `ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces.
Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces**.
