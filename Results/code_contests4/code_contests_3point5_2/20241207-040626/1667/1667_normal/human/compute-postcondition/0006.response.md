Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the result of applying the `ma` function to the `int` function and the result of `ti()`. Since `n` is an input integer, `ti()` will read an integer input. The `ma` function will then apply the `int` function to this input integer, converting it to an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the integer value of the input after applying the `int` function.
Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the integer value of the input after applying the `int` function**
