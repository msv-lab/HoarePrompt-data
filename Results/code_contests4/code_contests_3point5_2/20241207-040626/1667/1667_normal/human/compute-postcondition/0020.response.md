According to the code, the loop can execute again depending on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3. As the loop increases `i` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 3. 
State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is the integer value of the input after applying the `int` function, `freq` is a list where each element represents the frequency of a corresponding integer value in the input array `a`, `i` is 4, `dp` is a list containing 0 as the first element, the frequency of the integer value 2 in the input array as the second element, and the maximum value between the last two elements of `dp` appended with the product of the frequency of 2 and 2, and finally `dp` is updated by appending the maximum value between the last two elements of `dp` and the sum of the product of the frequency of 2 and 2 with the second last element of `dp`, for the loop to execute a fourth time `n` must be greater than 4**
