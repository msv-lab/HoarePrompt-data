Example Answer:
`ma` is assigned a lambda function that takes two arguments, `fxn` and `ti`, and applies `fxn` to each element of `ti` after splitting it. The initial state does not change, so the Output State is: `ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces.
Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces**
