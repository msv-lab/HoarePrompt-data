According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of the input after applying the `int` function, `freq` is a list where the element at index `a[i]` has been incremented by 2, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of the input after applying the `int` function, `freq` is a list where the element at index `a[i]` has been incremented by 2, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
