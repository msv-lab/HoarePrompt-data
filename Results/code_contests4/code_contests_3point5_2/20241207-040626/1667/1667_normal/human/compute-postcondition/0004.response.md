Example Answer:
The lambda function `olws` takes an array as input, converts each element to a string, joins them together, and then writes the result to the standard output with a newline character. The initial state is `ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces. 
Output State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character**
