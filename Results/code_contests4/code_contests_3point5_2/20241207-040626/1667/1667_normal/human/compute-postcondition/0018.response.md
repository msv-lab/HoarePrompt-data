According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 3. Also, since `i` is used in the loop condition, it should be less than or equal to `n`, so `n` should be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`ti` is a lambda function that reads input and strips whitespaces, `olws` is a lambda function that writes the elements of an array to the standard output with a newline character, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is the integer value of the input after applying the `int` function, `freq` is a list where each element represents the frequency of a corresponding integer value in the input array `a`, `i` is 3, `dp` is a list containing 0 as the first element, the frequency of the integer value 2 in the input array as the second element, and the maximum value between the last two elements of `dp` appended with the product of the frequency of 2 and 2.**
