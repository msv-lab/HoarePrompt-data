Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from input, followed by an array of integers `a`.
- It calculates the frequency of each integer in `a`.
- It then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum based on the frequencies and values of integers.
- Finally, it outputs the maximum sum calculated.

The code appears to correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct. The dynamic programming approach efficiently calculates the maximum points Alex can earn by strategically choosing elements to delete from the sequence.
