Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. It reads the input sequence, calculates the frequencies of each integer, and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum based on the frequencies and values of integers. Finally, it outputs the maximum sum calculated. The program follows the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
