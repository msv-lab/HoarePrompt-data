Correctness: **False**

The given program has issues with the implementation of the `func_2` function. The function is trying to match the occurrences of string `s` in string `t` by using a pattern matching algorithm, but the implementation is incorrect. It is not handling all the cases correctly as per the problem description.

For example, if we consider the input:
```
5 3
3-a 2-b 4-c 3-a 2-c
2-a 2-b 1-c
```
The expected output should be `1`, but the program will not produce the correct result for this input. This is because the pattern matching logic in the `func_2` function is not accurate and may fail in various cases.

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
