According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `v`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and the loop is executed with the range starting from 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 and should be less than the length of `v`.
State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string, `v` has a length of at least 2, `t`, `p` is a list of zeros with the length of `v`, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, `p` at index `i` is assigned the value of `j`**
