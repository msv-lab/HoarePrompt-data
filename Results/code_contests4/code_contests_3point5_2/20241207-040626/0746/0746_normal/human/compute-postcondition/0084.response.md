Functionality: The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`, where `t` and `s` are strings containing lowercase English letters, and `c` is an integer within the range 1 to 1,000,000. The function then performs different operations based on the length of string `s`:

1. If the length of `s` is 1, it calculates the sum of valid calculations based on the condition `c(i, s[0])`.
2. If the length of `s` is 2, it counts the number of times `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])` are both true for consecutive elements in list `t`.
3. For other cases, it iterates through the strings `t` and `s` to determine the total number of times specific conditions are met.

The function returns the respective results based on the conditions met during the execution. It appears that there might be missing logic or edge cases not covered by the annotations regarding the behavior of the function when the lengths of `s` are different from 1 or 2.
