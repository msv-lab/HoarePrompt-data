According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `t` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is 2, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1, `t` has a length of at least 3, and there exists an index `i+1` such that `c(t[i+1], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 2], s[1])` are both true. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions need to be met:
1. `ans` remains 2.
2. `s` remains a string with length 2 and not equal to 1.
3. `t` still has a length of at least 3.
4. There exists an index `i+2` such that `c(t[i+2], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 3], s[1])` are both true.

State: **`ans` is 2, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1, `t` has a length of at least 3, there exists an index `i+2` such that `c(t[i+2], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 3], s[1])` are both true**.
