According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than the length of `t` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is 1, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1, `t` has a length of at least 3. There exists an index `i` such that `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])` are both true. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 and should be less than the length of `t` - 1.
State: **`ans` is 1, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1, `t` has a length of at least 3, there exists an index `i+1` such that `c(t[i+1], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 2], s[1])` are both true**
