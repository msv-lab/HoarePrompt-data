Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `s` is a string, `v` has a length of at least 2, `t`, `p` is a list with values based on the pattern of `j` updates in the loop, `i` is the length of `v` - 1, `j` is a value based on the updates in the loop where `v[j]` is equal to `v[i]`, for the loop to execute `len(v)` is greater than 0. Additionally, `p[i]` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, `c(v[i - p[i]], s[0])` is true, and `c(v[i + 1], s[-1])` is true***.
