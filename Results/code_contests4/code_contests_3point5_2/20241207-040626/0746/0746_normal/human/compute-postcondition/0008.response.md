Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated based on the condition c(i, s[0]), `s` remains the same, `t` is the remaining elements in the iterable after `i`, and `i` is the next element in `t`. If the condition c(i, s[0]) is true, then `ans` is updated. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
