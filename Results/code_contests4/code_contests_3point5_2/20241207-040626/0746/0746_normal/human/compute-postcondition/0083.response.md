The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`. `t` and `s` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and `c` is an integer such that 1 <= c <= 1,000,000. 

After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the conditions:

Case_1: The program returns the sum of all valid calculations based on the condition c(i, s[0]).
Case_2: The program returns the number of times c(t[i], s[0]) and c(t[i + 1], s[1]) are both true for consecutive elements in list t.
Case_3: The program returns the integer value of 'ans', representing the total number of times the conditions were met in the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two strings `t` and `s`, and an integer `c`, and return different values based on specific conditions related to the inputs.
