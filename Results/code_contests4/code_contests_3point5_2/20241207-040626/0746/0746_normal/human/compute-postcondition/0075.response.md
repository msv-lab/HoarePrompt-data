According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `v`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `ans` should be further increased by 1 and `i` should be incremented by 1 as well.
State: **`ans` is increased by 2, all other variables retain their original values**
