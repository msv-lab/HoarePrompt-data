Postcondition: ***`ans` is 0, `s` is a string, `v` has a length of at least 2, `t`, `p` is a list of zeros with the length of `v`, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to a value based on the values in list `p`, where `j` is greater than 0 and `v[j]` is not equal to `v[i]` for all iterations of the loop. Additionally, `v[j]` is equal to `v[i`]***
