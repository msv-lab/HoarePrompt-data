According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If the length of `t` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Therefore, before the loop starts, `ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1. To execute the loop, `t` must have a length of at least 3. 
State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1, for the loop to execute `t` has a length of at least 3**
