Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 3, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1, `t` has a length of at least 3, there exists an index `i+2` such that `c(t[i+2], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 3], s[1])` are both true.
Output State: **`ans` is 3, `s` is a string with length 2 and not equal to 1, `t` has a length of at least 3, there exists an index `i+2` such that `c(t[i+2], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 3], s[1])` are both true**
