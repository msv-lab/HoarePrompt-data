The function func_1 accepts a list of compressed strings where each string is in the format "li-ci" and returns a list of lists where each inner list consists of an integer representing the total length of consecutive blocks and a corresponding character. If consecutive blocks have the same character, their lengths are summed. The function correctly processes the input strings and organizes them into the desired format.
