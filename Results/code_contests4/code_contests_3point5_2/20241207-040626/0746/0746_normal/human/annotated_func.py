#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 200,000.
- Each block of the compressed strings t and s is represented as "li-ci" where li is the length of the block and ci is the corresponding lowercase English letter.
- 1 <= li <= 1,000,000 for each block description.
- The input format is as described in the problem statement.

    #The program returns a list of lists where each inner list consists of an integer and a corresponding character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of compressed strings where each string is in the format "li-ci" and returns a list of lists where each inner list consists of an integer representing the total length of consecutive blocks and a corresponding character. If consecutive blocks have the same character, their lengths are summed. The function correctly processes the input strings and organizes them into the desired format.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `c`, where `t` and `s` are strings containing lowercase English letters, and `c` is an integer within the range 1 to 1,000,000. The function then performs different operations based on the length of string `s`:

1. If the length of `s` is 1, it calculates the sum of valid calculations based on the condition `c(i, s[0])`.
2. If the length of `s` is 2, it counts the number of times `c(t[i], s[0])` and `c(t[i + 1], s[1])` are both true for consecutive elements in list `t`.
3. For other cases, it iterates through the strings `t` and `s` to determine the total number of times specific conditions are met.

The function returns the respective results based on the conditions met during the execution. It appears that there might be missing logic or edge cases not covered by the annotations regarding the behavior of the function when the lengths of `s` are different from 1 or 2.
