Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not accurately implement the problem description. The program is missing the logic to find all occurrences of string `s` in string `t` based on the compressed form of the strings. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the search for occurrences of `s` in `t` as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
