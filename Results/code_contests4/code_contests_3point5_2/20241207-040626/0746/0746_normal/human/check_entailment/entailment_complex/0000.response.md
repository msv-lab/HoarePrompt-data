Correctness: **False**

The function `func_2` in the provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. The annotations suggest that there might be missing logic or edge cases not covered by the code, particularly when the lengths of the strings `s` are different from 1 or 2. The function implementation does not seem to adequately address all possible scenarios outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
