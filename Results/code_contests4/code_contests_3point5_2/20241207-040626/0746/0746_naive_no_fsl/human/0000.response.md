Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to correctly find all occurrences of string s in string t based on the problem description. The logic implemented in the `func_2` function does not handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Specifically, the function `func_2` uses a pattern matching algorithm that is not correctly implemented to find all occurrences of the compressed string s within the compressed string t. The implementation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm in the function is flawed and does not cover all possible cases.

To verify the correctness of the program, a more thorough testing of edge cases and potential scenarios is required. Although no specific example is provided in the problem description, the existing logic in the program is not sufficient to accurately determine the number of occurrences of s in t for all possible inputs.
