Output State: **`end`, `pos`, `add`, `cross`, `line` are all variables with their final values determined by the loop code. If the loop executes and reaches the end, the final values will depend on the conditions met during each iteration. If the loop does not execute, the final values will be based on the initial values of the variables.**
