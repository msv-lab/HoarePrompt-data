Postcondition: ***`end`, `pos`, `add`, `cross`, `line` are all variables with their initial descriptions. If `add` is equal to `step` and `cross` is False, the program will return False, False. Otherwise, if `pos > 0 and line[pos - 1]`, `pos` is decreased by 1. If `add` is equal to `step` and `cross` is False, then if `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is True, the function will return False, False. Otherwise, no changes will occur to the variables.***
