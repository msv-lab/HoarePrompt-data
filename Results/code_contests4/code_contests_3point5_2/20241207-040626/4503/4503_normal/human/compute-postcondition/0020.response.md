Example Answer:
`line` is assigned a copy of itself, denoted by `line[:]`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `end` is the length of the next element in the `side` list, `pos` is `start`, `add` is further decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`, `step` is 1, `line` is the next element in the `side` list for the loop to execute the second time.
Output State: **`end` is the length of the next element in the `side` list, `pos` is `start`, `add` is further decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`, `step` is 1, `line` is the next element in the `side` list for the loop to execute the second time**
