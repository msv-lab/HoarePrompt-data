Example Answer:
The variable `cross` is assigned the value 0. The values of `end`, `pos`, and `add` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is 0.
Output State: **`end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is 0**
