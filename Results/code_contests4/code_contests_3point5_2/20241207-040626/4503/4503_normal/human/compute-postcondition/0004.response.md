According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `side` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, and `cross` is 0. So for the loop to execute the first time, `end` should be the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` should be `start - 1`, `add` should be decreased by 1, `cross` should be 0, `step` should be 0, and `line` is the first element in the `side` list.
State: **`end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is 0, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element in the `side` list for the loop to execute the first time**
