Postcondition: ***`end`, `pos`, `add`, `cross`, `line` are all variables. If `add` is equal to `step` and `cross` is False, the function returns False, False. If `add` is equal to `step` and `cross` is False, then if `pos > 0 and line[pos - 1]`, `pos` is decreased by 1. If `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is True, the function returns False, False. Otherwise, `line` is assigned a copy of itself and `cross` is assigned the result of `func_1(line, end, pos, left)`. After the if statement, if the condition is not met, `pos` is increased by 1.***
