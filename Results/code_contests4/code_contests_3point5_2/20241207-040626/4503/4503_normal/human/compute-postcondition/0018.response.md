Postcondition: ***`end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 2`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element in the `side` list for the loop to execute the first time. If `add` is equal to `step`, then `cross` is false. `pos` is greater than 0 and the element at `line[pos - 1]` is true if the if part is executed. If the else part is executed, `end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start`, `add` is decreased by 1, `cross` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`, `step` is 0, `line` is the first element in the `side` list for the loop to execute the first time. If `add` is equal to `step`, then `cross` is false. `pos` is not greater than 0, `line[pos - 1]` is false. Moreover, `pos` is less than `end` and `line[pos]` is true after the execution of the if else block.***
