Example Answer:
`pos` is assigned the value of `start - 1`. The value of `start` is unknown in the initial state, so the value of `pos` cannot be calculated accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`.
Output State: **`end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`**
