Example Answer:
The value of `add` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `add` is unknown, so the output state is: `end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`end` is the length of the first element of the `side` list, `pos` is `start - 1`, `add` is decreased by 1**
