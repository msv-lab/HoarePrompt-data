#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. Based on the conditions mentioned in the code, the function returns False in multiple cases. It returns the value of `pos` after meeting specific conditions in one case, and it returns the value of `pos` incremented by 1 in another case. However, the code does not handle the scenario where the conditions are not met for any of the cases mentioned in the annotations.

If the loop does not execute, the final values will be based on the initial values of the variables.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four integer parameters `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left`. The function iterates through the `side` list based on certain conditions, and if a specific condition is met, it calls another function `func_1` to calculate the value of `cross`. The function then updates the position `pos` accordingly. At the end, the function returns the final value of `cross` and the value of `pos` incremented by 1. The program has multiple return points where it can return False, False, or the final values mentioned above.
