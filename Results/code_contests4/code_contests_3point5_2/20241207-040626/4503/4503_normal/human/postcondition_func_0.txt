The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. Based on the conditions mentioned in the code, the function returns False in multiple cases. It returns the value of `pos` after meeting specific conditions in one case, and it returns the value of `pos` incremented by 1 in another case. However, the code does not handle the scenario where the conditions are not met for any of the cases mentioned in the annotations.
