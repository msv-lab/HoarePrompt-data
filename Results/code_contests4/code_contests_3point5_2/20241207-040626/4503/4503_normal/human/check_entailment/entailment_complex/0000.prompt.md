You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n vertical lines in the Amidakuji. This Amidakuji meets the following conditions.

* Draw a horizontal line right next to it. Do not pull diagonally.
* Horizontal lines always connect adjacent vertical lines. In other words, the horizontal line does not cross the vertical line.
* For any vertical line, horizontal lines will not appear at the same time on the left and right from the same point. That is, the horizontal line does not cross the vertical line.
* There is only one hit.



The figure below shows an example of Amidakuji when n = 5. The numbers on the top represent the vertical line numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 from the left). ☆ is a hit.

<image>


Create a program that reads the number of vertical lines n, the number m of the selected vertical line, the location of the Amidakuji hit, and the presence or absence of horizontal lines in each row, and outputs a judgment as to whether or not the hit can be reached. However, only one horizontal line can be added at any position in the given Amidakuji (it is not necessary to add it). The Amidakuji after adding one horizontal line must also meet the above conditions.



Input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is as follows:

The number of vertical lines n (1 <n ≤ 10) is written on the first line.
On the second line, the number m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) of the selected vertical line is written.
On the third line, the number of the hit place (☆ in the figure) is written counting from the left.
On the 4th line, the number of stages d (1 ≤ d ≤ 30) of Amidakuji is written.
From the 5th line onward, n-1 numbers are lined up in order from the top of the Amidakuji, with 1 being the horizontal line between each vertical line and 0 being the absence, as in the sequence of numbers corresponding to the figure. is.


The input ends on a line with a single 0.

Output

For each dataset, output the following values ​​depending on whether you can reach the hit from the selected vertical line number m.

* Output 0 if you can reach the hit without drawing a horizontal line.
* If you can reach the hit by drawing one horizontal line, output the position of the horizontal line closest to the starting side (upper in the figure). Please output the number of steps (see the figure) counting from the departure side and the number of vertical lines counting from the left to draw the horizontal line to the right, separated by a half-width space.
* If you cannot reach the hit even if you draw one horizontal line, output 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `line`, `end`, `pos`, and `left`. Based on the conditions mentioned in the code, the function returns False in multiple cases. It returns the value of `pos` after meeting specific conditions in one case, and it returns the value of `pos` incremented by 1 in another case. However, the code does not handle the scenario where the conditions are not met for any of the cases mentioned in the annotations.

If the loop does not execute, the final values will be based on the initial values of the variables.

    #The program returns the final value of 'cross' and the value of 'pos' incremented by 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four integer parameters `start`, `side`, `add`, and `left`. The function iterates through the `side` list based on certain conditions, and if a specific condition is met, it calls another function `func_1` to calculate the value of `cross`. The function then updates the position `pos` accordingly. At the end, the function returns the final value of `cross` and the value of `pos` incremented by 1. The program has multiple return points where it can return False, False, or the final values mentioned above.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
