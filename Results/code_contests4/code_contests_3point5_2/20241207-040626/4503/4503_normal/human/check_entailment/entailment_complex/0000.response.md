Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` and `func_2` have multiple return points where they return False, which indicates that the code may not always follow the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the scenario where the conditions are not met for any of the cases mentioned in the annotations. This inconsistency makes the code incorrect as it does not guarantee correct behavior for all possible inputs.
