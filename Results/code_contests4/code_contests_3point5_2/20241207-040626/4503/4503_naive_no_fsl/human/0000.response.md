Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program implements the logic to determine if the hit can be reached from the selected vertical line number m in an Amidakuji scenario. It follows all the conditions specified in the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the logic of adding a horizontal line and checking if the hit can be reached. The program iterates through different steps and directions to find the correct path.

Since the program has defined functions to handle the logic based on the conditions provided in the problem description and iterates through all potential cases, it covers all possibilities and meets the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
