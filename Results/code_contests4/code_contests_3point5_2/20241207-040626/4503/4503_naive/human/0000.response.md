Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program follows the problem description by checking if the hit can be reached without drawing a horizontal line, if it can be reached by drawing one horizontal line, and if it cannot be reached even with one horizontal line. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the logic of adding horizontal lines and checking if the hit can be reached. The program iterates through different scenarios to find the optimal solution. The code accounts for all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each dataset.
