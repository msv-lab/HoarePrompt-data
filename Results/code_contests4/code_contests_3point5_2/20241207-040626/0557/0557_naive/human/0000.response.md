Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the number of combinations of a, b, c, and d that satisfy the condition a + b + c + d = n for each given input n. It utilizes dynamic programming to store the results for each n value, avoiding redundant calculations. The program iterates through all possible values of a, b, c, and d within the given range and counts the combinations that satisfy the condition. The logic seems sound and the program should work correctly for all potential cases within the specified constraints.
