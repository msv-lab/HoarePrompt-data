Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly reads the input integer `n`, calculates all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` that satisfy the equation a + b + c + d = n within the specified ranges, and stores the count of valid combinations in the `ans` list at index `n`. The program then outputs this count for each dataset.

The program follows the problem description by correctly calculating the number of combinations that satisfy the conditions for each input `n` within the specified ranges.
