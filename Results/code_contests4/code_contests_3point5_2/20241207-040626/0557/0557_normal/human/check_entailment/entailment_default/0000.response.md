Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the program correctly follows the problem description. It reads input from stdin, calculates four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` in the range 0-1000 that satisfy the equation a + b + c + d = n, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 4,000. The function then stores the calculated sum in the `ans` list at index `n` and prints it. The code iterates through all possible combinations of a, b, c, and d to find the number of combinations that satisfy the condition. Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem, the correctness is marked as True.
