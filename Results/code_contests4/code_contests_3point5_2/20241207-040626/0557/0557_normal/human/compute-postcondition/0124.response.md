Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by the value of `ran`. The previous values of the variables are not given, so the new value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`, `a`, `n`, `e1`, `nab` is decremented by 1, `ran` has a new calculated value.
Output State: **`count` is incremented by the value of `ran`, `a`, `n`, `e1`, `nab` is decremented by 1, `ran` has a new calculated value**
