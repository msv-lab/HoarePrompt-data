According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is incremented by the sum of `ran` values calculated in each iteration of the loop. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be less than 1000.
State: **`count` is incremented by the sum of `ran` values calculated in each iteration, all other variables remain the same, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be less than 1000**
