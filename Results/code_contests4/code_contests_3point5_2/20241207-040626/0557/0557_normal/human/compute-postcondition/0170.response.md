Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input from stdin, calculates four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` in the range 0-1000 that satisfy the equation a + b + c + d = n, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 4,000. The function then stores the calculated sum in the `ans` list at index `n` and prints it. The function does not actually return the calculated integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` as mentioned in the annotations, and it exits after processing all input.**
