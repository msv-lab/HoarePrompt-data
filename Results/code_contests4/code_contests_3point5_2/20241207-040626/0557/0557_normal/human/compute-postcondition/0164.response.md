Example Answer:
The value of `count` is assigned to `ans[n]`, where `n` is the index. The previous value of `count` is stored in `ans[n]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` contains the sum of all positive `ran` values calculated in each iteration of the loop. All other variables retain their values as described in the code.
Output State: **`count` contains the sum of all positive `ran` values calculated in each iteration of the loop. All other variables retain their values as described in the code**
