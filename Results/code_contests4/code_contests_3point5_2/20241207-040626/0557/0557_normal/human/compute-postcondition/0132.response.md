Example Answer:
`e1` is assigned the value of `n - a - 1001` if `n - a - 1001` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it is assigned -1. The values of `n` and `a` are not specified, so the output state is: `count` is incremented by the sum of `ran` values calculated in each iteration, `n` must be less than 1000 for the loop to execute another time, and `e1` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`count` is incremented by the sum of `ran` values calculated in each iteration, `n` must be less than 1000 for the loop to execute another time, `e1` is calculated as described**
