Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`. The previous values of `count` and `ran` are unknown. If `ran` is positive, then `count` will increase by that positive value. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer with an incremented value.
Output State: **`count` is an integer with an incremented value**
