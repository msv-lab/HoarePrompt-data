Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by the sum of `ran` values calculated in each iteration. `n` is less than 1000. `e1` is calculated as described. `nab` is initialized to `n - a`, `ran` is either 1001 or -1 and is greater than or equal to 0. The loop executes based on the condition that `nab` must be greater than `e1`, with `ran` being updated accordingly.***
