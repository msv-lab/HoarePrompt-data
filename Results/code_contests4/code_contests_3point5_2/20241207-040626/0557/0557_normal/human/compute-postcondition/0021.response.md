According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is the sum of the calculated values of `ran` in each iteration of the loop. All other variables retain their initial values. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be less than 1000 + 1.
State: **`count` is the sum of the calculated values of `ran` in each iteration of the loop, all other variables retain their initial values, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be less than 1000 + 1**
