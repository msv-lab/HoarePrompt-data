Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer assigned from input. `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers in the range 0-1000 satisfying a + b + c + d = n. `ans` is a list of 4001 elements initialized with zeros. If not ans[n], the variables `count`, `nab`, `a`, `e1`, `ran` have final values based on loop conditions and calculations.***
