Example Answer:
The `exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program. As a result, no further calculations or changes occur to any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: The value stored in `ans` at index `n` contains the sum of all positive `ran` values calculated in each iteration of the loop for all valid values of `n`. All other variables retain their values as described in the code.
