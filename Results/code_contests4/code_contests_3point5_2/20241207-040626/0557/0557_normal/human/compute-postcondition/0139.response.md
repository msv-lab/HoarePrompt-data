Output State: **`count` is incremented by the sum of `ran` values calculated in each iteration, `n` is less than 1000, `e1` is calculated as described, `nab` is initialized to `n - a`, `ran` is either 1001 or -1 and is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute another time `nab` must be greater than `e1, `ran` is assigned the value of `(nab if nab < 1000 else 1000) - (nab - 1001 if nab > 1000 else -1)`**
