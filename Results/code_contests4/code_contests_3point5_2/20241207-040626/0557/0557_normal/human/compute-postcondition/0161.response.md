Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by the sum of all positive `ran` values, `n` remains less than 1000, `e1` is calculated, `nab` is within the range of `n - a` and `e1`, `ran` is 1001, loop executes within the range `n - a` and `e1`, decrementing by 1, `ran` is updated to the value of `(nab - 1001)` if `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
