Example Answer:
The value of `n` is converted to an integer. Depending on the value of `ans[n]`, the count may or may not be updated. If `ans[n]` is False, the count is updated based on conditions for `nab` and the new value is assigned to `ans[n]`. If `ans[n]` is True, no changes occur. 
Output State: **The value stored in `ans` at index `n` is printed. If `ans[n]` is False, then the count is updated based on conditions for `nab` and `ans[n]` is assigned the updated value of `count`. If `ans[n]` is True, then no changes occur.**
