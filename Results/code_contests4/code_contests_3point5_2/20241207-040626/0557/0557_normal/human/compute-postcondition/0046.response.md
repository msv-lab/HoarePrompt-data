Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by the value of `ran`, so the new value of `count` is the previous value of `count` plus the value of `ran`. The values of `nab` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is incremented by the value of `ran`, `nab` is within the range from `n - a + 1` to `e1`, `a` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`count` is incremented by the value of `ran`, `nab` is within the range from `n - a + 1` to `e1`, `a` is incremented by 1**
