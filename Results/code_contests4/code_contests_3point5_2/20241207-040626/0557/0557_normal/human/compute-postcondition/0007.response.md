State: **`n` is an assigned integer value from the input line, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers in the range 0-1000 satisfying the equation a + b + c + d = n, `ans` is a list of 4001 elements initialized with zeros, the element at index `n` in `ans` is currently 0, `count` is 0, for the loop to execute `a` is within the range of 0 to `n` or 0 to 1000, element at index `n` in `ans` is updated to the new value after each iteration, `count` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, `e1` is calculated based on the formula provided.**
For the loop to execute the first time `nab` is within the range of `n - a` to `e1`, `n - a` is the starting point, `e1` is the ending point, and the loop decrements by 1 in each iteration.
