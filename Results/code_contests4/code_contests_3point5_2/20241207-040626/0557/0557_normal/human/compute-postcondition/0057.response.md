According to the code, the loop iterates through each line in the standard input stream `stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, the value stored in `ans` at index `n` is printed. No other variables are affected or changed. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition for the loop to continue is that there are more lines available in the standard input stream `stdin`.
State: **The value stored in `ans` at index `n` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time there are more lines available in the standard input stream `stdin`**
