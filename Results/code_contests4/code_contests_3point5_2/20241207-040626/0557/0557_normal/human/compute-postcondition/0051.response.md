Postcondition: ***`count`, `nab`, `a`, `ran` are integers. If `ran` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is further incremented by the value of `ran`. `nab` remains within the range from `n - (a + 1)` to `e1`, `a` is further incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, and `ran` has been calculated based on the conditions provided.***
