The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` in the range 0-1000 that satisfy the equation a + b + c + d = n, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 4,000. The function then returns these four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to calculate and return four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` that satisfy the equation a + b + c + d = n, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 4,000.
