Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by the sum of all positive `ran` values, `n` remains less than 1000, `e1` is calculated, `nab` is greater than `e1`, `ran` is either 1001 or -1 and is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute each time `nab` is within the range `n - a` and `e1`, decrementing by 1. Additionally, `ran` is greater than or equal to 0.***
