Example Answer: 
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The value of `ix` is 1, so `ix ^ 1` is 0. The values of `j` and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than `b + 1, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than `b + 1, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[0][j][k]`**
