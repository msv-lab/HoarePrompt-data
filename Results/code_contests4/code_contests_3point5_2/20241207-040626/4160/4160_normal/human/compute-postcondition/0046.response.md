Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are known, but the values inside `mem` arrays are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` will have the value of 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`.
Output State: **`ix` will have the value of 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`**
