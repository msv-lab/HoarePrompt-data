Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, `k`, and all other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, all values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, all values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range.**
