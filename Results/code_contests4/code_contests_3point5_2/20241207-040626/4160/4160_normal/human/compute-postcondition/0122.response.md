Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value stored in `ans`, which is the sum of all values in `mem[n & 1][m][i]` for valid values of `i` within the range of `b + 1` for all iterations of the loop. All other variables maintain their initial conditions.
Output State: **`ans` will be the sum of all values in `mem[n & 1][m][i]` for valid values of `i` within the range of `b + 1` for all iterations of the loop. All other variables maintain their initial conditions**
