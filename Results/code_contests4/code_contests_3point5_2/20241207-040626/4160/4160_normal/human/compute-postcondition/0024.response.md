Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j+1`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` are at their final states, `j+1` is less than `m, `k` starts at `a[i - 1]` and ends at `b + 1`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j+1][k], and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k].
Output State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j+1`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` are at their final states, `j+1` is less than `m, `k` starts at `a[i - 1]` and ends at `b + 1`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j+1][k], and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]**
