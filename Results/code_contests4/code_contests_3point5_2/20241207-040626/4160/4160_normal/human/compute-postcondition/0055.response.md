According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2 and `m` should still be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range**
