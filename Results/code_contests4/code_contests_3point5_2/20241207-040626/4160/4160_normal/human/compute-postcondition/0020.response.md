According to the code, the loop can execute if the range defined by `a[i - 1]` and `b + 1` is valid. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` are at their final states, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m`, `k` starts at `a[i - 1]` and ends at `b + 1`**
