According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `ix`, and `j`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ix` is 0
- `j` is `m + 2`
- `m` is greater than or equal to -2
- `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`
- `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`
- `n` is at least 1
- The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`

To execute the loop one more time:
- `ix` remains 0
- `j` remains `m + 2`
- `m` remains the same as it is not specified to change
- `a[i - 1]` should still be a valid index in list `a`
- `b` should still be within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`
- `i` should increment to `n + 2`
- `k` should iterate from `a[i - 1]` to `b`
- `n` should be at least 1 as specified
- The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` should be assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`

State: **`ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to -2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `i` is `n + 2`, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `n` is at least 1, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`**
