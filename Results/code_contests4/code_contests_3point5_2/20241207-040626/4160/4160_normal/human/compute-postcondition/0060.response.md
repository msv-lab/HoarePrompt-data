Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `k` is updated to the next value within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` after executing the given code**
