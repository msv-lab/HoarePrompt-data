Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The variables `ix`, `j`, `k`, `a`, and `mem` remain at their final values. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` remain at their final values, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` for the loop to execute one more time, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` remain at their final values, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` for the loop to execute one more time, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated**
