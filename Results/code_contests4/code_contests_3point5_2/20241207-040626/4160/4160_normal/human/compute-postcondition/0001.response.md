Example Answer:
The lambda function `mult` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, calculates the product of `a` and `b` modulo `mod`, and then returns the result. Since the values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, the output state is: n, m, b, and mod are all positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ b ≤ 500, and 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7. The list a contains n non-negative integers where each integer is less than or equal to 500.
Output State: **n, m, b, and mod are all positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ b ≤ 500, and 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7. The list a contains n non-negative integers where each integer is less than or equal to 500.**
