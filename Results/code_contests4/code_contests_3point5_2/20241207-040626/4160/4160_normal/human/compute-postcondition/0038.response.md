Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to be the same as `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `b`. The previous values of `mem[ix][j][k]`, `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, `ix`, `j`, and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and the loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `b`.
Output State: **`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, and the loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `b`**
