According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and the values stored in `mem`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated, `j` is unchanged, `k` is `b`, and `i` is unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`mem[ix][j][k+1]` needs to be updated, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `b`**
