According to the code, the loop can execute if the conditions for the range of k are met. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, all values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range, for the loop to execute `a[i - 1]` is a valid index, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`**
