Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` is the XOR operation. The values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the previous values of these variables. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ix` is the result of bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list such that `a[i - 1]` is defined, `b` is defined, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b`.
Output State: **`ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ix` is the result of bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list such that `a[i - 1]` is defined, `b` is defined, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b**`
