According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `m + 2`. To execute the loop again, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, which implies `m + 2` should be less than or equal to `m`. This implies `m` should be greater than or equal to -2.

State: **All values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range, `ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to -2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `n` is at least 1. The final state of the loop will be the last updated values of `mem`.**
