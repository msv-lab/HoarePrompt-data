Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The specific values of `ix`, `j`, `k`, `a`, and `mem` are not provided, so the resulting value of `mem[ix][j][k]` cannot be calculated accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` will have the value of 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`.
Output State: **`ix` will have the value of 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`**
