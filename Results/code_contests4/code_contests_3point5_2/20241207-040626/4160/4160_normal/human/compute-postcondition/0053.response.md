Example Answer:
`mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be less than `b + 1, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated based on the operation provided.**
