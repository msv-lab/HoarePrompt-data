According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `a`, `b`, and the range of `k`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` are at their final states, `j` is less than `m`, `k` starts at `a[i - 1]` and ends at `b + 1`, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j+1`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` are at their final states, `j+1` is less than `m`, `k` starts at `a[i - 1]` and ends at `b + 1`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j+1][k]**
