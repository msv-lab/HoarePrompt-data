According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`. Since `i` is iterated by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`.
State: **All values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range. `ix` is 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is `n + 1**
