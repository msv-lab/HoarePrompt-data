Example Answer: 
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `ix`, `j`, and `k` are known, but the values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to -2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `n` is at least 1, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to -2, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `n` is at least 1, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`**.
