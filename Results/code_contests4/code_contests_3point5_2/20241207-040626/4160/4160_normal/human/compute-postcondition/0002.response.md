Output State: **n, m, b, and mod are all positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ b ≤ 500, and 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7. The list a contains n non-negative integers where each integer is less than or equal to 500. rints is a lambda function that reads integers from stdin and returns a list of integers.**
