Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` represents the XOR operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` remain at their final values, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after `a[i - 1]`, `b` is greater than or equal to the next value after `a[i - 1]` for the loop to execute one more time, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` remain at their final values, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after `a[i - 1]`, `b` is greater than or equal to the next value after `a[i - 1]` for the loop to execute one more time, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated**
