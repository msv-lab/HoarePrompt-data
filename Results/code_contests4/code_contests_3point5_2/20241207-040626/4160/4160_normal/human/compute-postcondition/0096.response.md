Output State: **All values of `mem` have been updated, `ix` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `i` is `n + 1, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time the next valid value of `k` should be considered within the specified range. The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`.**
