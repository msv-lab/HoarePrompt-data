According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, and `b`. If `k` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its final state, `a[i - 1]` and `b + 1` determine the range for `k`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value after the previous iteration. So, `k` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j+1`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` are at their final states, `j+1` is less than `m, `k` starts at `b + 1` and ends at `b + 2`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j+1][k], and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k].**
