Output State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j+1`, `a`, `b`, `mem` are at their final states, `j+1` is less than `m, `k` starts at `b + 1` and ends at `b + 2`, `mem[ix][j+1][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j+1][k], and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]. `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated by adding the value of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` to it.**
