According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 0 since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `m + 1`. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ix` is the result of bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `j` is 1.
State: **`ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ix` is the result of bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `j` is 1**
