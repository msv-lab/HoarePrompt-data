Output State: **All values of `mem` will be updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range. `ix` will remain 0, `j` will remain `m + 2`, `m` will remain greater than or equal to -2, `a[i - 1]` will still be a valid index in list `a`, `b` will be within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `i` will remain `n + 1`, for the loop to execute `k` will range from `a[i - 1]` to `b`, `n` will be at least 1. The final state of the loop will be the last updated values of `mem`.**
