Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `ix` is the result of a bitwise XOR operation between `i` and 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ix` is the result of bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list such that `a[i - 1]` is defined, `b` is defined, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is adjusted to the next value within the range `[a[i - 1], b]`.
Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ix` is the result of bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list such that `a[i - 1]` is defined, `b` is defined, `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `b, `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated to `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is adjusted to the next value within the range `[a[i - 1], b]`**
