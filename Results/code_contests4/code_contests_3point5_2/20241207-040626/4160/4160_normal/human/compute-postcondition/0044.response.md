According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ix` will have the value of `i` bitwise AND 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`ix` will have the value of `i` bitwise AND 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
