According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `k`, and `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` remain at their final values, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `k` should be increased by 1 to move to the next value in the range.
- `k` should be less than or equal to `b` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` remain at their final values, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is equal to the next value after `a[i - 1]`, `b` is greater than or equal to the next value after `a[i - 1]` for the loop to execute one more time, and the value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated**
