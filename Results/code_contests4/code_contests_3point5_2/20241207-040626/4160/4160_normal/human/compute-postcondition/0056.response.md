According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and the validity of the index `a[i - 1]` in list `a`. 

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `k` should be within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`
- `a[i - 1]` should be a valid index in list `a`
- `b` should be within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`
- `ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- Values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range

State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`**
