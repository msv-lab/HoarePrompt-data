According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and the condition `j` being less than `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. Before the loop starts, to ensure the loop can execute, the variable `k` should be equal to `a[i - 1]` and `b` should be greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]`. 
State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j` are at their final states, `a`, `b`, and `mem` have their final values, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `b` is greater than or equal to `a[i - 1]` for the loop to execute one more time**
