Output State: **All values of `mem` have been updated based on the operations inside the loop for all valid values of `k` within the specified range, `ix` holds the result of the bitwise AND operation between `i` and 1, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `i` is `n + 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, `k` is `a[i - 1` and `mem[ix][j][k]` is updated with the addition of `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]`**
