Functionality: **The function calculates a value based on the elements in the list `a`, the values of `m`, `b`, and `mod`. It updates the `mem` list based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the sum of specific elements within `mem` with modulo operations applied. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.**
