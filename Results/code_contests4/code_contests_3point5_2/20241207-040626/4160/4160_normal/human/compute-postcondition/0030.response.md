According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its final state. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j` are at their final states, `a`, `b`, and `mem` have their final values, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be incremented by 1**
