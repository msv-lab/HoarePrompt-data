Example Answer:
The value of `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the value of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]`, where `^` represents the bitwise XOR operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be less than `b + 1, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the updated value based on the operation `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`.
Output State: **`ix` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a[i - 1]` is a valid index in list `a`, `b` is within the range of `a[i - 1]` up to `b + 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be less than `b + 1, and `mem[ix][j][k]` is assigned the updated value based on the operation `mem[ix][j][k] = add(mem[ix][j][k], mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]])`**.
