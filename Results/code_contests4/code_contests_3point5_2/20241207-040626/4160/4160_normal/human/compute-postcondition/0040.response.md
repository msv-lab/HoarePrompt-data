Output State: **The final state of the variables after the loop executes will be that `ans`, `n`, `ix`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `mem` will remain at their final values, `j` will be less than `m`, and all elements of `mem` will be updated based on the values of `mem[ix ^ 1][j][k]` and `mem[ix][j - 1][k - a[i - 1]]` where `k` ranges from `a[i - 1]` to `b`.**
