Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of distinct good plans where all written lines contain at most b bugs. The program uses dynamic programming to update the `mem` list based on the conditions specified in the problem. It then calculates the final answer by summing specific elements within `mem` with modulo operations applied.

The program handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as the number of programmers, lines of code, bugs per line, and the modulo value. It iterates through all possible combinations of lines written by each programmer and correctly calculates the number of distinct good plans. The final answer is printed after all calculations.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
