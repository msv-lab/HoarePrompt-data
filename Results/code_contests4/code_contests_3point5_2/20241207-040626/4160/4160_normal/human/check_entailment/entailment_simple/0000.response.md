Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the number of distinct good plans and prints the answer modulo the given positive integer `mod`. The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of good plans that satisfy the constraints on bugs per line. The program iterates through the number of programmers and lines of code, updating the `mem` array based on the bugs per line and maximum total number of bugs.

The final answer is calculated by summing up all possible values of bugs within the specified range. The program correctly handles all possible cases within the given constraints and provides the correct output.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
