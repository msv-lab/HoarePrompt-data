Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the number of distinct good plans by updating the `mem` list based on certain conditions and finally prints the sum of specific elements within `mem` with modulo operations applied.
- The code considers all possible scenarios where programmers write lines of code with bugs within the specified limits and calculates the number of distinct good plans.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correctly implementing the problem description for all potential cases.
- Since the code covers all scenarios as described in the problem statement and the output hints also agree with the code's behavior, we can conclude that the code is correct for all cases.
