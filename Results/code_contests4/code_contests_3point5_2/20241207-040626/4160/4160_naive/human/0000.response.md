Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of distinct good plans that exist based on the input constraints. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of bugs in each line of code written by each programmer and ensures that the total number of bugs does not exceed the maximum allowed bugs. The program iterates through each programmer and line of code and calculates the number of distinct good plans. Finally, it prints the answer modulo mod as required. The implementation seems to cover all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
