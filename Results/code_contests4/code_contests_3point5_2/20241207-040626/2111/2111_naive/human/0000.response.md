Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly determine whether the number of colors of the arare in the bag was three or four. The program simply checks if the color yellow (`Y`) is present in the arare and then prints `Four`, otherwise it prints `Three`. This logic is incorrect as the presence of the color yellow does not determine whether there are three or four colors present in the bag.

An example where the program fails:
Input
6
G W Y P Y W

Output
Three

In this case, the program should output `Four` because there are four colors present in the bag (pink, white, green, and yellow), but the program incorrectly outputs `Three`.
