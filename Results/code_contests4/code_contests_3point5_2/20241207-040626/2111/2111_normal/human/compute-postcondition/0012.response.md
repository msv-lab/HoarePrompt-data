Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, element at index `i` in list `S` is not 'Y'. If `S[i]` is equal to 'Y', then `N` becomes -1, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` in list `S` is not 'Y'. Additionally, 'Four' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
