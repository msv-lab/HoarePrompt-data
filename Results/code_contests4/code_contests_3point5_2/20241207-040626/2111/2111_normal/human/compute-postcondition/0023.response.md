Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a list of strings `S` representing the colors of different arare. If the list `S` contains the color 'Y', the function prints 'Four' and sets `N` to -1. Subsequently, if `N` is -1, it prints 'Three'. The function does not explicitly return any value. **
