According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is assigned the value of input does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`N` is assigned the value of input, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0**
