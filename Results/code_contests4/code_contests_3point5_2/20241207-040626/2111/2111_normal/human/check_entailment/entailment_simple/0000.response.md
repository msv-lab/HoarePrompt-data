Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program does not check if the number of colors in the bag is three or four based on the input arare colors. Instead, it only checks for the presence of the color 'Y' and prints 'Four' if it finds it, and prints 'Three' otherwise. This does not align with the problem description requirements. The program should be checking for the presence of all three colors: pink, white, and green to determine if there are three colors in the bag or four.
