Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code only checks for the color 'Y' and prints 'Four' accordingly, but it does not correctly determine if the number of colors in the bag is three or four. The code does not handle cases where the bag contains colors 'P', 'W', and 'G', which are required to print 'Three'. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
