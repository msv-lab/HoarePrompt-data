Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. It fails to consider the condition where a fridge can only be opened by the owner and not by any other person acting alone. The logic in the program to calculate the minimum total cost of all steel chains is incorrect as it simply sums twice the weights of all fridges without considering the actual connections needed to make the fridges private.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 1
2 2 2
```

The correct output should be:
```
6
1 2
```

Explanation: In this case, there are 3 fridges with weights [2, 2, 2]. To make the fridges private, only one steel chain with a total cost of 6 connecting fridge 1 and fridge 2 is needed. However, the given program will output -1 as it does not consider the correct connections needed based on the weights of the fridges.
