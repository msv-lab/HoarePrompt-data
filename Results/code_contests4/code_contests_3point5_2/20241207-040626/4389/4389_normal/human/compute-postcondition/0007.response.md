According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the list `le`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than 0 and `k` should be 0 at the beginning of the loop.
State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0**
