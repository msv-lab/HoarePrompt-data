Example Answer:
`af` appends the string representation of `k + 1` concatenated with ' ' and the modulo of `(k + 1)` with `n` plus 1. Since `n` is assigned from the list `le`, and `k` is 1, the new elements appended to `af` will be '2 2' if `n` is greater than 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains '1 1', for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `af` appends '2 2'.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains '1 1', for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `af` appends '2 2'**
