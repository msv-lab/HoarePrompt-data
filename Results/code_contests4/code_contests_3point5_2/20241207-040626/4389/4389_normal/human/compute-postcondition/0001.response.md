Example Answer:
The last element from the list `le` is popped out, split by spaces, and converted into a list of integers which is assigned to variable `a`. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element**
