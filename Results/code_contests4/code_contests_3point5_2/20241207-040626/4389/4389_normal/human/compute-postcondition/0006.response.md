Example Answer:
`af` is appended with the value of 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`. The condition (m < n or n == 2) is false, meaning m is greater than or equal to n and n is not equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`**
