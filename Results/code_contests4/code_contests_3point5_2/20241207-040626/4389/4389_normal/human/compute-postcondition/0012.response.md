Example Answer: 
The code appends a string to the list `af`, where the string is formed by concatenating the value of `k + 1`, a space, and the value of `(k + 1) % n + 1`. Since `k` is 2 and `n` is assigned integer values from `le`, the value appended to `af` will be '3 1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains '1 1', `k` is 2, `af` appends '2 2', and `af` appends '3 1'.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains '1 1', `k` is 2, `af` appends '2 2', and `af` appends '3 1'**
