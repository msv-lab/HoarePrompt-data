Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes input values `n`, `m`, and list `a` obtained from the input list `le`. If the condition (m < n or n == 2) is met, the function appends -1 to the list `af` and returns None. If the condition is not met, it calculates 2 times the sum of elements in list `a`, appends this value to `af`, and generates a sequence of strings indicating pairs of numbers in the format 'k k+1' for k ranging from 1 to n. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns None.**
