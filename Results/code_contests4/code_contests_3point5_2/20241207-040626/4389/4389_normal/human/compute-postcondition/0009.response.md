According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `k`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be increased by 1. 

State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains '1 1', for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1**
