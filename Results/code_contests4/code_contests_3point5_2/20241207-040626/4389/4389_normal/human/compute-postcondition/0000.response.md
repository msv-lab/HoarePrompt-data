Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `m` are assigned using the `map` function to convert elements from a list of strings to integers. The values are taken from the last element of the list `le` after splitting it. The previous state of the variables is unknown, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`**
