According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `k`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains '1 1', `k` is 1, and `af` appends '2 2'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be 2.
State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the list `le`, `a` is a list of integers from the popped element, `af` contains '1 1', `k` is 2, and `af` appends '2 2'**
