Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. It determines whether there exists a way to make exactly m chains to secure all fridges in Hanh's apartment, while minimizing the total cost of steel chains. 

The program checks if there is a solution by comparing the number of required chains m with the number of people n and ensures that n is not equal to 2. If there is no solution, it appends -1 to the output. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum total cost by summing the weights of all fridges and creating chains connecting each fridge to the next one in a circular manner.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly handles the conditions specified and outputs the minimum total cost along with the connections between fridges if a solution exists.
