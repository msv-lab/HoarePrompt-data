Correctness: **True**

The program accurately follows the problem description. It checks if there is a valid solution by comparing the number of required chains `m` with the number of fridges `n`. If `m` is less than `n` or if `n` is equal to 2, it returns -1 as there is no valid solution. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum total cost by summing twice the weights of all fridges and then creates a sequence of steel chains connecting each fridge in a circular manner, ensuring that each fridge is private. 

The program correctly handles the cases where there is a valid solution and where there is no solution, as specified in the problem description.
