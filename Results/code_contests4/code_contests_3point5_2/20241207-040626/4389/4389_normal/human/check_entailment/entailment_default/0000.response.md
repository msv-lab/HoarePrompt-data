Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases. The main issue is that the code always generates a sequence of strings indicating pairs of numbers in the format 'k k+1' for k ranging from 1 to n, which does not guarantee that all fridges will be private. Additionally, the condition `if m < n or n == 2` does not cover all cases where a solution may not exist. The code does not consider the weights of the fridges and does not optimize the total cost of the steel chains. Therefore, the code is not correct.
