**Precondition:**

- The input consists of multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes:
  - Two integers n and m, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. 
  - n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the weights of all fridges, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- The goal is to create exactly m steel chains to make all fridges private in the most cost-effective way.
