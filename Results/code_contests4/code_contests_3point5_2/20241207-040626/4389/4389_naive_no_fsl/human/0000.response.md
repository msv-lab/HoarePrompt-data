Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the number of people and steel chains, and the weights of the fridges.
- It correctly checks if there is no solution and outputs -1 in that case.
- It calculates the minimum total cost based on the weights of the fridges and the number of people.
- It then outputs the solution by connecting the steel chains between the fridges.
- The program follows the problem description and outputs the correct result for each test case.
