According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x % div` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `x % div` needs to be equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again, `x % div` is equal to 0**
