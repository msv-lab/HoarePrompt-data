According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x % div` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, so `div` is the divisor for the current iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated after integer division by `div`, and the updated `x` must satisfy `x % div == 0`.
State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, for the loop to execute again `x % div` is 0, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`**
