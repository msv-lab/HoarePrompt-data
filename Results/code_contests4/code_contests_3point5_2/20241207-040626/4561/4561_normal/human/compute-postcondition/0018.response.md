According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `x % div == 0` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains the appended value of `div` and `x` is updated after integer division by `div`. So, to execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `fac` should contain the updated value of `div` after the append operation.
- `x` should be updated after performing integer division by `div`.
- The condition `x % div == 0` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again.

State: **`fac` contains the updated value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again, `x % div` is equal to 0**
