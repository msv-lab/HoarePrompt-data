According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, x needs to be adjusted so that it is greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5. Each request is in the form of either "+ i" or "- i" where i is an integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n, for the loop to execute the first time x is greater than 1**
