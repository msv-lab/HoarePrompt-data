Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated by performing integer division by `div`. The previous values of `x` and `div` are unknown. The appended value `fac` contains the previous value of `div`. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, for the loop to execute again `x % div` is 0, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`.
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, for the loop to execute again `x % div` is 0, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`**
