Example Answer: 
`x` is updated by performing integer division with `div`, and the previous value of `x` is divided by the value of `div`. Since `x % div` is required to be equal to 0 for the loop to execute again, the value of `x` must be divisible by `div`. 
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again, `x % div` is equal to 0**
