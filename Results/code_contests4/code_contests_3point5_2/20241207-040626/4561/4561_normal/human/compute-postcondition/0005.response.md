Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated by performing integer division by `div`. The previous value of `x` is unknown, so the new value of `x` will be updated accordingly. The value of `div` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, for the loop to execute the first time `x % div` is 0, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`.
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, for the loop to execute the first time `x % div` is 0, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`**
