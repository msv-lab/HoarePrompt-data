According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x % div` is equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is less than 1, for the loop to execute the first time `x` needs to be greater than 1. Also, `div` is assigned the value `prim[x]`, so `div` must be updated accordingly to ensure the loop executes. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the updated value of `div`, `x` is less than 1, for the loop to execute the first time `x` needs to be greater than 1, `div` is assigned the value `prim[x]`**
