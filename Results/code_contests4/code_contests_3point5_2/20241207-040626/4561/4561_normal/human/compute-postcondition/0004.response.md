According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If `x % div` equals 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `fac` contains the appended value of `div`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the values of `x` and `div` need to be adjusted such that `x % div` equals 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, for the loop to execute the first time `x % div` is 0**
