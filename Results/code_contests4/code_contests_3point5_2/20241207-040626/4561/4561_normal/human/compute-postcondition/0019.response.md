Example Answer:
`x` is updated by performing integer division with the value of `div`. Since the loop needs to execute again, `x % div` should be equal to 0. Therefore, after the execution, the Output State is: `fac` contains the updated value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again, `x % div` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`fac` contains the updated value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again, `x % div` is equal to 0**
