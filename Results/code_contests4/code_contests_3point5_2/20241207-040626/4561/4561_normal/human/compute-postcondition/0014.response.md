According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `div`. If the remainder of `x` divided by `div` is 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, which means `x` is a result of a division operation involving `div`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must remain greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, for the loop to execute the first time `x` must be greater than 1**
