According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable x. If x is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is less than 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, x needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the updated value of `div`, `x` is updated after repeated integer division by `div` until `x % div` is no longer equal to 0, `x` is less than 1 after the loop finishes, for the loop to execute again `x` needs to be greater than 1**
