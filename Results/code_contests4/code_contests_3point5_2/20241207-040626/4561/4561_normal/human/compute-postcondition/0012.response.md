Example Answer:
The value of `div` is assigned the value of `prim[x]`. The value of `x` is used to access the index of `prim`, so `div` now contains the value at index `x` in the list `prim`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1**
