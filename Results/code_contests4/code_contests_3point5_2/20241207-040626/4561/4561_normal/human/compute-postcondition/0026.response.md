According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x % div == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is less than 1, `div` is assigned the value `prim[x]`, and `x` is updated to the floor division of `x` by `div`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`fac` contains the updated value of `div`, `x` is less than 1, `div` is assigned the value `prim[x]`, `x` is updated to the floor division of `x` by `div` and for the loop to execute again `x` needs to be greater or equal to 1**
