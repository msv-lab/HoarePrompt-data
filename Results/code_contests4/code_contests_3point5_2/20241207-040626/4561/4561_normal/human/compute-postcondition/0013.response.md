Example Answer:
The value of `div` is appended to the list `fac`. The rest of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1**
