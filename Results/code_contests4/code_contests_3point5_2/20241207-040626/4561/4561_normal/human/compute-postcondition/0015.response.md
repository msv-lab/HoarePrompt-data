Example Answer:
`x` is updated by performing integer division with `div`, which means `x` is updated by dividing its value by `div` and keeping the result as an integer. The loop will continue as long as `x` is greater than 1. The value of `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, so the output state is: `fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be greater than 1**
