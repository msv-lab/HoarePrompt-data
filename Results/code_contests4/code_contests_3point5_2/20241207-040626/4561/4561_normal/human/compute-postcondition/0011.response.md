According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fac` contains the appended value of `div` and `x` is updated after integer division by `div`. The loop will continue until `x % div` is not equal to 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 1 after the update.
State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1**
