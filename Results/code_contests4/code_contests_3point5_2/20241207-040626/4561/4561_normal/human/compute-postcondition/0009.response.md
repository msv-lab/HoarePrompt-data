Example Answer:
After the code `x //= div` is executed, the value of `x` is updated to the result of integer division by `div`. The initial state mentions that for the loop to execute again, `x % div` should be 0. Hence, the value of `fac` will contain the appended value of `div`, and `x` will be updated after the division. 
Output State: **`fac` contains the appended value of `div`, `x` is updated after integer division by `div`**
