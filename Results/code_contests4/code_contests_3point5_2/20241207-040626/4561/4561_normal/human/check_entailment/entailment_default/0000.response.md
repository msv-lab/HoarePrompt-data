Based on the code provided and the problem description, let's make an initial assessment:

The program seems to handle the activation and deactivation of colliders based on whether the numbers are pairwise relatively prime to each other. It uses a function to calculate prime factors and checks for conflicts when activating colliders. The program processes the requests in the order they are received and prints the appropriate responses.

Now, let's analyze the code with the given output description:

- The code initializes the `prim` list to keep track of prime factors and `mem` list to store activated colliders.
- It processes the requests by checking if the collider is already on or off, handling conflicts, and updating the `mem` list accordingly.
- The code prints the output responses based on the processed requests.

The output hints seem to agree with the code logic and describe the handling of activation and deactivation requests along with conflicts.

Considering the initial assessment and the agreement between the code logic and output hints, it appears that the code is correctly implemented as per the problem description and handles all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
