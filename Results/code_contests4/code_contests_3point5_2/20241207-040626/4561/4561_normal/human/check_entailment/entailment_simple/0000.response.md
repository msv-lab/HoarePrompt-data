Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions that are used to determine the prime factors of a given number. This aligns with the problem description where it is necessary to check if the numbers of activated colliders are pairwise relatively prime to each other. The program correctly calculates the prime factors of a given number, which is essential for determining if there is a conflict when activating a collider. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
