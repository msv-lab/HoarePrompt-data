Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not fully adhere to the problem description. The main issue lies in the function `func_2(x)` which is responsible for calculating the prime factors of a given number `x`. The program does not correctly handle the case where two colliders are activated and their corresponding numbers are not pairwise relatively prime.

For example, if colliders 6 and 10 are activated in that order, the program should output "Conflict with 6" when attempting to activate collider 10 because 6 and 10 are not relatively prime. However, the program does not detect this conflict and simply allows collider 10 to be activated, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is thus deemed incorrect.
