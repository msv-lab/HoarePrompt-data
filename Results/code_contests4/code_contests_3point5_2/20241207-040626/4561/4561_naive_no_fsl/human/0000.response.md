Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It handles the activation and deactivation of colliders based on whether the numbers are pairwise relatively prime to each other. The program processes requests in the correct order and prints the appropriate responses for each request. The program also considers edge cases such as when the number is 1 and handles conflicts between colliders effectively. 

Overall, the program satisfies all the requirements mentioned in the problem description and there are no evident cases where it deviates from the expected behavior.
