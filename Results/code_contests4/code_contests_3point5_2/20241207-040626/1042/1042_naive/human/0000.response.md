Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program calculates the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can make by inserting one extra photo into the photobook he already has. It follows the logic described in the problem statement where for each character in the input string, it can be paired with any of the 26 letters of the alphabet (including itself) to form a distinct photobook. The formula used in the program correctly calculates this by multiplying the length of the input string by 26, which represents the number of possible pairings, and then subtracting the length of the input string to account for the original photobook. The program handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, making it correct.
