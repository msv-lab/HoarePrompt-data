Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes a string `n` as input and calculates the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can make by inserting one extra photo into the photobook. It correctly follows the problem description by considering all possible combinations of inserting one extra photo into the existing photobook. The formula used in the code is also logically sound as it calculates the total number of distinct photobooks by multiplying the length of the string by 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet), subtracting the length of the string from this result (to exclude duplicates), and then adding 1 to account for the original photobook. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
