Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program calculates the number of distinct photobooks incorrectly. The correct formula to calculate the number of distinct photobooks as described in the problem is:
Total distinct photobooks = (len(s) + 1) * 26 - len(s)

The correct program should be:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    print((len(s) + 1) * 26 - len(s))

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can make by inserting one extra photo into the photobook he already has. It follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
