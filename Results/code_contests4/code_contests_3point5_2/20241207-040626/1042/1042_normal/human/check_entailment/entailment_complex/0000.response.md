Correctness: **False**

The program does not match the problem description. The program calculates `(len(n) + 1) * 26 - len(n)` instead of calculating the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can make by inserting one extra photo into the photobook. The program simply performs a mathematical operation on the length of the input string without considering the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.
