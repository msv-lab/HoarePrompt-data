Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. It iterates through the heights from right to left, keeping track of the minimum height encountered so far. If at any point the current height is greater than the minimum height encountered so far, it checks if the difference is greater than 1. If it is, it immediately prints 'No' and exits the program. Otherwise, it updates the minimum height and continues the iteration. If the loop completes without printing 'No', it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to perform the operations as required.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and handles all possible cases.
