Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input, iterates through the list checking if each element is less than or equal to the previous one. If any element is greater than the previous one by more than 1, it prints 'No' and exits. If all elements satisfy the condition, it prints 'Yes'. The program ensures that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right as required by the problem description. The program also meets the input constraints specified.
