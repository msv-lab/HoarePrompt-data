Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of integers `arr`.
- It then iterates through the list checking if each element is less than or equal to the previous one.
- If any element is greater than the previous one by more than 1, it prints 'No' and exits.
- If all elements satisfy the condition, it prints 'Yes'.
- The code ensures that the input constraints are met, where `n` is a positive integer and the values in `arr` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, the code seems to be correctly implementing the logic required to determine if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
