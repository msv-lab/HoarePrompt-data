Output State: **`N`, `H_i`, `n`, `arr`, `last`, `i`, `d` are positive integers. `arr` is a list of converted integers from input. `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`. `i` is equal to `n - 3`, and `d` is calculated based on the previous values of `arr`, `last`, and `i`. The program prints 'No' but does not affect the values of the variables.**
