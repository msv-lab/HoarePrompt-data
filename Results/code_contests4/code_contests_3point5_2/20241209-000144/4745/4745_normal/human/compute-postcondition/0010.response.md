Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `H_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `H_i` <= 10^9, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the converted integers from input, `last` is the last element in the `arr` list, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `d` is the difference between the element at index `i` in `arr` and `last`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last` and `d` is greater than 1, then the program prints 'No'.***
