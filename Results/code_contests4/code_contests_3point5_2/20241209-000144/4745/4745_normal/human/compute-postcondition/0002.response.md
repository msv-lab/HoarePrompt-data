Example Answer: 
`last` is assigned the value of the element in the `arr` list at index `n - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the value of `n - 1` will be a valid index in the `arr` list. Therefore, `last` will be the last element in the `arr` list. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, n is a positive integer, arr is a list containing the converted integers from input, last is the last element in the arr list.**
