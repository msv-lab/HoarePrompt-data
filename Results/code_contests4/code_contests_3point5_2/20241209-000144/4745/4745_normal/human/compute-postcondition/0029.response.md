Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of integers `arr`. It then iterates through the list checking if each element is less than or equal to the previous one. If any element is greater than the previous one by more than 1, it prints 'No' and exits. If all elements satisfy the condition, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters. The code ensures that the input constraints are met, where `n` is a positive integer and the values in `arr` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**
