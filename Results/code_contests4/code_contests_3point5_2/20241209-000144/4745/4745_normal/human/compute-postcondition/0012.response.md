According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `arr`, `last`, and `d`. If the conditions `arr[i] > last` and `d > 1` are met, the loop will not print 'No'. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer, `H_i` are positive integers, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the converted integers from input, `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `d` is the difference between the element at index `i` in `arr` and `last`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`N` is a positive integer, `H_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `H_i` <= 10^9, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the converted integers from input, `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `d` is the difference between the element at index `i` in `arr` and `last`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last` and `d` is greater than 1, then the program prints 'No'.**
