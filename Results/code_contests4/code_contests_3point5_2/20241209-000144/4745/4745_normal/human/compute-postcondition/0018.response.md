Output State: **`N`, `H_i`, `n`, `arr`, `last`, `i`, `d` are positive integers. `arr` is a list of converted integers from input. `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`. `i` is equal to `n - 2`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last` and `d` is greater than 1, then the program prints 'No'. If `d` is greater than 1, the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.**
