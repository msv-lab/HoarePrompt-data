The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to output the description of the parameter constraints: N is a positive integer, and H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to describe the parameter constraints where N is a positive integer, and the values of H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9.
