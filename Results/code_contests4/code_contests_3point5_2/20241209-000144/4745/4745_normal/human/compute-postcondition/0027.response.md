Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N`, `H_i`, `n`, `arr`, `last`, `i`, `d` are positive integers. `arr` is a list of converted integers from input. `last` is the minimum value between `last` and the elements in `arr`. If at any point during the loop `d` becomes greater than 1, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the program completes without any changes to the variables.**
