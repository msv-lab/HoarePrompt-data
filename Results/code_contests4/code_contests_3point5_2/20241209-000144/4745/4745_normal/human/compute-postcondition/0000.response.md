Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input read from standard input using `stdin.readline()`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so it remains a positive integer after assignment. The values of `H_i` variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, n is a positive integer.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i (1 <= i <= N) are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, n is a positive integer**
