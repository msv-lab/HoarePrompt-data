Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `arr[i] - last`, where `i` is equal to `n - 3` and `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`. Therefore, the value of `d` is calculated based on the previous values of `arr`, `last`, and `i`.
Output State: **`N`, `H_i`, `n`, `arr`, `last`, `i`, `d` are positive integers. `arr` is a list of converted integers from input. `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`. `i` is equal to `n - 3`, and `d` is calculated based on the previous values of `arr`, `last`, and `i`.**
