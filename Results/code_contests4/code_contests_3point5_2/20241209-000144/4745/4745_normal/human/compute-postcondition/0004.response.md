Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `H_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the converted integers from input, `last` is the last element in the `arr` list, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The element at index `i` in `arr` is greater than `last`***
