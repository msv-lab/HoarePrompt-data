According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, `last`, and `d`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `arr` is a list of converted integers from input, `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`, `d` is a positive integer. If `arr[i]` is greater than `last` and `d` is greater than 1, the program prints 'No'. If `d` is greater than 1, the program prints 'No'. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Update `i` to be equal to `n - 3` (decrement `i` by 1)
- Update `last` to be the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`
- No changes need to be made to `N`, `H_i`, `n`, or `d`

State: **`N`, `H_i`, `n`, `arr`, `last`, `i`, `d` are positive integers. `arr` is a list of converted integers from input. `last` is the minimum value between `last` and `arr[i]`. `i` is equal to `n - 3`**
