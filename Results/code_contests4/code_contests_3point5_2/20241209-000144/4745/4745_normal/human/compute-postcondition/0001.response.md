Example Answer:
The code takes input from the standard input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `arr`. The previous values of the affected variables are N (positive integer), H_i (positive integers), and n (positive integer). Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H_i are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, n is a positive integer, arr is a list containing the converted integers from input.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H_i are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, n is a positive integer, arr is a list containing the converted integers from input**
