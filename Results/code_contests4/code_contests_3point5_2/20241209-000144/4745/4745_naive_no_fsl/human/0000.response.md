Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. It iterates through the squares from right to left, checking if the current square height is greater than the previous one. If it is, it calculates the difference and ensures that it is not more than 1. If the conditions are met for all squares, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
