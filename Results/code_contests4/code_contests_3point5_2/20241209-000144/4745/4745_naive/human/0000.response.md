Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through the given heights of the squares and checks if it is possible to perform the operations so that the heights of the squares are non-decreasing from left to right. It handles the case where the height of a square is greater than the previous square and ensures that the heights can be made non-decreasing by decreasing the height of the current square. The logic of the program seems to align with the problem description and it covers all potential cases.
