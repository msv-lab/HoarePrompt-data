#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9, 1 <= V, W <= 10^9, and 1 <= T <= 10^9. A is not equal to B.**
def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T
    lb = B + W * T
    if (A < B) :
        return la >= lb
        #The program returns True if la is greater than or equal to lb, otherwise it returns False.
    else :
        return lb >= la
        #The program returns whether lb (calculated based on initial values of B, W, and T) is greater than or equal to la (calculated based on initial values of A, V, and T) when A is greater than or equal to B
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts integers A, B, V, W, and T. It first calculates two values, la and lb, based on the given parameters. If A is less than B, it returns True if la is greater than or equal to lb, otherwise False. If A is greater than or equal to B, it returns whether lb is greater than or equal to la. The function serves to compare the values of la and lb based on the initial parameters A, B, V, W, and T.
