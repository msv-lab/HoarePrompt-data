Example Answer: 
`la` is assigned the value of `A + V * T`. Given the initial state, `A`, `V`, and `T` are integers within the specified range. Therefore, after execution, `la` will have a specific value calculated based on the initial values of `A`, `V`, and `T`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9, 1 <= V, W <= 10^9, and 1 <= T <= 10^9. A is not equal to B; `la` is calculated based on the initial values of A, V, and T.
Output State: **A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9, 1 <= V, W <= 10^9, and 1 <= T <= 10^9. A is not equal to B; `la` is calculated based on the initial values of A, V, and T.**
