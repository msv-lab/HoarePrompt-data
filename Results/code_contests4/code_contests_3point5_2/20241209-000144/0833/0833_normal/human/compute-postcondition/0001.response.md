Example Answer:
`lb` is assigned the value of `B + W * T`. Given that `B`, `W`, and `T` are integers within the specified range, the value of `lb` will be determined by the initial values of `B`, `W`, and `T`. The values of `A`, `V`, and `la` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9, 1 <= V, W <= 10^9, and 1 <= T <= 10^9. A is not equal to B; `la` is calculated based on the initial values of A, V, and T; lb is determined by the initial values of B, W, and T.**
