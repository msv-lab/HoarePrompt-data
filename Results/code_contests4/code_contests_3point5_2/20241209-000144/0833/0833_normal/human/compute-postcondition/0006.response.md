The function `func_1` accepts parameters A, B, V, W, and T. A and B are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9, V and W are integers such that 1 <= V, W <= 10^9, and T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^9. A is not equal to B. 

Case_1: The program returns True if A is greater than or equal to B, otherwise it returns False.

Case_2: The program returns whether lb (calculated based on initial values of B, W, and T) is greater than or equal to la (calculated based on initial values of A, V, and T) when A is greater than or equal to B.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integers A, B, V, W, and T and return True if A is greater than or equal to B. If A is not greater than or equal to B, it calculates lb and la based on the initial values and returns whether lb is greater than or equal to la.
