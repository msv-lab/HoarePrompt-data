Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. The `func_1` function calculates the positions of both children after `T` seconds and then checks if the child who is "it" can catch the other child. If the child who is "it" is at a lower coordinate initially, the function checks if his final position will be greater than or equal to the other child's final position. Similarly, if the child who is "it" is at a higher coordinate initially, the function checks if his final position will be less than or equal to the other child's final position. The code covers all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description, and the logic is correct for all potential scenarios.
