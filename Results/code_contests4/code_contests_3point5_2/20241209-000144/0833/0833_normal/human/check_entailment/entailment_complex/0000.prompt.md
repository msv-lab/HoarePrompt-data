You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two children are playing tag on a number line. (In the game of tag, the child called "it" tries to catch the other child.) The child who is "it" is now at coordinate A, and he can travel the distance of V per second. The other child is now at coordinate B, and she can travel the distance of W per second.

He can catch her when his coordinate is the same as hers. Determine whether he can catch her within T seconds (including exactly T seconds later). We assume that both children move optimally.

Constraints

* -10^9 \leq A,B \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq V,W \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq T \leq 10^9
* A \neq B
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A V
B W
T


Output

If "it" can catch the other child, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

Examples

Input

1 2
3 1
3


Output

YES


Input

1 2
3 2
3


Output

NO


Input

1 2
3 3
3


Output

NO
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A, B, V, W, and T are integers such that -10^9 <= A, B <= 10^9, 1 <= V, W <= 10^9, and 1 <= T <= 10^9. A is not equal to B.**
def func_1(A, B, V, W, T):
    la = A + V * T
    lb = B + W * T
    if (A < B) :
        return la >= lb
        #The program returns True if la is greater than or equal to lb, otherwise it returns False.
    else :
        return lb >= la
        #The program returns whether lb (calculated based on initial values of B, W, and T) is greater than or equal to la (calculated based on initial values of A, V, and T) when A is greater than or equal to B
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts integers A, B, V, W, and T. It first calculates two values, la and lb, based on the given parameters. If A is less than B, it returns True if la is greater than or equal to lb, otherwise False. If A is greater than or equal to B, it returns whether lb is greater than or equal to la. The function serves to compare the values of la and lb based on the initial parameters A, B, V, W, and T.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
