Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value at index `input() - 10` from the given list `[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 25, the valid inputs for `input()` would be in the range `[10, 25]` which corresponds to valid indices in the given list. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 25 and a value has been returned based on the input.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 25 and a value has been returned based on the input.**
