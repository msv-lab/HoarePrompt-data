Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The program is supposed to calculate and print the number of ways to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals n, given that the first card is the queen of spades. However, the program does not perform this calculation correctly. 

The main issue is that the print statement is using square brackets instead of parentheses. This causes a syntax error and the program will not run as intended. Additionally, the calculation being performed inside the print statement does not match the logic required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
