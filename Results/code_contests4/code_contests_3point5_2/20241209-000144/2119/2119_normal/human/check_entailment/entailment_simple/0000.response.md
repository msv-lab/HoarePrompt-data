Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades. It does this by accessing the pre-calculated values in the list based on the input value (n) and subtracting 10 from it to get the correct index. The values in the list represent the number of ways to get the second card for each possible sum of points.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for each potential case.
