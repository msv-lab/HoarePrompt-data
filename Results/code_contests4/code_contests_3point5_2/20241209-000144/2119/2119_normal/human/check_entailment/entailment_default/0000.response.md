Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code uses a hardcoded list to determine the number of ways to get the second card in the required way based on the user input. However, this approach is incorrect as it does not accurately calculate the number of ways. The code does not consider all valid possibilities according to the problem description. For example, when the input is 12, the code should output 4, but it outputs 4 only for the case when the input is 10. This discrepancy shows that the code does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
