Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program is a one-liner that calculates the number of ways to get the second card in the required way based on the sum of points. The program uses a list with pre-calculated values for different sums of points from 1 to 16. It then indexes this list using the input value minus 10 (as the input value is the sum of points, and we need to calculate the number of ways for the second card). This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the number of ways for the second card based on the input sum of points.
