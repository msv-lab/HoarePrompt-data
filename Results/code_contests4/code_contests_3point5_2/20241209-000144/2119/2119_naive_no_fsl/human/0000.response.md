Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately calculates the number of ways to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals n when the first card is the queen of spades. The program uses a pre-calculated list to determine the number of ways based on the input value. The list [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] covers all possible scenarios for the sum of points equaling n. Since all the examples in the problem description work correctly with the given program, we can conclude that the program is correct.
