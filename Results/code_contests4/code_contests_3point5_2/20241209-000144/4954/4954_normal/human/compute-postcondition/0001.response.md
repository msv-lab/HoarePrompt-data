Example Answer:
B is assigned the result of mapping the integers obtained by splitting the input. The values of N, M, and C are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100.
Output State: **N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100**
