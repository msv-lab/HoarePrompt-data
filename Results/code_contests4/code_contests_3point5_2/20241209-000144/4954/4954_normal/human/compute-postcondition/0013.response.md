Postcondition: ***N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100; ans is either 1 or 2 based on the condition, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute; tmp contains the result of multiplying corresponding elements of lists A and B for each index m in the range of M. If the sum of tmp and C is greater than 0, the program continues with ans set to 1 or 2 depending on the condition***
