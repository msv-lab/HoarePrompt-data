Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 0, so after execution, `ans` becomes 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100; ans is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute; tmp is a list containing the result of multiplying corresponding elements of lists A and B for each index m in the range of M. The sum of tmp and C is greater than 0.
