Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values N, M, and C along with arrays B and A. It then calculates the element-wise multiplication of arrays A and B for each row of A, checks if the sum of the products plus C is greater than 0, and increments the answer accordingly. The final count of rows meeting the condition is printed as the output. The function does not explicitly return a value. It operates under the constraints where N and M are integers between 1 and 20, and A_{ij}, B_i, and C are integers between -100 and 100.**
