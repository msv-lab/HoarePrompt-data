According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is greater than 0. Since N is guaranteed to be between 1 and 20, the loop will always execute. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100; ans is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute**
