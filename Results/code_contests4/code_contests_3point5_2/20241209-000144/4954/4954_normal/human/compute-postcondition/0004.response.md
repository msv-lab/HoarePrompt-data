Example Answer:
The code snippet reads integers from the input separated by spaces into variable `A`. However, since the initial values of N, M, and C are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of elements in `A`. The loop counter `i` remains at 0, and `ans` is still 0. Therefore, the Output State is: N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100; ans is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute.
Output State: **N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100; ans is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute**
