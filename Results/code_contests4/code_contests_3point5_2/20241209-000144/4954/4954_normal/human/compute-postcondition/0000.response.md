Example Answer:
N, M, and C are assigned values based on the input split by spaces. The values for N and M are integers between 1 and 20, and C is an integer between -100 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100.
Output State: **N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100**
