Example Answer: 
The code snippet reads a list of integers from input and maps them to list A. Since the initial state does not provide information about the input values, the values of list A are unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N and M are integers such that 1 <= N, M <= 20; C is an integer such that -100 <= C <= 100; ans is 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute; tmp is a list containing the result of multiplying corresponding elements of lists A and B for each index m in the range of M. If the sum of tmp and C is greater than 0, the program continues with ans set to 1.
