Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes input values for N, M, and C, followed by the values of B and the N sets of values for A. For each set of A values, it calculates the sum of element-wise multiplication of A and B, and checks if the sum plus C is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the count of correct solutions. Finally, it prints the total count of correct solutions.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description, ensuring that it counts the number of codes that correctly solve the problem based on the given conditions.
