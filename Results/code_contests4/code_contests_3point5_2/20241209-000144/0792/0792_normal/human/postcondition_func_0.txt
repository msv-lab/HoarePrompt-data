The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of integers `a`, sorts `a` in ascending order, finds the third element `x` in the sorted list, and then calculates the number of consecutive occurrences of `x` from the third element onwards in the list `a`. The function then prints the count of consecutive occurrences. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and it does not return any value.
