Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

The code sorts the input array `a` in ascending order and then finds the third element `x` in the sorted list. It then calculates the number of consecutive occurrences of `x` from the third element onwards in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the count of consecutive occurrences.

However, the code does not consider all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It only considers the case where the minimum product is achieved by selecting the smallest three elements in the array. It does not consider cases where there are duplicate elements in the array that could lead to different combinations yielding the minimum product.

For example, in the input:
```
5
1 3 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be `2`, as the triple (1, 2, 3) would yield the minimum product. However, the code provided would output `1` as it only considers the consecutive occurrences of the smallest element.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
