Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described in the problem description. The program simply counts the number of consecutive occurrences of the third smallest element in the sorted list, which is not the same as finding the number of triples (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible. The program does not take into account all possible combinations of triples in the array. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
