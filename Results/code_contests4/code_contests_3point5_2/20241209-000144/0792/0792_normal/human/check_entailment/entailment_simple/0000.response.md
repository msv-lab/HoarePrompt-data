Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described in the problem description. The program simply counts the number of consecutive occurrences of the third minimum element in the sorted array `a`, which is not the same as finding the number of triples (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible.

The program does not consider all possible combinations of three elements in the array to calculate the minimum product. It only focuses on the third minimum element and counts its consecutive occurrences.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
