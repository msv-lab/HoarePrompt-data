Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order with length greater than or equal to 4, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `ans` can be either 2 or 3, `i` is 5 with potential update to `ans` based on `a[i] == x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
