Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order with length greater than or equal to 3, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `ans` is 1, `i` starts at 3. If the element at index 3 of list `a` is equal to `x`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
