Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order with length greater than or equal to 4, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `ans` can be either 2 or 3, and `i` is 4. If `a[i] == x`, then `ans` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
