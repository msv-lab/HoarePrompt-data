Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the list `a` is now sorted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order**
