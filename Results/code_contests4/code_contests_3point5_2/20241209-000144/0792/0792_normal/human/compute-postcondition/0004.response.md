Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `ans` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `ans` is 1**
