Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
