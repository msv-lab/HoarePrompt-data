According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of list `a` is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order with length greater than or equal to 3, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `ans` is 1, `i` starts at 3**
