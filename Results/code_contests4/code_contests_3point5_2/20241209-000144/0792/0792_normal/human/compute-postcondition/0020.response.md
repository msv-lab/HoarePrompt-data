Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` represents the number of consecutive occurrences of the third element `x` in the sorted list `a`. The initial state mentions that `a` is sorted in ascending order with a length greater than or equal to 3, and `x` is the third element of list `a`. Therefore, the number of consecutive occurrences of `x` from the third element onward in list `a` is stored in `ans`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order with length greater than or equal to 3, `x` is the third element of list `a`, `ans` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `x` from the third element onward in list `a`.**
