Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value at index 2 of list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, the third element of `a` will be assigned to `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `x` is the third element of list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `x` is the third element of list `a`**
