Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. It simply counts the number of occurrences of the third smallest element in the array, which is not the same as finding the number of triples of indices (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is minimum possible. 

An example where the program fails:
Input:
5
1 2 2 2 3

Expected Output:
3

Explanation:
In this case, the minimum product is 1*2*2 = 4. There are 3 possible triples of indices (i, j, k) that result in this minimum product: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), and (1, 2, 5). However, the program would output 1 as it only counts the occurrences of the third smallest element.
