Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input array, sorts it, and then checks for the element at index 2 (0-based indexing) which will be the minimum possible element in the array. It then counts the number of occurrences of this element in the array and prints the count as the output. This logic correctly determines the number of triples of indices (i, j, k) such that ai·aj·ak is the minimum possible. The program works as expected for all provided examples and follows the problem description accurately.
