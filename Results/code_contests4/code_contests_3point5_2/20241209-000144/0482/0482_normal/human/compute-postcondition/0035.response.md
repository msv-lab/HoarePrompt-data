Output State: `debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers, `vals` is a list of integers parsed from the input stream up to the nth element, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is incremented by the value of `leftmost + 1`, `leftmost` is either updated to the value of `dvalk` if `dvalk` is greater than the previous `leftmost` or remains -1, `i` is incremented by 1, `val` is the next element in the `vals` list after the last iteration, `d` contains `val` as a key and appends `i` to its value list, `dval` is the value list associated with the key `val` in dictionary `d. If val is in d, and len(dval) < k, no changes occur. If len(dval) >= k, `dvalk` is assigned the value of the list at index `-k` in `dval`. After the execution of the if else block, `leftmost` is updated to the value of `dvalk` if `dvalk` is greater than the previous `leftmost` or remains -1, `count` is incremented by `leftmost + 1`.
