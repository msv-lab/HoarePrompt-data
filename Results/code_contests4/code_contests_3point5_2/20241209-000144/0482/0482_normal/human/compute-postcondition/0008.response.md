Example Answer: 
`leftmost` is assigned the value -1. The values of `debug`, `n`, `k`, `vals`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers, `vals` is a list of integers parsed from the input stream up to the nth element, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is initialized to 0, and `leftmost` is -1.
Output State: **`debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers, `vals` is a list of integers parsed from the input stream up to the nth element, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is initialized to 0, and `leftmost` is -1**
