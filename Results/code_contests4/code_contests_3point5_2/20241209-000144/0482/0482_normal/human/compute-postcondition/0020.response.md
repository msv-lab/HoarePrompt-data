Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers, `vals` is a list of integers parsed from the input stream up to the nth element, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is initialized to 0, `leftmost` is either updated to the value of `dvalk` if `dvalk` is greater than the previous `leftmost` or remains -1, `i` is 0, `val` is the first element in the `vals` list, `d` contains `val` as a key and appends `i` to its value list, `dval` is the value list associated with the key `val` in dictionary `d`. If the length of `dval` is less than `k`, the state remains unchanged. If the length of `dval` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dvalk` is the k-th element from the end of `dval`.***
