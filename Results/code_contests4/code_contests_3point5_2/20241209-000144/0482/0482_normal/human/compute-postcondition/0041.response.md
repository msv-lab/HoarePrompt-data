Example Answer:
`leftmost` is assigned the value of the list at index `-k` in `dval`. The value of `dval` and `k` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `leftmost` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `dvalk` is assigned the value of the list at index `-k` in `dval`.
Output State: **The value of `dvalk` is assigned the value of the list at index `-k` in `dval`**
