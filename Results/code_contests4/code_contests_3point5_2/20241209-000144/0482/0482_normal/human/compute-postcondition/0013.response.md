Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers, `vals` is a list of integers parsed from the input stream up to the nth element, `k` is not equal to 1, `count` is initialized to 0, `leftmost` is -1, `i` is 0, `val` is the first element in the `vals` list, `d` contains `val` as a key and appends `i` to its value list, `dval` is the value list associated with the key `val` in dictionary `d`. The length of `dval` is less than `k`***
