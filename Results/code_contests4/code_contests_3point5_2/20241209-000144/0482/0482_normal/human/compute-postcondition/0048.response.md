Postcondition: ***`debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers, `vals` is a list of integers parsed from the input stream up to the nth element. If k == 1, `count` is the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. If k is not equal to 1, `count` is the sum of all `leftmost + 1` values calculated during the loop iterations, `leftmost` is the maximum value of `dvalk` encountered during the loop iterations, `i` is equal to the total number of elements in `vals`, `val` is the last element in the `vals` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `vals` and the value is the list of indices where that value appeared, `dval` is the list of indices associated with the key `val` in dictionary `d`.***
