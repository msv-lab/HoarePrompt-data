Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user, processes it based on certain conditions, and prints the resulting count. If the value of `k` is 1, it calculates the sum of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is not equal to 1, it iterates through the input values, updating the count based on certain conditions involving a dictionary and indices. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
