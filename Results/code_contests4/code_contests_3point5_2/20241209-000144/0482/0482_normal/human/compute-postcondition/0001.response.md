Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input. The values of `n` and `k` are taken from the input stream and are integers. `sys.stdin.readline().split()[:2]` reads the input stream, splits it by spaces, and takes the first two elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers.
Output State: **`debug` is either True or False, `n` and `k` are input integers**
