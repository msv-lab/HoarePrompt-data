Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of subarrays in the input array that have at least k equal numbers. It does this by using a dictionary `d` to keep track of the indices of each unique value in the array. It then iterates through the array, updating the `leftmost` variable whenever it encounters a value that has appeared at least k times. Finally, it sums up the values of `leftmost + 1` for each iteration, which gives the total number of subarrays with at least k equal numbers.

The program follows the problem description closely and produces the correct output for all possible test cases.
