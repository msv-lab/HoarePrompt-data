Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of subarrays that have at least k equal numbers based on the problem description. The issue lies in the calculation of the `count` variable within the `func` function.

In the program, the `count` variable is updated within the for loop by adding `leftmost + 1` at each iteration. However, this logic is incorrect as it does not accurately count the number of subarrays with at least k equal numbers. The value of `leftmost` is not used correctly in the calculation.

To accurately count the number of subarrays with at least k equal numbers, the program should keep track of the number of subarrays that meet the condition by updating the `count` variable appropriately. The current implementation is flawed and does not align with the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem described, and hence, the correctness is **False**.
