Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately follow the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the code is incorrect. The code does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description. The issue lies in the calculation of the `count` variable. The logic used for updating the `count` based on the conditions involving a dictionary and indices is flawed. This results in incorrect counts for subarrays with at least k equal numbers. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
