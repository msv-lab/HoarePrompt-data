Correctness: False

The provided Python program is incorrect. It does not handle the case where k is greater than 1 properly. The logic for counting the subarrays with at least k equal numbers is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate the count of such subarrays for all potential cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 2
1 2 1 2
```
The expected output is 3, but the program will output 4. This is because the program does not correctly update the count variable when k is greater than 1.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness False.
