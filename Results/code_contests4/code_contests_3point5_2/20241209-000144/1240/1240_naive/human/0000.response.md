Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where there are multiple consecutive '/' characters in the input path. It only removes the extra '/' characters when there is exactly one '/' character present. For example, the input "//usr///local//nginx/sbin" should be normalized to "/usr/local/nginx/sbin", but the program does not handle this case and will output "//usr/local/nginx/sbin" instead.
