Correctness: False

The provided program does not handle the case where there are multiple consecutive '/' characters in the input path. It only checks for a single '/' character and does not take into account the possibility of multiple consecutive '/' characters. For example, for the input "//usr///local//nginx/sbin", the output should be "/usr/local/nginx/sbin", but the program will not handle this case correctly.
