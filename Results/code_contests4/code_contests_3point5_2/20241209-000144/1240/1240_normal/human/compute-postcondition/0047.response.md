Postcondition: ***Count is an integer, flag is an integer, a is a character read from sys.stdin. If 'a' is equal to '/', and flag is 0, then flag is set to 1. If 'a' is equal to '\n', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If flag is not 0, Count is increased by 1, flag is set to 0, and a is a character read from sys.stdin. If 'a' is not equal to '\n', Count is increased by 1, flag is set to 0, a is a character read from sys.stdin, sys.stdout.write('/') has been executed, a is written to the standard output, and flag is set to 0.***
