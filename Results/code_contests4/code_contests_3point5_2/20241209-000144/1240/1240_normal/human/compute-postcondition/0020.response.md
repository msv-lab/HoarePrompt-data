Postcondition: ***Count is an integer initialized to 0, flag is an integer initialized to 0, a is a character read from sys.stdin. The loop runs indefinitely, and the value of a is not equal to '/'. If a == '\n', a newline character has been encountered, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If a != '\n', Count is incremented by 1, flag is 0, a is assigned the value read from sys.stdin. The loop continues indefinitely, and the value of a is not equal to '/' or '\n'. If flag == 1, the character '/' is written to the standard output.***
