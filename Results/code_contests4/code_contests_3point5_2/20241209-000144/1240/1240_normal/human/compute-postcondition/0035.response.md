According to the code, the loop will always execute as it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted in a way that the loop can continue to execute indefinitely.
State: **Count is an integer, flag is an integer, a is a character read from sys.stdin. If 'a' is equal to '/', and flag is 0, then flag is set to 1. Otherwise, 'a' is a character read from sys.stdin. If 'a' is equal to '\n', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If flag is not 0, Count is increased by 1, flag is set to 0, and a is a character read from sys.stdin.**
