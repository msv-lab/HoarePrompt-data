Postcondition: ***Count is an integer, flag is an integer, a is a character read from sys.stdin. If 'a' is equal to '/', and flag is 0, then flag is set to 1. Otherwise, 'a' is a character read from sys.stdin. If 'a' is equal to '\n', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If flag is not 0, Count is increased by 1, flag is set to 0, and a is a character read from sys.stdin. After the execution of the if-else block, if flag is 1, sys.stdout.write('/') has been executed.***
