Postcondition: ***'count' is the total number of characters read from sys.stdin except for the newline character, 'flag' is 0, 'a' is the last character read before encountering a newline character. If the count is not equal to 0, the program retains the initial state. Otherwise, the program does not change as there is no else part.***
