Example Answer:
The value of `flag` is assigned as 0. The values of `Count` and `a` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `Count` is increased by 1, `flag` is 0, `a` is a character read from sys.stdin.
Output State: **`Count` is increased by 1, `flag` is 0, `a` is a character read from sys.stdin**
