Postcondition: ***Count is initialized to 0, flag is either 1 or 0, a is assigned the value read from sys.stdin. The loop continues indefinitely. When the value of a becomes '/', the program enters the if condition. If flag is 0, then flag is set to 1 and a is assigned the value read from sys.stdin. If flag is not 0, then flag remains unchanged.***
