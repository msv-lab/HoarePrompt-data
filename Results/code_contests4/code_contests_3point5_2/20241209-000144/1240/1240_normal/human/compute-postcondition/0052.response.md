The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for validating the input string representing a path to a directory. The input must start with at least one '/' and have a maximum length of 100 characters. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it serves as a validator for the input path string to ensure it meets the specified constraints.
