Postcondition: ***Count is an integer, flag is an integer, a is a character read from sys.stdin. The loop runs indefinitely. When a becomes '/', if flag is 0, flag is set to 1 and a is assigned the value read from sys.stdin. If flag is not 0, flag remains unchanged. If a is not equal to '/', and a == '\n', the loop breaks out. If a is not equal to '/' or '\n', Count is incremented by 1, flag is 0, a is assigned the value read from sys.stdin. If flag is 1, the character '/' is written to the standard output.***
