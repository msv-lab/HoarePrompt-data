The function `func_1` reads characters from the standard input until a newline character is encountered. It validates the input string representing a path to a directory by ensuring it starts with at least one '/' and has a maximum length of 100 characters. If the count of characters read is not zero, it outputs the characters read, and if it is zero, it outputs a single '/'. The function does not explicitly return any value but serves as a validator for the path string input.
