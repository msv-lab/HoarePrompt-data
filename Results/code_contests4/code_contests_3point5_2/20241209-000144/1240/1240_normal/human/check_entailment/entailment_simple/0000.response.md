Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it attempts to normalize the path by removing the extra '/' characters, it does not output the normalized path correctly in all cases. 

One major issue is that the program reads characters one by one using sys.stdin.read(1), which is not the standard way to read input in Python. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where there are multiple consecutive '/' characters in the input path. 

For example, if the input path is "//usr///local//nginx/sbin", the program will output "/usr/local/nginx/sbin" instead of the correct normalized form "/usr/local/nginx/sbin".

Therefore, the program does not fully adhere to the problem description and is incorrect.
