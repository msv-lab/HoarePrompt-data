Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` reads characters from the standard input until a newline character is encountered. It validates the input string representing a path to a directory by ensuring it starts with at least one '/' and has a maximum length of 100 characters. It then outputs the normalized form of the path as described in the problem description.

The program correctly handles the case where multiple consecutive '/' characters in the input path are replaced by a single '/' in the output, except for the case where the path is just a single '/'. In that case, it outputs a single '/' as required.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
