Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads characters from the standard input until a newline character is encountered.
- It ensures that the input path starts with at least one '/'.
- It outputs the characters read in a normalized form, which means it outputs the path with the smallest possible number of '/' characters.
- The code handles cases where there are multiple consecutive '/' characters in the input path by outputting only one '/'.
- If the count of characters read is zero, it outputs a single '/' as required for the path to the root directory.
- The code adheres to the problem description for all cases as it correctly normalizes the input path.
