Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It checks for different combinations of logo sizes and correctly determines if it is possible to fit all three logos on a square billboard without overlapping or leaving empty space. The program provides the correct output in the required format for each valid case. Additionally, the code covers different possible orientations of the logos to ensure that all scenarios are considered. Since no case has been identified where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
