Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` has multiple conditional checks based on the input coordinates, but there are potential cases not covered by the annotations or the code execution. The logic seems to be complex and might not handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The output hints also suggest discrepancies between the expected behavior and the actual code implementation. Therefore, it is likely that the code is incorrect. Further analysis and testing are needed to verify its correctness.
