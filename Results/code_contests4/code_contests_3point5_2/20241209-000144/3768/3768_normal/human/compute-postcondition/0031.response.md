Postcondition: ***x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ≤ 100. ya is equal to yb. The conditions (xa == xc and ya + yc == yb) are not satisfied. Additionally, (xa + xb != xc or ya + yc != xc) and (ya != yc or xa + xb + xc != yc) are true. The program does not change any variable values. (xb != xc or yb + yc != ya) is true. (xa == xb) is true.***
