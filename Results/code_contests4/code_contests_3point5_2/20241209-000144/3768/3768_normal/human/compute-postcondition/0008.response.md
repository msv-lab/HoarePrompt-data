Postcondition: ***x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ≤ 100. ya is less than yb. The conditions (xa == xc and ya + yc == yb) are not satisfied. After the execution of the if else block, the initial values of x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 remain unchanged. Additionally, ya is equal to yb. Moreover, xa + xb == xc and ya + yc == xc***
