Postcondition: ***x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ≤ 100. ya is less than yb. The conditions (xa == xc and ya + yc == yb) are not satisfied. After the execution of the if else block, the initial values of x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 remain unchanged. Additionally, ya is equal to yb. (xa + xb != xc or ya + yc != xc) and (ya != yc or xa + xb + xc != yc) and the program does not change any variable values. Since the if condition (ya > yb) is true, ya becomes equal to yb. It is ensured that (xb != xc or yb + yc != ya), indicating the preservation of the initial state. Additionally, (xa == xb) is true. Furthermore, the program has entered the if condition where (xc == xa and ya + yb + yc == xa)***
