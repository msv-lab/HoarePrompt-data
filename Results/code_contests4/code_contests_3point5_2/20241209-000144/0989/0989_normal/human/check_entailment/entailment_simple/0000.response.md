Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes the input period length and integer number, and then finds the smallest integer number that is periodic with the given length and greater than the input number. The program handles cases where the length of the input number is not divisible by the period length, where the first `n` characters of the input number are all '9's, and where the first `n` characters are not all '9's. The program iterates through the characters of the input number to increment the number and find the smallest periodic number greater than the input number.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
