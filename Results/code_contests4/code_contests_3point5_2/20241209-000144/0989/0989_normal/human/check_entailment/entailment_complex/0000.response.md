Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes input for the period length `n` and the integer `s`, then based on the conditions specified in the problem description, it calculates and prints the smallest integer number greater than `s` that is periodic with length `n`.

The program considers different cases such as when the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, when the initial substring of `s` contains all '9's, and when it doesn't. It correctly handles each case to produce the desired output.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
