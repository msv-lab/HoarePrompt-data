Postcondition: ***L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, A is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string. If the length of s is not divisible by n, then the program will print the original values of L, A, n, and s. If s[:n] is equal to a string of all '9's, then the code will print a string of all '9's if it is greater than s, otherwise it will print a string of '10's repeated n times.***
