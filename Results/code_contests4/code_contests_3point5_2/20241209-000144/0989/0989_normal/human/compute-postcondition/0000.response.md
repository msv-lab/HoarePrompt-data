Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. `s` is assigned the value of `stdin.readline().strip()`. The initial state does not provide information about the exact values of `n` and `s`, so the output state is: L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, A is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string.
Output State: **L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, A is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string**
