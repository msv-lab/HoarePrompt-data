Example Answer:
The variable `ans1` is assigned the value of `s` concatenated `len(s) // n` times the first `n` characters of `s`, and `tem` is assigned a list containing the first `n` characters of `s`. The length of `s` is divisible by `n`, and the first `n` characters of `s` are not all '9'. Therefore, the Output State is: *L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, A is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `ans1` is a string containing concatenated substrings of the first `n` characters of `s`, `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s*.
Output State: **L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, A is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `ans1` is a string containing concatenated substrings of the first `n` characters of `s`, `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s**.
