According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have processed the first character of `s`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:

State: **`L`, `A` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000 respectively, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `ans1` is a string containing concatenated substrings of the first `n` characters of `s, `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s` where the character at index `i` is incremented by 1 as long as it's not '9'. After executing the code, all elements in the list `tem` are set to '0'. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop needs to start processing the next character in reverse order. So, the index `i` should be decremented by 1, and it should not go below 0.
