Example Answer: 
`tem` is assigned a string consisting of '1' followed by '0's repeated n-1 times. The value of n is previously unknown, so the length of 'tem' cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, A is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, n is an input integer, s is a string. The length of s is not divisible by n.
