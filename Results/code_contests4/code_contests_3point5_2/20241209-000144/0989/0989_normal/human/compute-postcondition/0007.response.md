Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, `A` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `ans1` is a string of all '9's, `ans2` is '10' repeated `n` times. The code will print either `ans1` if `ans1` is greater than `s`, or `ans2` repeated `n` times if `ans1` is not greater than `s`**
