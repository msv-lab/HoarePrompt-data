Example Answer:
`ans2` is assigned the value of joining all elements of `tem` (which are all '0') and repeating this concatenated string `(len(s) // n)` times. Since `tem` contains the first `n` characters of `s` where all elements are '0', and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the length of `tem` is `n` and `ans2` will be a string consisting of `n` zeros repeated `(len(s) // n)` times. Therefore, the Output State is: `L`, `A` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000 respectively. `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `s` is a string. `ans1` is a string containing concatenated substrings of the first `n` characters of `s. `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s` where all elements are set to '0'. `ans2` is a string consisting of `n` zeros repeated `(len(s) // n)` times.
