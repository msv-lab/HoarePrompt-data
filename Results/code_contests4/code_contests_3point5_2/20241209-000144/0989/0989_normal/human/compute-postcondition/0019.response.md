Postcondition: ***`L`, `A` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000 respectively, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `ans1` is a string containing concatenated substrings of the first `n` characters of `s, `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s` where all elements are set to '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
