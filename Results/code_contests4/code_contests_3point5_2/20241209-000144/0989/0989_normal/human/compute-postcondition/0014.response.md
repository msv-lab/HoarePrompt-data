Postcondition: ***`L`, `A` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000 respectively. `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `s` is a string. `ans1` is a string containing concatenated substrings of the first `n` characters of `s. `tem` is a list containing the first `n` characters of `s` where the character at index `i` is incremented by 1 as long as it's not '9'.***
