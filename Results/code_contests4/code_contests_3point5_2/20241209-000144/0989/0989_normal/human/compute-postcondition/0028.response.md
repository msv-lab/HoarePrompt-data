Example Answer:
The code compares `ans1` and `s`, then prints `ans1` if it's greater than `s`, otherwise it prints `ans2`. The output state depends on the comparison between `ans1` and `s`. Since the values of `ans1`, `s`, and `ans2` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output state without additional information.
Output State: **Depends on the values of `ans1`, `s`, and `ans2`**
