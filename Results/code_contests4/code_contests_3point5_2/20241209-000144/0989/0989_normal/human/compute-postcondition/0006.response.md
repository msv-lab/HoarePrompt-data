Example Answer:
`ans1` is assigned a string of length `len(s)` consisting of all '9's. Since the length of `s` is divisible by `n` and the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9', `ans1` will be a string of all '9's. `ans2` is assigned the string '1' followed by '0' repeated `n` times. Since the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, the first `n` characters of `s` are all '9', therefore the value of `ans2` will be '10' repeated `n` times. 
Output State: **`L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^5, `A` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^100000, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `ans1` is a string of all '9's, `ans2` is '10' repeated `n` times**
