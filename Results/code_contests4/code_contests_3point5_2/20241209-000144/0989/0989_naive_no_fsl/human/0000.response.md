Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the input values for the period length `n` and the integer `s`.
2. It then checks if the length of `s` is divisible by `n`, if not, it constructs the smallest periodic number that is greater than `s`.
3. If the first `n` digits of `s` are all 9's, it constructs the periodic number accordingly.
4. If the first `n` digits of `s` are not all 9's, it finds the next smallest periodic number that is greater than `s`.
5. The program follows the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases.

Therefore, based on the logic implemented and the provided examples, the program is correct.
