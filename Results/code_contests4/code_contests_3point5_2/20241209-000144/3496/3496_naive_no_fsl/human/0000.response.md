Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input string and iterates through each character.
2. It maintains a list called `hand` to store the objects Polycarpus is currently carrying.
3. If the hand is empty, it adds the current object to the hand.
4. If the current object is the same as the last object in hand and the number of objects in hand is less than 5, it adds the current object to the hand.
5. If the current object is different from the last object in hand or the number of objects in hand is equal to 5, it increments the count and resets the hand with the current object.
6. Finally, it prints the count plus 1 if there are objects still left in hand.
7. The program correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that Polycarpus cannot carry objects of two different types simultaneously and that he cannot carry more than 5 items at a time.
