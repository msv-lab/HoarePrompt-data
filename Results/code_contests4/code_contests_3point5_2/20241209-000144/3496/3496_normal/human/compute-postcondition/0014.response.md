Postcondition: ***`str` is a non-empty string consisting of only "C" and "P", `n` is the length of the string, `count` is 0 initially. If hand is empty, then it contains only one element `str[i]` and its length is 1. If hand is not empty, and str[i] is equal to the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `count` remains 0 and `hand` has a length less than 5. Otherwise, `count` becomes 1 and `hand` contains only the element `str[i]`.***
