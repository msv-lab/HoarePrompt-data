Postcondition: ***`str` is a non-empty string consisting of only "C" and "P", `n` is the length of the string, `hand` is either empty or contains elements from `str` with a maximum length of 5. If `hand` was empty, the length of `hand` is increased by 1. If `hand` was not empty, `str[i]` is equal to the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, then `hand` is appended with `str[i]`. Otherwise, if the conditions are not met, `hand` is a list containing the first character of `str` and the count variable is incremented by 1.***
