Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the length of the string `str`, which consists of only the letters "C" and "P". The length of the string will determine the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `str` is a string consisting of only the letters "C" and "P", `n` is the length of the string.
Output State: **`str` is a string consisting of only the letters "C" and "P", `n` is the length of the string**
