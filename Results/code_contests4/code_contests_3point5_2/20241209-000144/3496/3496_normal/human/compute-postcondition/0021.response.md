Postcondition: ***`str` is a non-empty string consisting of only "C" and "P", `n` is the length of the string. If `hand` is empty, after execution, the length of `hand` is increased by 1. If `hand` is not empty, if `str[i]` is equal to the last element of `hand` and the length of `hand` is less than 5, `count` remains unchanged and `hand` contains the characters appended from `str`. Otherwise, `count` is updated by 1 and `hand` is updated with the value of `str[i]`.***
