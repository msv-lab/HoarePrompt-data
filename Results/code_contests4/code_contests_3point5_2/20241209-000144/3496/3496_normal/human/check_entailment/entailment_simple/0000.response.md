Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the input string, keeping track of the current consecutive objects in `hand`. If the next object can be added to `hand` (same type and less than 5 objects already in `hand`), it is added. If not, the count of visits to the closet is incremented, and a new `hand` list is started with the current object.

The program ensures that Polycarpus does not carry more than 5 items at a time and only carries objects of the same type in a single trip to the closet. The final count of visits to the closet is correctly calculated and printed.
