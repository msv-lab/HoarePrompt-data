You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarpus has postcards and photos hung in a row on the wall. He decided to put them away to the closet and hang on the wall a famous painter's picture. Polycarpus does it like that: he goes from the left to the right and removes the objects consecutively. As Polycarpus doesn't want any mix-ups to happen, he will not carry in his hands objects of two different types. In other words, Polycarpus can't carry both postcards and photos simultaneously. Sometimes he goes to the closet and puts the objects there, thus leaving his hands free. Polycarpus must put all the postcards and photos to the closet. He cannot skip objects. What minimum number of times he should visit the closet if he cannot carry more than 5 items?

Input

The only line of the input data contains a non-empty string consisting of letters "С" and "P" whose length does not exceed 100 characters. If the i-th character in the string is the letter "С", that means that the i-th object (the numbering goes from the left to the right) on Polycarpus' wall is a postcard. And if the i-th character is the letter "P", than the i-th object on the wall is a photo.

Output

Print the only number — the minimum number of times Polycarpus has to visit the closet.

Note

In the first sample Polycarpus needs to take one item to the closet 7 times.

In the second sample Polycarpus can first take 3 postcards to the closet; then 3 more. He can take the 6 photos that are left in the similar way, going to the closet twice.

In the third sample Polycarpus can visit the closet twice, both times carrying 3 postcards. Then he can take there 2 photos at once, then one postcard and finally, he can carry the last 10 photos if he visits the closet twice.

In the fourth sample Polycarpus can visit the closet twice and take there all 10 postcards (5 items during each go).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input string consists of only the letters "C" and "P". The length of the string does not exceed 100 characters.
def func():
    str = raw_input()
    n = len(str)
    count = 0
    hand = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if hand.__len__() == 0:
            hand.append(str[i])
        elif str[i] == hand[-1] and hand.__len__() < 5:
            hand.append(str[i])
        else:
            count = count + 1
            hand = [str[i]]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `str` is a non-empty string consisting of only "C" and "P", `n` is the length of the string, `count` is the number of times a character changed in `hand` from "C" to "P" or vice versa, and `hand` is a list containing consecutive characters from `str` with a maximum length of 5.
    print(count + (hand.__len__() != 0))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
