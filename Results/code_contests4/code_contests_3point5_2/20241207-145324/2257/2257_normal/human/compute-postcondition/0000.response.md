Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. Since the input is not specified, the specific values of `n` and `m` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100. The names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100. The names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32.**
