According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `counts`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `counts` is a sorted list with a length greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, the price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100, the names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32, `buy` contains the count of each fruit purchased, `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary, `counts` is a sorted list of values from the `buy` dictionary with a length greater than `i + 2`, `maxi` is updated, `mini` is updated based on the calculation `mini += cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]`, `i` is 1, `maxi` is updated based on the calculation `maxi += cs[-i - 1] * counts[-i - 1`, `mini` is updated based on the calculation `mini += cs[i] * counts[-i - 1]**
