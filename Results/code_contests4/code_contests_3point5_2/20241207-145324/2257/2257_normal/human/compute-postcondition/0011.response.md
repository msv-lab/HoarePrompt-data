Example Answer:
`buy[nf]` is updated to contain one more count of the fruit `nf`. If `nf` was not present in `buy`, it is added with a count of 1. The variables `n`, `m`, `price`, and the other fruits in the dictionary are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100, the price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100, the names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32; `buy` contains the count of each fruit purchased, `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be incremented by 1 and `buy[nf]` is updated to contain one more count of the fruit `nf`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100, the price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100, the names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32; `buy` contains the count of each fruit purchased, `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be incremented by 1 and `buy[nf]` is updated to contain one more count of the fruit `nf`**
