Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the values of `mini` and `maxi` using string formatting. The values of `mini` and `maxi` are already calculated and stored in the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxi` contains the sum of the product of the highest counts and their corresponding prices, `mini` contains the sum of the product of the lowest counts and their corresponding prices.
Output State: **`maxi` contains the sum of the product of the highest counts and their corresponding prices, `mini` contains the sum of the product of the lowest counts and their corresponding prices**
