Example Answer:
The variable `mini` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100, the price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100, the names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32; `buy` is a dictionary containing the count of each fruit purchased, `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary, `counts` is a sorted list of values from the `buy` dictionary, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100, the price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100, the names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32; `buy` is a dictionary containing the count of each fruit purchased, `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary, `counts` is a sorted list of values from the `buy` dictionary, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is 0**
