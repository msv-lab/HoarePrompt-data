Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and then sorted in ascending order. The initial state does not provide specific values for `n` and `m`, so the output state will be: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100. The names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100. The names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32.**
