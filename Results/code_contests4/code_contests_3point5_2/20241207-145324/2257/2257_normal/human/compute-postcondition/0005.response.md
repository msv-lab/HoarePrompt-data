Example Answer:
`buy[nf]` is updated by incrementing its current value by 1 or initializing it to 1 if it doesn't exist. The value of `nf` is the input string, and the dictionary `buy` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, the price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100, the names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32; `buy` is a dictionary containing the count of each fruit purchased, and `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary.
