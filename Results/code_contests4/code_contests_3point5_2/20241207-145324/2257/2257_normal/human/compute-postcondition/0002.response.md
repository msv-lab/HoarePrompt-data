Example Answer:
`buy` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100. The names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32; `buy` is an empty dictionary.
