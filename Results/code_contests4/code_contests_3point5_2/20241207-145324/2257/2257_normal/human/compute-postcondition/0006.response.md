According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, the price of each fruit is a positive integer not exceeding 100, the names of the fruits are non-empty strings of small Latin letters with a length not exceeding 32; `buy` is a dictionary containing the count of each fruit purchased, and `nf` is the last input string added to the dictionary, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be incremented by 1**
