Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly takes the input values for the number of price tags and items in Valera's list.
- It then reads the prices of each fruit and the names of the fruits Valera wants to buy.
- It calculates the minimum and maximum possible sum based on the prices and the count of each fruit Valera wants to buy.
- The program sorts the prices in ascending order and the count of each fruit in descending order to calculate the minimum and maximum sum accurately.
- Finally, it prints the minimum and maximum possible sum that Valera may need to buy all fruits from his list.
- The program seems to handle all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
