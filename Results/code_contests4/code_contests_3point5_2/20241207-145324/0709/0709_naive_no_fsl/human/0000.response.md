Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner. It sorts the number of balloons in ascending order, then assigns the smallest number to the variable `t`. It then calculates the remaining balloons after using the smallest number and adds additional tables based on the remaining green and blue balloons. The logic checks for different scenarios where additional tables can be added based on the remaining balloons. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
