Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input of red, green, and blue balloons, sorts them in ascending order to determine the minimum number of tables that can be decorated with each color, calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated based on the constraints provided, and then prints the output. The logic in the program ensures that each table has balloons of different colors and that the maximum number of tables are decorated.
