Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with the given number of red, green, and blue balloons. The program sorts the input values, assigns the red balloons to the tables, and then distributes the remaining green and blue balloons to maximize the number of tables. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description, and the annotations provide insight into the state of the program before and after each function call. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. Hence, the code is correct for all potential cases.
