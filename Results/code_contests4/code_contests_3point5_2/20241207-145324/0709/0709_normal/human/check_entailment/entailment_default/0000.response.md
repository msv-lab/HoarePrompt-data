Initial Assessment: The program seems to take three integers as input representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons. It then calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner, where each table should have exactly three balloons with different colors. The code appears to correctly implement the logic based on the problem description.

Checking with Output Hints: The output hints do not provide any additional edge cases that the code might not handle. They simply describe the purpose of the two functions provided. The functions seem to work correctly based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of tables that can be decorated with the given number of red, green, and blue balloons as per the problem description. The code handles all potential cases where the conditions for decorating a table with different colored balloons are met. Since the examples provided also work correctly, we can conclude that the code is correct.
