Example Answer:
The `file.write(str(x))` function writes the string representation of `x` to the file. If `at_start` is False, it means the file has been written with the string representation of `x`. If `at_start` is True, there is no change in the state of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: at_start is a boolean, file has been written with the string representation of `x`.
Output State: **at_start is a boolean, file has been written with the string representation of `x`**
