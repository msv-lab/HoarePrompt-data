Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and operates without any input values. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writes their string representations to the output file defined by `kwargs`, and separates them by the specified separator. If provided, it writes the specified end value at the end. If the `flush` key is set to True in `kwargs`, it flushes the output file. The function does not return any specific value.**
