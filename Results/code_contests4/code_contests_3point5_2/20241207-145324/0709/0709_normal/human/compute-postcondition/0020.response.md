Example Answer: 
The 'end' value is popped from kwargs and written to the file. If 'end' exists in kwargs, it is written, otherwise '\n' is written. The variable at_start remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: at_start is False, file has been written with the string representation of all elements in args and the value of 'end'.
Output State: **at_start is False, file has been written with the string representation of all elements in args and the value of 'end'**
