Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The states of `r`, `g`, and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`r`, `g`, and `b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9, `at_start` is True**
