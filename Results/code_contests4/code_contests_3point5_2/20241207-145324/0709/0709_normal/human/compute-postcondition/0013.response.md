Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value. The file has been written with the string representation of `x`, but the value of `x` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: at_start is False, file has been written with the string representation of `x`.
Output State: **at_start is False, file has been written with the string representation of `x`**
