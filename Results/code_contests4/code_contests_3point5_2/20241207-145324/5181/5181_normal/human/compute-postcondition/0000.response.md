Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values parsed from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input**
