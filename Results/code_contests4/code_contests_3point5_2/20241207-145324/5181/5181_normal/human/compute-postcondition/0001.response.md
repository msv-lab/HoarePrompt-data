Example Answer: 
The code snippet calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, then adds 2 times the value of `c`. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input, the sum of `a` and `b` is calculated, and then 2 times the value of `c` is added.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input, the sum of `a` and `b` is calculated, and then 2 times the value of `c` is added**
