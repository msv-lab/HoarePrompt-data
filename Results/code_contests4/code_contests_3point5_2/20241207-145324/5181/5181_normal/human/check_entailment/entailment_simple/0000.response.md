Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem asks for finding the maximum length of a good string that can be obtained by concatenating the given strings "a", "b", and "ab" in any order. However, the program simply adds "a" and "b" and then adds 2 times "c", which does not accurately reflect the logic needed to solve the problem.

The correct approach should involve considering all possible combinations of the given strings to form a good string. The length of the good string will depend on the number of "a", "b", and "ab" strings available and how they can be combined to maximize the length.
