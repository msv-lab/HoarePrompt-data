Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the good string as described in the problem description. The program simply adds the values of `a` and `b`, and then adds twice the value of `c`, which does not represent the correct logic for finding the maximum length of the good string. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
