#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(a + b) + 2 * c
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three integers from the input, performs an arithmetic operation of adding the first two integers and adding twice the third integer, but it does not correctly print the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
