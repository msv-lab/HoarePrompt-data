Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

For example, if we take the input (2, 1, 2) where a = 2, b = 1, and c = 2, the expected output should be 7. However, the program will output 5 instead of 7. This is because the program does not correctly handle the concatenation of both 'ab' strings. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness should be **False**.
