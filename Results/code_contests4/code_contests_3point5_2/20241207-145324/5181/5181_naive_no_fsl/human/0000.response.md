Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible length of the good string that can be obtained by choosing a subset of the given strings "a", "b", and "ab" and concatenating them in any arbitrarily order. The program simply adds the values of "a" and "b" and then adds twice the value of "c" to get the final result. This logic is correct for all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately. 

Additionally, the program is efficient as it directly calculates the maximum length without the need for any complex conditional statements or loops. Hence, based on the problem description and the given program, we can conclude that the program is correct for all cases.
