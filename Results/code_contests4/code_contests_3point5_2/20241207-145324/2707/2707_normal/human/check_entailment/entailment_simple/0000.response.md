Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the sum of the wealth values for the residents of the two cities in such a way that the sum of arithmetic means of wealth of people in each of the cities is maximized. This is achieved by sorting the wealth values in ascending order and then selecting the residents for each city accordingly. The arithmetic means are calculated as specified in the problem description. The program outputs the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth of cities' residents. It does so for every potential case as it considers all possible combinations of residents for the two cities.
