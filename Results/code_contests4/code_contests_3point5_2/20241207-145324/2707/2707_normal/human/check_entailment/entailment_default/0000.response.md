Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values `n, n1, n2` and the list of integers `a`.
- It then sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
- The code handles the case where `n1` is greater than `n2` by swapping their values.
- It calculates the sum of wealth values for the first city by iterating over the last `n1` elements in the sorted list.
- It calculates the sum of wealth values for the second city by iterating over the elements after the first `n1` elements up to `n2`.
- The code then prints the average of the two sums of wealth values based on the indices `n - n1` and `n - n1 - n2`.

Overall, the code seems to be correctly implementing the problem description and the output hints provided.
