Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It reads the input values `n, n1, n2` and a list of integers `a`, sorts the wealth values in ascending order, calculates the sum of wealth values for the first city (`s1`) and the sum of wealth values for the second city (`s2`) based on the indices `n - n1` and `n - n1 - n2` respectively, and then prints the average of the two sums. The program ensures that the arithmetic mean of wealth of people in each city is maximized by selecting the appropriate subsets of candidates for each city. The swapping of `n1` and `n2` values if `n1` is greater is done to ensure consistency in the calculations. Overall, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
