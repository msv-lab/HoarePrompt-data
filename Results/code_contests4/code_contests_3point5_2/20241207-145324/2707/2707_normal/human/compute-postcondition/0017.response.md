According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n2`. If `i` is less than `n2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers satisfying 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `s2` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `i` is incremented in each iteration of the loop. 

So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `s2` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration**.
