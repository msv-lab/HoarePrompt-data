According to the code, the loop will execute n1 times. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n1` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0**
