Example Answer:
`s2` is incremented by the value of `a[n - n1 - i - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `s2` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `s2` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration**
