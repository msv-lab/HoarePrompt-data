Output State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a`, `s2` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - n1`) to the last position in the list `a` plus the sum of the wealth values at positions (`n - n1 - 1`) to (`n - n1 - n2`), the result of the expression `1.0 * s1 / n1 + 1.0 * s2 / n2` is printed.**
