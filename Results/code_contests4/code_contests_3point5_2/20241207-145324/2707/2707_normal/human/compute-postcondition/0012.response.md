Output State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - i - 1`) to (`n - i`), `n1` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s1` is updated by adding the value at index `n - i - 1` from list `a`.**
