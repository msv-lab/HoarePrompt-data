Example Answer: 
The list `a` is assigned the integer values extracted from the input using `raw_input().split()`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n, n1, and n2 are integers such that 1 <= n, n1, n2 <= 100,000 and n1 + n2 <= n, the list `a` contains the wealth values extracted from the input.
Output State: **n, n1, and n2 are integers such that 1 <= n, n1, n2 <= 100,000 and n1 + n2 <= n, the list `a` contains the wealth values extracted from the input**
