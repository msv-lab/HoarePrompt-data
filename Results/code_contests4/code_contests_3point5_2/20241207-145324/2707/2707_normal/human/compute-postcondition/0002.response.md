Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The wealth values in the list are now arranged from the smallest to the largest. The values of `n`, `n1`, and `n2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n, n1, and n2 are integers such that 1 <= n, n1, n2 <= 100,000 and n1 + n2 <= n, the list `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **n, n1, and n2 are integers such that 1 <= n, n1, n2 <= 100,000 and n1 + n2 <= n, the list `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order.**
