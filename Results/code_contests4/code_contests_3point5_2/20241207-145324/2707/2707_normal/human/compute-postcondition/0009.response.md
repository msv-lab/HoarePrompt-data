According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n1`. If `i` is less than `n1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - i - 1`) to (`n - i`), for the loop to execute the first time `n1` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. 
So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - i - 1`) to (`n - i`), for the loop to execute the second time `n1` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1**
