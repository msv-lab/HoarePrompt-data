Output State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `n1`, `n2` <= 100,000 and `n1` + `n2` <= `n`, `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order, `s1` is the sum of wealth values from position (`n - i - 1`) to (`n - i`), for the loop to execute the first time `n1` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0**
