Example Answer:
The values of `n1` and `n2` are swapped, so `n1` now holds the previous value of `n2` and `n2` holds the previous value of `n1`. Since the values of `n1` and `n2` are integers within the given range, the Output State is: `n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= n, n1, n2 <= 100,000 and n1 + n2 <= n, the list `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order. Additionally, after entering the if condition (n1 > n2) holds true, `n1` and `n2` have been swapped.
Output State: **`n`, `n1`, `n2` are integers such that 1 <= n, n1, n2 <= 100,000 and n1 + n2 <= n, the list `a` contains the wealth values sorted in ascending order. Additionally, after entering the if condition (n1 > n2) holds true, `n1` and `n2` have been swapped**
