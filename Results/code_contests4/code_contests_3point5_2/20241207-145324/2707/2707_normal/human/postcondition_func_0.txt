The function `func` reads input values `n, n1, n2` and a list of integers `a` and calculates the average of two sums of wealth values based on the indices `n - n1` and `n - n1 - n2`. The function does not return any specific value. If `n1` is greater than `n2`, the function swaps their values before performing the calculations.
