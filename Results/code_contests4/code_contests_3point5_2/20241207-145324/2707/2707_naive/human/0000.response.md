Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the sum of n1 and n2 is less than n. For example, if n = 5, n1 = 1, and n2 = 1, and the wealth values are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program will not output the correct result. In this case, the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth of cities' residents would be achieved by selecting residents with wealth values [5, 4] for the first city and [3] for the second city, resulting in an output of 5.33333333. Hence, the program fails to handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
