Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of candidates, the planned number of residents for each city, and the wealth of each candidate.
2. It sorts the wealth values in ascending order.
3. It then calculates the sum of the wealthiest n1 candidates for the first city and the sum of the wealthiest n2 candidates for the second city.
4. Finally, it calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of arithmetic means of wealth of cities' residents according to the given formula.
5. The program handles all potential cases by considering both n1 and n2 in the correct order based on their values.
6. The program uses the correct arithmetic calculations to find the maximum possible sum, ensuring that the output meets the specified precision requirements.
