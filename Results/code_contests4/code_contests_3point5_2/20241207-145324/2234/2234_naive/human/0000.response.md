Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly reorder the strings as per the problem description. The program only checks if a string is a substring of another string but does not consider the order in which the strings should be reordered. This can lead to cases where the strings are not reordered in such a way that all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
a
aa
aaa
```
The program will output "YES" and reorder the strings as:
```
aaa
aa
a
```
However, this is incorrect as "aaa" is not a substring of "aa" and "a" is not a substring of "aa".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases, making the Correctness **False**.
