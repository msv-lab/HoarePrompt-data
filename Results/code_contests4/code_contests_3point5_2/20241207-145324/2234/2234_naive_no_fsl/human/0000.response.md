Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only checks if a string is a substring of another string within the given list of strings, but it does not rearrange the strings in the required order. The logic in the program is not aligned with the problem description. 

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3
qwerty
qwerty
qwerty

Output:
NO

The program will output "NO" in this case, but according to the problem description, the strings can be reordered in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. So the correct output should be "YES" with the strings in the same order as the input.
