Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 1 value, `z` is not the last value in `ls`, `a` is assigned the value of the last raw input, `count` is incremented by 1, `x` is in `z`.
Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` contains at least 1 value, `z` is not the last value in `ls`, `a` is assigned the value of the last raw input, `count` is incremented by 1, `x` is in `z`**
