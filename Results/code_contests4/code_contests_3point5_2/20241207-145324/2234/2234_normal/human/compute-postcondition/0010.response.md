According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be greater than 1. Additionally, `ls` contains the value of `a` and `a` is assigned the value of the raw input, and it must have appended the value of `a`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1, `ls` has appended the value of `a`**
