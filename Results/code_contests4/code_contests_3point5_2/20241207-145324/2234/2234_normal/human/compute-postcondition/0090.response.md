According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `c1`. If `z` is less than `c1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 2 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+1`, `x[0]` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `z` must be less than `c1+1`.
State: **Output State: All characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 2 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+1`, `x[0]` is printed, for the loop to execute a second time `z` must be less than `c1+1`**
