According to the code, the loop will execute `c1` number of times. Since `c1` is the count of the first item in `sorted_x`, it implies that the list `sorted_x` must have at least 1 item. Therefore, the loop will execute if `sorted_x` is not empty. Additionally, for the loop to execute the first time, `z` should be 0.
State: **`sorted_x` contains items, `c2` is less than or equal to 1, 'YES' is printed, `x` is the first item in `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the first item in `sorted_x`, for the loop to execute the first time `z` is 0**
