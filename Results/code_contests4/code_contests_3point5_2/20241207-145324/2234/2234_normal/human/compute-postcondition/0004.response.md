Example Answer:
`a` is appended to the list `ls`, and `ls` is an empty list, so after execution, `ls` will contain only the value of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `ls` contains the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `ls` contains the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input**
