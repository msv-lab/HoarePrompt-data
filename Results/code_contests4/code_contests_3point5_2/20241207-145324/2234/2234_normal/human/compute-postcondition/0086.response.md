According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `sorted_x`. If there are more items in `sorted_x`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, all characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed c1 times. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more item in `sorted_x`.
State: **All characters of the first item in sorted_x are printed c1 times, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more item in sorted_x**
