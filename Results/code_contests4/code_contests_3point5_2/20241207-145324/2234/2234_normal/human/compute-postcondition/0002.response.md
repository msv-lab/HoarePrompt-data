According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer, so it can be assumed that `t` can be any positive integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an input integer, `ls` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `t` must be greater than 0**
