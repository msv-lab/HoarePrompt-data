Postcondition: ***`sorted_x` contains the items of `dict1` sorted based on the values in descending order, `c2` is the number of items in `sorted_x` where the second element of the item is equal to 1. If `c2` is greater than 1, the original state is maintained. Otherwise, all characters of all items in `sorted_x` are printed according to their count in `ls`, `sorted_x` has `c1+1` items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+2`, `c1` is assigned the count of `x[0]` in `ls`, and `z` is 0.***
