According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are items in `sorted_x`. However, the condition `c2` is less than or equal to 1 and 'YES' is printed does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, to guarantee the loop execution, the state needs to be adjusted to `sorted_x` contains items, `c2` is less than or equal to 1, 'YES' is printed, and x is the first item in `sorted_x`.
State: **`sorted_x` contains items, `c2` is less than or equal to 1, 'YES' is printed, x is the first item in `sorted_x` for the loop to execute the first time**
