Example Answer:
`c1` is assigned the count of the first item in `sorted_x` in the list `ls`. The value of `x` is the first item in `sorted_x`, and `c2` is less than or equal to 1. The output state is: `sorted_x` contains items, `c2` is less than or equal to 1, 'YES' is printed, `x` is the first item in `sorted_x` for the loop to execute the first time, `c1` is the count of the first item in `sorted_x`.
Output State: **`sorted_x` contains items, `c2` is less than or equal to 1, 'YES' is printed, `x` is the first item in `sorted_x` for the loop to execute the first time, `c1` is the count of the first item in `sorted_x`**
