According to the code, the loop will execute `c1` times. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more item in `sorted_x`. Before the loop starts, all characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1` times, so the state needs to be adjusted to `sorted_x` has at least 2 items, and the count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+1`.
State: **All characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 2 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+1`**
