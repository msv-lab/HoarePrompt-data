According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are items in the sorted_x. Before the loop starts, sorted_x contains items sorted based on the values in descending order from dict1, so it is not necessary to adjust this state. However, c2 is assigned the value 0, which does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`sorted_x` contains the items of `dict1` sorted based on the values in descending order, `c2` is assigned the value 0**
