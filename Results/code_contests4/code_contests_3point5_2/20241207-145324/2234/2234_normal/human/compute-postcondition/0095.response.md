According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_x` list. If the list has at least 3 items, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, all characters of the first item in `sorted_x` were printed `c1+1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 2 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+2`, and `x[0]` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `sorted_x` must have at least 3 items.
State: **All characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1+1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 3 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+2`, `x[0]` is printed.**
