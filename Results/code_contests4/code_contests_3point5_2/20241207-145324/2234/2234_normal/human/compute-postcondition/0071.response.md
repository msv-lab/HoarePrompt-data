Postcondition: ***`sorted_x` contains the items of `dict1` sorted based on the values in descending order, `c2` is assigned the value 3, the value of `item[1]` is different from 1, and there are more items in `sorted_x` that have not been iterated over yet. If `item[1]` is 1, the value of `c2` changes to 2, and the remaining conditions remain the same.***
