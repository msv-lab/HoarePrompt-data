Example Answer:
`ls` appends the value of `a`, which is the raw input. The initial state mentions that `ls` contains the value of `a`, so after execution, `ls` will now contain two instances of the value of `a`. The loop condition `t` being greater than 1 is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains two instances of the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains two instances of the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input**
