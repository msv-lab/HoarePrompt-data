Example Answer:
`t` is decreased by 1, so the value of `t` is reduced by 1 from the initial input. The values of `ls` and `a` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer decreased by 2, `ls` contains two instances of the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer decreased by 2, `ls` contains two instances of the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input**
