Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from the user as input. Then, it reads `t` strings and stores them in a list `ls`. After that, it creates a dictionary `dict1` where the keys are the strings from `ls` and the values represent how many times each string appears in `ls`. The function then sorts `dict1` based on the values in descending order and checks if there is more than one item with a count of 1. If there is, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. Additionally, it prints out the characters based on their count in the sorted dictionary. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the output based on the described conditions.**
