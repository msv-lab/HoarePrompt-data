Example Answer:
No variables are affected by the creation of an empty dictionary `dict1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `ls` contains all the values of `a` inputted during the loop iterations, `a` is assigned the value of the last raw input.
Output State: **`t` is 0, `ls` contains all the values of `a` inputted during the loop iterations, `a` is assigned the value of the last raw input**
