Example Answer:
`t` is decreased by 1, where `t` was initially an input integer. The loop will execute again only if `t` is greater than 1. `ls` contains the value of `a`, and `a` is assigned the value of the raw input, which means the value of `a` depends on the user input. `ls` appends the value of `a`. 
Output State: **`t` is an input integer decreased by 1, `ls` contains the value of `a`, `a` is assigned the value of the raw input, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1, `ls` has appended the value of `a`**
