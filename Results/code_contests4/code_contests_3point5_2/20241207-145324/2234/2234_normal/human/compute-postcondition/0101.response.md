According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `c1`. If `c1` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1+1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 3 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+2`, `c1` is assigned the count of `x[0]` in `ls`, `z` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `c1` must be greater than 2.
State: **All characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1+1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 3 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+2`, `c1` is assigned the count of `x[0]` in `ls`, for the loop to execute again `c1` is greater than 2, `z` is 0**
