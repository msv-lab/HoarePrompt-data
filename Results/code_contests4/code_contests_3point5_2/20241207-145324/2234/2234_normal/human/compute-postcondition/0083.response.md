According to the code, the loop can execute again if `z` is less than `c1`. At the end of the last iteration, `sorted_x` contains items, `c2` is less than or equal to 1, 'YES' is printed, `x` is the first item in `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the first item in `sorted_x`, for the loop to execute the second time `z` is 1, the first character of `x` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `z` should be 2.
State: **`sorted_x` contains items, `c2` is less than or equal to 1, 'YES' is printed, `x` is the first item in `sorted_x`, `c1` is the count of the first item in `sorted_x`, for the loop to execute the third time `z` is 2, the second character of `x` is printed**
