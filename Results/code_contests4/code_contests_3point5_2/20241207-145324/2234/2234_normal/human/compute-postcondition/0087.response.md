Example Answer:
`c1` is assigned the count of the first item in `sorted_x` which is `x[0]`. The value of `c1` depends on the count of `x[0]` in `ls`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1` times, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more item in `sorted_x`; `c1` is the count of `x[0]` in `ls`.
Output State: **All characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1` times, for the loop to execute one more time there must be at least one more item in `sorted_x`; `c1` is the count of `x[0]` in `ls`**
