According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the value of `c1`. At the end of the last iteration, the first item in `sorted_x` has been printed `c1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 2 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+1`, `x[0]` has been printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `z` must be less than `c1+1`, and `c1` must be increased by 1.
State: **Output State: All characters of the first item in `sorted_x` are printed `c1+1` times, `sorted_x` has at least 2 items, count of `x[0]` in `ls` is now `c1+2`, `x[0]` is printed, for the loop to execute a second time `z` must be less than `c1+2**.
