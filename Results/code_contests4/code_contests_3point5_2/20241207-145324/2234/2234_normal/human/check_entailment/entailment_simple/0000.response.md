Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program only checks if a string is a substring of another string and then sorts the strings based on the number of times they appear as substrings in other strings. However, the program does not actually rearrange the strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings. Therefore, the output of the program does not guarantee that the strings are reordered as required by the problem description.
