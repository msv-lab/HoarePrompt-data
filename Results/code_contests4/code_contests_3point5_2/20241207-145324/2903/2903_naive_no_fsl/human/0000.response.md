Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. It does not consider the scenario where frogs can jump on lengths shorter than the maximum jump length. The logic in the program only checks for stones at distances less than the maximum jump length, but it should also consider the case where frogs can use multiple stones to cross the river. 

For example, if the input is:
10 5
0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0

The expected output is 3, as two frogs can use the different stones at distance 5 and one frog can use the stones at distances 3 and then 8. However, the program may not output the correct result for this case.
