According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is less than `n - 1`. If i < k, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `i`. Otherwise, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`.
So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1` and `s` needs to be calculated based on the updated value of `i`.
State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to the current value of `i + 1`. If i < k, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `i`. Otherwise, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`.**
