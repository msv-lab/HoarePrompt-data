Example Answer:
The `print` statement outputs the minimum value between `mn` and `s`, which are the updated variables based on the conditions in the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `s` has been updated based on the conditions in the loop, and `mn` has been updated to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1`.
Output State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `s` has been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `mn` has been updated to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1**.
