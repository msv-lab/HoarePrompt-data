According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is less than `n - 1**.
