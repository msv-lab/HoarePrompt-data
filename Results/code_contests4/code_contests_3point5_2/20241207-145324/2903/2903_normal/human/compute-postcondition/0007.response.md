Example Answer:
The value of `s` is updated by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. The value of `a_i` and `a_{i-k}` can be anywhere between 0 and 10^4. The value of `mn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `mn` and the updated `s`. The value of `i` remains greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k`, `s` have been updated, `mn` has been updated to the minimum value, and `i` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k`, `s` have been updated, `mn` has been updated to the minimum value, and `i` is greater than or equal to `k**.
