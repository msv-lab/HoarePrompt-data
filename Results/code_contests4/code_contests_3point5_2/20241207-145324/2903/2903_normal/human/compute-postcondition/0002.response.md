According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, w and l are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5 does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1, `w` and `l` maintain their given constraints, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, k, s, mn remain the same.
State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k`, `s`, `mn` remain the same**
