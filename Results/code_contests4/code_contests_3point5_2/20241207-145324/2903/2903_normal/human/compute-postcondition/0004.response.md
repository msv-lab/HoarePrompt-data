Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The previous values of `s` and `a[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k`, `s`, `mn` remain the same. Additionally, `i` is less than `k`.
Output State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k`, `s` updated value, `mn` remain the same. Additionally, `i` is less than `k`.**
