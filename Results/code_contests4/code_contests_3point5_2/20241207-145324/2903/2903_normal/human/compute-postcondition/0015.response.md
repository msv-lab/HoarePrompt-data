Example Answer:
`s` is updated by adding the element at index `i` from list `a`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `s`, `i`, and other variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to the current value of `i + 1`, if i < k, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `i`. Otherwise, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`.
