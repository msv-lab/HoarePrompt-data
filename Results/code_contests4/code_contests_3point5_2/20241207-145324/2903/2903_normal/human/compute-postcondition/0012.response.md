Example Answer:
`s` is updated by adding the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - k]`. The values of `s`, `a[i]`, and `a[i - k]` are dependent on the inputs and the previous modifications made in the program. The value of `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the new value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 1, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`.
Output State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n - 1, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`**
