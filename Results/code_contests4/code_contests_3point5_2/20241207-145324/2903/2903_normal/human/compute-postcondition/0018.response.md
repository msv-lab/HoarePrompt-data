Postcondition: ***`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to the current value of `i + 1`. If i < k, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `i`. Otherwise, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `s`. After the execution of the if else block, the program will have `mn` updated to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if i < k, `s` will be updated to include the new element difference.***
