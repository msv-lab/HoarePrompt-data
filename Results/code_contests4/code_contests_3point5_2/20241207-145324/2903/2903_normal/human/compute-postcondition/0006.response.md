Example Answer:
`mn` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `mn` and `s`. Since `mn` is initially set to a high value, it will be updated to `min(mn, s)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k`, `s` remain the same. `mn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `mn` and `s`. i is greater than or equal to k.**
