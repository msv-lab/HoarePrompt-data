The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn`, along with a list of integers `a`. It then iterates through the list `a`, updating the values of `s` and `mn` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `mn` and `s`. The functionality of the function is to determine the minimum value between the sum of elements in `a` and the calculated `s` value after iterating through the list.
