You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A lot of frogs want to cross a river. A river is w units width, but frogs can only jump l units long, where l < w. Frogs can also jump on lengths shorter than l. but can't jump longer. Hopefully, there are some stones in the river to help them.

The stones are located at integer distances from the banks. There are a_i stones at the distance of i units from the bank the frogs are currently at. Each stone can only be used once by one frog, after that it drowns in the water.

What is the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river, given that then can only jump on the stones?

Input

The first line contains two integers w and l (1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5) — the width of the river and the maximum length of a frog's jump.

The second line contains w - 1 integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{w-1} (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), where a_i is the number of stones at the distance i from the bank the frogs are currently at.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.

Examples

Input

10 5
0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0


Output

3


Input

10 3
1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1


Output

3

Note

In the first sample two frogs can use the different stones at the distance 5, and one frog can use the stones at the distances 3 and then 8.

In the second sample although there are two stones at the distance 5, that does not help. The three paths are: 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 10, 0 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 10, 0 → 1 → 4 → 7 → 10.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w and l are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5. The list of stones a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1} contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.**
def func():
    n, k, s, mn = map(int, raw_input().split() + [0, 10000000000])
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if i < k:
            s += a[i]
        else:
            mn = min(mn, s)
            s += a[i] - a[i - k]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` and `l` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < w ≤ 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{w-1}` contains integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1. `s` has been updated based on the conditions in the loop. `mn` has been updated to the minimum value between its current value and the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1`.
    print(min(mn, s))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
