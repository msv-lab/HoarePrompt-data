Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input values for the width of the river, maximum length of a frog's jump, the list of stones, and then iterates through the stones to update the values of `s` and `mn` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `mn` and `s`, which corresponds to the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river using the stones.

The program considers the constraints mentioned in the problem description and correctly calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river based on the available stones. Hence, the program is correct.
