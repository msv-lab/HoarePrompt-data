Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the width of the river, maximum length of a frog's jump, and the number of stones at each distance from the bank. It then iterates through the list of stones and calculates the sum of stones within a distance less than the maximum jump length `l`. If the index `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, it updates the minimum value `mn` with the current sum `s` and subtracts the stones that are no longer within the range of the frog's jump.

Finally, it prints the minimum value between `mn` and the final sum `s`, which represents the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river using the stones.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river using the provided stones and jump constraints.
