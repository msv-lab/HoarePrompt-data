Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, `s`, and `mn`, along with a list of integers `a`.
- It then iterates through the list `a`, updating the values of `s` and `mn` based on certain conditions.
- Finally, it prints the minimum value between `mn` and `s`, which is the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints provided also agree with the functionality of the code.
