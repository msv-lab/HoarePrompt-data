#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N). r_i are integers representing towns visited by Joisino. A_i, B_i are integers representing towns connected by roads. C_i are integers representing the length of roads.**
def func():
    f = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))
    N, M, R = f()
    r = f()
    a, b, c = zip(*map(f, [0] * M))
    a = csgraph.dijkstra(csr_matrix((c, (a, b)), [N + 1] * 2), 0, r)
    print(int(min(sum(a[e[i]][r[e[i + 1]]] for i in range(R - 1)) for e in
    __import__('itertools').permutations(range(R)))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input data related to towns, roads, and visits by Joisino. It then calculates the shortest path between towns and returns certain information based on the input data. The code snippet provided is incomplete, as it lacks some necessary imports and variable assignments. Additionally, it does not handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during execution.
