Example Answer:
The function `f()` is called M times with an argument of 0, and the results are unpacked into variables a, b, and c using zip and map functions. The values of a, b, and c depend on the return value of the function f(). Since the specific implementation of f() is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of a, b, and c. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N), r is the return value of the function f().
Output State: **N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N), r is the return value of the function f()**
