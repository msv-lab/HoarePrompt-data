Example Answer:
The lambda function `f` is defined to take input, split it, and convert each element to an integer, returning a list of integers. The variables N, M, R, r_i, A_i, B_i, and C_i are not directly affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N). r_i are integers representing towns visited by Joisino. A_i, B_i are integers representing towns connected by roads. C_i are integers representing the length of roads.**
