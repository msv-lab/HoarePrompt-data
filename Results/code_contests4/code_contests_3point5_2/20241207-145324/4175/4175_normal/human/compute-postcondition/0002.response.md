Example Answer:
The function f() is called and the return value is assigned to variable r. The values of N, M, and R are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N), r is the return value of the function f().
Output State: **N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N), r is the return value of the function f()**
