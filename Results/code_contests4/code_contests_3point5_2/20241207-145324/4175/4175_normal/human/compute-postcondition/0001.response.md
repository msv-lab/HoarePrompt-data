Example Answer:
`N`, `M`, and `R` are assigned the values returned by the function `f()`. The function `f()` returns three integers, so `N`, `M`, and `R` will hold those integer values. The initial conditions for the variables are specified so the output state is: N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N).
Output State: **N, M, R are integers such that 2 <= N <= 200, 1 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2, 2 <= R <= min(8, N)**
