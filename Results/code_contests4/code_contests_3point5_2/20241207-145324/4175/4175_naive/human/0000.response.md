Correctness: **False**

The given Python program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input values are not provided from the standard input as mentioned in the problem description. The program uses the `input()` function to receive input, while the problem states that the input is provided in a specific format from Standard Input. This discrepancy makes the program invalid for the problem description.
