Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It generates a set S that satisfies all the given conditions, including the distinct integers from 1 to limit and the sum of values equaling the given target sum. The program calculates the elements of set S based on the lowbit function and sorts them accordingly. The program handles the case where it is impossible to find a suitable set by printing -1. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides a valid solution.
