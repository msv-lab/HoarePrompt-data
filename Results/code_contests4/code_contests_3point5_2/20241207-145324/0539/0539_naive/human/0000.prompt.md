You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house up. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite set of Picks.

Fortunately, Picks remembers something about his set S:

  * its elements were distinct integers from 1 to limit; 
  * the value of <image> was equal to sum; here lowbit(x) equals 2k where k is the position of the first one in the binary representation of x. For example, lowbit(100102) = 102, lowbit(100012) = 12, lowbit(100002) = 100002 (binary representation). 



Can you help Picks and find any set S, that satisfies all the above conditions?

Input

The first line contains two integers: sum, limit (1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 105).

Output

In the first line print an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), denoting the size of S. Then print the elements of set S in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

If it's impossible to find a suitable set, print -1.

Examples

Input

5 5


Output

2
4 5


Input

4 3


Output

3
2 3 1


Input

5 1


Output

-1

Note

In sample test 1: lowbit(4) = 4, lowbit(5) = 1, 4 + 1 = 5.

In sample test 2: lowbit(1) = 1, lowbit(2) = 2, lowbit(3) = 1, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.
Program:
```
(target, n) = map(int, raw_input().split())
A = []
s = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    k = (i & -i) - 1
    if i != 1 and k == i - 1:
        k = int(math.log(i, 2))
    A.append((2 ** k, i))
    s += A[-1][0]
if s < target:
    print(-1)
    exit()
A.sort()
selected = []
for tup in A:
    target -= tup[0]
    selected.append(tup[1])
    if target <= 0:
        break
print(len(selected))
print(' '.join(map(str, selected)))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
