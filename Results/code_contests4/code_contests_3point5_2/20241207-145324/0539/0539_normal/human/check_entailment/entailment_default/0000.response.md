Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for `target` and `n`, then calculates a list `A` where each element is a tuple containing a power of 2 and its corresponding index. 
- It then sorts the list `A` and selects elements from it until the sum of the selected elements is greater than or equal to `target`. 
- The selected indices are printed along with their count.
- If the sum of elements in list `A` is less than `target`, it prints -1 and exits.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case and the output hints agree with the code. 
- The code correctly determines a suitable set `S` that satisfies all the given conditions.
