You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: At the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house up. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite set of Picks.

Fortunately, Picks remembers something about his set S:

  * its elements were distinct integers from 1 to limit; 
  * the value of <image> was equal to sum; here lowbit(x) equals 2k where k is the position of the first one in the binary representation of x. For example, lowbit(100102) = 102, lowbit(100012) = 12, lowbit(100002) = 100002 (binary representation). 



Can you help Picks and find any set S, that satisfies all the above conditions?

Input

The first line contains two integers: sum, limit (1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 105).

Output

In the first line print an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), denoting the size of S. Then print the elements of set S in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

If it's impossible to find a suitable set, print -1.

Examples

Input

5 5


Output

2
4 5


Input

4 3


Output

3
2 3 1


Input

5 1


Output

-1

Note

In sample test 1: lowbit(4) = 4, lowbit(5) = 1, 4 + 1 = 5.

In sample test 2: lowbit(1) = 1, lowbit(2) = 2, lowbit(3) = 1, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sum and limit are integers such that 1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 105.**
def func():
    target, n = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = []
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        k = (i & -i) - 1
        
        if i != 1 and k == i - 1:
            k = int(math.log(i, 2))
        
        A.append((2 ** k, i))
        
        s += A[-1][0]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input; `A` is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of a power of 2 calculated from `i-1` and the corresponding `i`; `s` is the sum of all elements in list `A`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is not equal to 1 and `k` is equal to the integer logarithm base 2 of `i` for each `i` in the list.
    if (s < target) :
        print(-1)
        exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k` are integers. If the sum of elements in list `A` is less than `target`, there is no change in the state as the program exits immediately without affecting any variables.
    A.sort()
    selected = []
    for tup in A:
        target -= tup[0]
        
        selected.append(tup[1])
        
        if target <= 0:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sum`, `limit`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k`, `selected`, `tup`, `target` are integers. The loop has executed at least once with `A` having at least 1 element. If the loop executed fully, `target` is less than or equal to 0, `selected` contains the `tup[1]` values for all tuples until `target` becomes less than or equal to 0. If the loop did not execute, `selected` is an empty list.
    print(len(selected))
    print(' '.join(map(str, selected)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values for `target` and `n`, calculates a list `A` where each element is a tuple containing a power of 2 and its corresponding index, then sorts the list `A` and selects elements from it until the sum of the selected elements is greater than or equal to `target`. The selected indices are printed along with their count. If the sum of elements in list `A` is less than `target`, it prints -1 and exits.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
