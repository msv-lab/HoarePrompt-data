Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It generates a set S that satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem. It calculates the elements of S based on the formula provided and ensures that the sum of the elements does not exceed the given target sum. The program outputs the correct set S if it exists, and -1 if it is impossible to find a suitable set. The program covers all possible cases and provides a valid solution for each case.
