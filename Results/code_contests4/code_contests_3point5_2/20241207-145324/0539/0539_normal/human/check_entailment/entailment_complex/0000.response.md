Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It reads the input values, constructs a list `A` with tuples containing powers of 2 and their corresponding indices, sorts the list, and selects elements from it until their sum is greater than or equal to the target value. The selected indices are then printed as required.

The program ensures that the sum of the selected elements is at least equal to the target value before printing the selected indices. If the sum is less than the target, the program correctly prints -1 and exits.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
