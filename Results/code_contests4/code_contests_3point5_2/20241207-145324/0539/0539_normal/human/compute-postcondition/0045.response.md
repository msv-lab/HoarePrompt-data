Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k`, `selected`, `tup`, `target` are integers. The loop has executed at least once with `A` having at least 1 element. If the loop executed fully, `target` is less than or equal to 0, `selected` contains the `tup[1]` values for all tuples until `target` becomes less than or equal to 0. If the loop did not execute, `selected` is an empty list.**
