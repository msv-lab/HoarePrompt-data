Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `target` and `n`, calculates a list `A` where each element is a tuple containing a power of 2 and its corresponding index, then sorts the list `A` and selects elements from it until the sum of the selected elements is greater than or equal to `target`. The selected indices are printed along with their count. If the sum of elements in list `A` is less than `target`, it prints -1 and exits. **
