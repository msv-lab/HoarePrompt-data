Example Answer:
`target` and `n` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts an input and splits it based on spaces, `int` converts the values to integers, and `map` applies the conversion to all elements. The values entered can be stored in `target` and `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input**
