Example Answer:
The value of `k` is calculated as `(i & -i) - 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `k` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input; `A` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is at least 1.
Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input; `A` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is at least 1**
