Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k`, `tup` remain unchanged. If `target` is less than or equal to 0, `selected` has `tup[1]` appended to it. The loop or if statement breaks out once the target is less than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more tuples in `A`.***
