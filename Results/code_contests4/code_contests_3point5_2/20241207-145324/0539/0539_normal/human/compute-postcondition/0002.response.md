Example Answer:
The value of `s` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `A`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input; `A` is an empty list, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input; `A` is an empty list, `s` is 0**
