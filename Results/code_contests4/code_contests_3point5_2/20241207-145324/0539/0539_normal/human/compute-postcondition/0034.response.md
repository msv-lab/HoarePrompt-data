Postcondition: ***`sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k`, `selected`, `tup` are integers. The loop has executed at least once with `A` having at least 1 element. `tup` is the first element of `A`. `target` is updated based on the subtraction of `tup[0]` and is less than or equal to 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
