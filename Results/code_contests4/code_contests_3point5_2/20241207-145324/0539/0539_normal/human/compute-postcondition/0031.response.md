Example Answer:
The code appends `tup[1]` to the `selected` list. The value of `tup` is the first element of `A`, so `tup[1]` is the second element of the tuple. After execution, the value of `selected` will have `tup[1]` appended to it. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k` are integers, `selected` contains the second element of the tuple `tup`, for the loop to execute the first time `A` has at least 1 element, `tup` is the first element of `A`, `target` is updated based on the subtraction of `tup[0]`.**
