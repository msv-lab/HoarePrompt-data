Example Answer:
The list `A` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `k` are not affected as the program exits immediately if the sum of elements in list `A` is less than `target`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k` are integers.
Output State: **`sum`, `limit`, `target`, `n`, `A`, `s`, `i`, `k` are integers**
