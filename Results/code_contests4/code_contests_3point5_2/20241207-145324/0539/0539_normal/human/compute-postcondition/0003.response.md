According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`sum` and `limit` are integers such that 1 ≤ `sum`, `limit` ≤ 105; `target` and `n` are assigned values from the input; `A` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is at least 1**
