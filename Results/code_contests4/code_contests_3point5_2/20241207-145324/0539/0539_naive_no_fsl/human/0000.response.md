Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and generates a set S that satisfies all the conditions mentioned. It calculates the necessary elements of the set S and ensures that the sum of those elements equals the given target value. The program also handles cases where it is impossible to find a suitable set by outputting -1. Overall, the program logic is sound and it produces the correct output for the given inputs.
