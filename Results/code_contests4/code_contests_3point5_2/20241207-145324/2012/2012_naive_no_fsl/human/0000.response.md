Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads two very long integers a and b as strings, eliminating any leading zeroes in both numbers. It then compares the lengths of the two numbers and returns the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", "=") based on the comparison of the numbers. The comparison is done character by character, ensuring that the program correctly determines which number is greater or if they are equal. The program also handles cases where one number has leading zeroes while the other does not. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
