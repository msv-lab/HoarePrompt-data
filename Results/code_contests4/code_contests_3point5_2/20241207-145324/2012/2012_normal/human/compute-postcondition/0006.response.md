According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `alen`, and `blen`. If `i` is less than `alen` and `j` is less than `blen`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `alen` is not greater than `blen`, `i` and `j` are integers such that 0 <= i, j <= len(a) = len(b). To execute the loop one more time, the conditions need to be adjusted such that `i` is less than alen and `j` is less than blen. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. i and j are integers such that 0 <= i, j <= len(a) = len(b), alen is not greater than blen. For the loop to execute the first time, i is less than alen and j is less than blen**
