Example Answer: 
`j` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. i and j are integers such that 0 <= i, j <= len(a) = len(b), alen is not greater than blen. For the loop to execute the first time, i is less than alen and j is less than blen. The condition (a[i] >= b[j]) is true. Additionally, a[i] is not greater than b[j], `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1.
