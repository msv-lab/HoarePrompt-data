The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits, and `i` and `j`, which are integers such that 0 <= i, j <= len(a) = len(b). 

After executing the function body, the program returns different characters or strings based on the comparison of the characters at index `i` in string `a` and index `j` in string `b`.

- Case 1: If the character at index `i` in string `a` is greater than the character at index `j` in string `b`, the program returns the character '>'.
- Case 2: If the character at index `i` in string `a` is less than the character at index `j` in string `b`, the program returns the character '<'.
- Case 3: If the character at index `i` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, the program returns the character '='.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to compare characters at specific indices in two given strings and return the corresponding character or string based on the comparison result.
