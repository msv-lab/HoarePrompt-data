Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `allen + 1` and `j` is less than `bllen`. If `a[i]` is less than `b[j]`, the program returns the character '<'. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, the program returns the string '>'. Otherwise, the program does not modify the state.***
