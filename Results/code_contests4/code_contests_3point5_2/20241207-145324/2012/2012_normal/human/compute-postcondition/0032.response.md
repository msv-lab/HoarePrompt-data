Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits, and `i` and `j`, which are integers such that 0 <= i, j <= len(a) = len(b). It compares characters at specific indices in strings `a` and `b` based on the values of `i` and `j`. If the character at index `i` in string `a` is greater than the character at index `j` in string `b`, it returns '>'. If it is less, it returns '<'. If they are equal, it returns '='. The actual code correctly handles these comparisons and returns the corresponding character or string.**
