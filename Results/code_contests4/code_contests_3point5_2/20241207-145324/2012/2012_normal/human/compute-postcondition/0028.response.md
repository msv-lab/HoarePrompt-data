Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `j` and other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `allen + 1` and `j` is less than `bllen`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `allen + 1` and `j` is less than `bllen`.**
