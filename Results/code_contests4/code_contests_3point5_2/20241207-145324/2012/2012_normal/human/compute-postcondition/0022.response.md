According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `allen`, `j`, and `bllen`. If `i` is less than `allen` and `j` is less than `bllen`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` needs to be less than `allen + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `allen + 1` and `j` is less than `bllen`**
