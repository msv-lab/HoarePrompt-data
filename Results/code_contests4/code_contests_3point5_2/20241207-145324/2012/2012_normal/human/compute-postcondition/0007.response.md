Postcondition: ***a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits. i and j are integers such that 0 <= i, j <= len(a) = len(b), alen is not greater than blen. For the loop to execute the first time, i is less than alen and j is less than blen. The character at index i in string a is less than the character at index j in string b***
