Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two large integers as strings and removes any leading zeroes.
- The `func_1` function correctly compares the integers based on their lengths and individual digits, returning '<', '>', or '=' as needed.
- The code handles the cases where `a` is less than `b`, `a` is greater than `b`, or `a` is equal to `b` as per the problem description.
- The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
