Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two non-negative integers represented as strings `a` and `b`, as well as two integers `i` and `j`. The function then compares the two integers character by character, starting from indices `i` and `j`, respectively. If the characters are different, it returns '<' if `a[i]` is less than `b[j]`, '>' if `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, and '=' if they are equal.

The program follows the problem description accurately by comparing the input integers character by character and returning the correct symbols '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison. The program also considers cases where the numbers have leading zeroes, as specified in the problem description.
