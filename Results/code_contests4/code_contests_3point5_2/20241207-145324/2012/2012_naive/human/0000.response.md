Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads two very long integers a and b as input and compares them correctly.
- It handles cases where a or b may contain leading zeroes by ignoring them in the comparison.
- The function `func_1` compares the lengths of a and b and returns the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.
- The main part of the program iterates through the digits of a and b, comparing them one by one and returns the correct symbol based on the comparison.
- The program outputs the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison of a and b.
