Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly reads the participant numbers and the number of fish caught, then iterates over the input values to find the participant with the highest number of fish caught. If there are multiple winners, it selects the one with the lowest participant number. Finally, it outputs the winner's participant number and the number of fish caught, which aligns with the problem description. The program handles the case of multiple winners correctly by choosing the one with the lowest participant number.
