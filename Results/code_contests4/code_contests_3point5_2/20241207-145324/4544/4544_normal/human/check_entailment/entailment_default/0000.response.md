Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` reads the input values representing participant numbers and the number of fish they caught. It then iterates through the input values and finds the participant with the highest number of fish caught. If multiple participants have caught the same maximum number of fish, it selects the one with the lowest participant number. The function then prints out the participant number and the corresponding number of fish caught. 

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the description. The code handles the scenario where multiple participants have the same maximum number of fish caught by selecting the one with the lowest participant number. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct in meeting the requirements of the problem description.
