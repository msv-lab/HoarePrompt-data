Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input values representing participant numbers and the number of fish they caught. It then iterates through the input values and finds the participant with the highest number of fish caught. If multiple participants have caught the same maximum number of fish, it selects the one with the lowest participant number. The function prints out the participant number and the corresponding number of fish caught. The function does not have a specific return value mentioned.**
