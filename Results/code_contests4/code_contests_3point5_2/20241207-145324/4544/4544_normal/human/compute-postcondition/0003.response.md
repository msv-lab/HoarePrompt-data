Example Answer:
`a` and `v` are assigned the values of integers extracted from the input after splitting. The values of `a` and `v` depend on the input provided by the user, and the initial state values of `value` and `number` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `value` is -1, `number` is greater than 0, `a` and `v` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`value` is -1, `number` is greater than 0, `a` and `v` are assigned values based on user input**
