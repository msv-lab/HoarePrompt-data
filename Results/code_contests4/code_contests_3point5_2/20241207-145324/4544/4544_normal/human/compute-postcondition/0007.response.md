Postcondition: ***`value` is an integer, `number` is a positive integer, `a` and `v` are assigned values based on user input. If `v` is greater than the current value of `value`, `value` is updated to `v`. If `v` is equal to the current value of `value` and `a` is less than `number`, `value` is updated to `v`.***
