According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value returned by the `readline()` function inside the `int()` function. Since `number` is unknown and determines how many times the loop will execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `number` is greater than 0. Additionally, since `value` is -1 before the loop starts, we need to adjust it to `number` is greater than 0 and `value` is -1 for the loop to execute successfully.

State: **`value` is -1, `number` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute successfully**
