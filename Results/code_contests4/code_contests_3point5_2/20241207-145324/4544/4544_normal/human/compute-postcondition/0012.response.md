Postcondition: ***`value`, `number` are integers. If `v` is greater than `value` or if `v` is equal to `value` and `a` is less than `number`, then `value` takes the value of `v` and `number` takes the value of `a`. `a` and `v` are assigned values based on user input, for the loop to execute one more time the input from the user must be greater than 0.***
