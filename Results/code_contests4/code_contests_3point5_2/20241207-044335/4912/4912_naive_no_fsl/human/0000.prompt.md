You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Rng is going to a festival.

The name of the festival is given to you as a string S, which ends with `FESTIVAL`, from input. Answer the question: "Rng is going to a festival of what?" Output the answer.

Here, assume that the name of "a festival of s" is a string obtained by appending `FESTIVAL` to the end of s. For example, `CODEFESTIVAL` is a festival of `CODE`.

Constraints

* 9 \leq |S| \leq 50
* S consists of uppercase English letters.
* S ends with `FESTIVAL`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


S


Output

Print the answer to the question: "Rng is going to a festival of what?"

    if m == 3:
        temp = max(x[0], x[1], x[2])
    if m == 4:
        temp = max(x[0] + x[2], x[3] + max(x[0], x[1]))
    if m >= 5:
        f.append([x[0], x[1]])
        f.append([x[1], max(x[2], x[0])])
        f.append(x[0] + x[2], x[3] + f[0])
        for i in range(3, m - 1):
            f.append(x[i] + max(f[i - 2][0], f[i - 3][0]))
            f.append(x[i + 1] + max(f[i - 2][0], f[i - 2][1]))
        temp = max(f[-1][0], f[-1][1], f[-2][0])
    count += temp
print(count)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
