You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Rng is going to a festival.

The name of the festival is given to you as a string S, which ends with `FESTIVAL`, from input. Answer the question: "Rng is going to a festival of what?" Output the answer.

Here, assume that the name of "a festival of s" is a string obtained by appending `FESTIVAL` to the end of s. For example, `CODEFESTIVAL` is a festival of `CODE`.

Constraints

* 9 \leq |S| \leq 50
* S consists of uppercase English letters.
* S ends with `FESTIVAL`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```

    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    res = []
    count = 0
    if (s[0] == '1') :
        one = 1
    else :
        one = 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *S is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`; n is an input integer; res is an empty list; count is 0. If the first character of S is '1', then one is assigned the value 1. If the first character of S is not '1', then one is assigned the value 0.

    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user input. It then processes the string `s` based on certain conditions and calculates a final count. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on the constraints where `s` is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`. The functionality includes iterating over the characters of `s`, extracting specific substrings, and performing calculations to obtain a final count, which is then printed at the end.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
