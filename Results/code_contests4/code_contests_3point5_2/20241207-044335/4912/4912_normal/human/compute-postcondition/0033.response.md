Example Answer:
The value of `one` is appended to the list `temp`. The value of `one` can be incremented by 1 or is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`, `n` is at least 3, `res` is a list that may contain elements, `count` may or may not be incremented, `one` is either incremented by 1 or is 0, `temp` contains the value of `one` or an empty list, `tar` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute, and the substring starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` of `S` may or may not be equal to '101'.
