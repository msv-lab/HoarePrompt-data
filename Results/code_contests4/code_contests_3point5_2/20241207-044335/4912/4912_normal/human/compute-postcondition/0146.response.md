Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `S` is a string of length between 9 and 50, ending with `FESTIVAL`, `n` is at least 2, `res` contains the appended `temp` list and is non-empty, `count` is the sum of all `temp` values calculated in each iteration of the loop, `one` is either incremented by `n` or `n-1`, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `m - 2`, the substring starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` of `S` may or may not be equal to '101', `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the last two elements and the second last element of list `f`, `m` depends on the length of `x`, and `f` contains the appended values based on the conditions within the loop. `count` is printed.**
