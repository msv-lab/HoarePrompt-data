Example Answer: 
The value of `f` list is appended with the result of `x[i + 1] + max(f[i - 2][0], f[i - 2][1])`. Since `i` is 3, `x[4]` is accessed. The value of `f[i - 2][0]` and `f[i - 2][1]` is retrieved from the previous elements of the list `f`. The new element is added to the `f` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is initialized, `f` list is appended with a new element, `x` is defined with appropriate values, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, and `f` list is updated with the new element.
Output State: **`temp` is initialized, `f` list is appended with a new element, `x` is defined with appropriate values, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, and `f` list is updated with the new element**
