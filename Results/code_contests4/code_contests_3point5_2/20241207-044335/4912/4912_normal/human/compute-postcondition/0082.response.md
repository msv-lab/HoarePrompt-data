Example Answer:
The value of `f` is appended with `x[i + 1] + max(f[i - 2][0], f[i - 2][1])`. The initial value of `f` is [x[0], x[1]], `i` is 3. Therefore, the new value of `f` will be [x[0], x[1], x[4] + max(f[1][0], f[0][0])]. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`S` is a string of length between 9 and 50 ending with `FESTIVAL`, `n` is at least 2, `res` contains the appended `temp` list and is non-empty, `count` may or may not be incremented, `one` is either incremented by `n` or `n-1`, `temp` contains the appended value of `one`, `tar` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3, the substring starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` of `S` may or may not be equal to '101', `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`, `m` is equal to 6, `f` contains the appended [x[0], x[1], x[4] + max(f[1][0], f[0][0])]**
