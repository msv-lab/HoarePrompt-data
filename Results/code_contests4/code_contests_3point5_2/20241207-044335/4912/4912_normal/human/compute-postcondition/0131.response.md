Example Answer:
The code snippet is trying to append elements to list `f` by summing specific indices of list `x` and `f`. However, the syntax `f.append()` only accepts one argument, so the addition operation needs to be done separately. The initial state shows that `temp` is an integer and `f` is a list with appended elements containing specified values. After running the code and considering the syntax correction, the new elements appended to `f` would be the sum of `x[0] + x[2]` and `x[3] + f[0]`. 
Output State: **`temp` is an integer, `f` is a list with appended elements containing specified values and new elements being the sum of `x[0] + x[2]` and `x[3] + f[0]**.
