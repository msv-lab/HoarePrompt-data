Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`, but the initial state of list `x` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`, `f` is an empty list.
Output State: **`temp` is assigned the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`, `f` is an empty list**
