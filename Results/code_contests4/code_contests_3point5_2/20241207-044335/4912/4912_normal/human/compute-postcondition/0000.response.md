Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `S` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **S is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`; `n` is an input integer**
