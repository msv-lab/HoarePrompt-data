Example Answer:
The code appends a new list `[x[1], max(x[2], x[0])]` to the list `f`. The values of `temp` and `f` remain unchanged if `m` is equal to 4 and not equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an integer, `f` is a list with the new element [x[0], x[1]] appended to it.
Output State: **`temp` is an integer, `f` is a list with the new element [x[0], x[1]] appended to it**
