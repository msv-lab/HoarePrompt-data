Example Answer:
`temp` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **S is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`; n is an input integer; res is an empty list; count is 0. If the first character of S is '1', then one is assigned the value 1. If the first character of S is not '1', then one is assigned the value 0; temp is an empty list.**
