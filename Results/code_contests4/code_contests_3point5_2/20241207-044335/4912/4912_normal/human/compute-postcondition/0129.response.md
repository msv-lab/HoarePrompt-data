Example Answer:
`f` appends a list containing the first and second elements of list `x`. The value of `temp` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an integer, `f` is a list with appended elements.
Output State: **`temp` is an integer, `f` is a list with appended elements**
