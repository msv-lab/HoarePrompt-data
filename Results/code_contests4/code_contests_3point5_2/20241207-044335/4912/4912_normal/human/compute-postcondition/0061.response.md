Example Answer:
The `temp` list is copied and appended to the `res` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`, `n` is at least 2, `res` contains the appended `temp` list, `count` may or may not be incremented, `one` is either incremented by `n` or `n-1`, `temp` contains the appended value of `one`, `tar` is 1, `i` is `n-1` for the loop to execute, and the substring starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` of `S` may or may not be equal to '101'.
