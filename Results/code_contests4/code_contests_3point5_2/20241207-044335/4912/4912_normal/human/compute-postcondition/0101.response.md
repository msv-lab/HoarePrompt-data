Example Answer:
If `m` is equal to 2, `temp` will be assigned the maximum value between `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`, and `f` will remain an empty list. If `m` is not equal to 2, there will be no change in the values of `temp` and `f`. The calculation of `temp` depends on the values of `x[0]`, `x[1]`, `x[2]`, and `x[3]` which are not provided in the initial state. 
Output State: **If `m` is equal to 2, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`, and `f` remains an empty list. If `m` is not equal to 2, there is no change in the values of `temp` and `f`.**
