Example Answer:
`f` has a new element appended to it, which is calculated based on the values of `x`, `f`, and `i`. The value appended is `x[i + 1] + max(f[i - 2][0], f[i - 2][1])`. The previous values of `x`, `f`, and `i` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of the new element added to `f`. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an integer, `f` is updated with a new element based on the previous values of `x`, `f`, and `i`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 4.
Output State: **`temp` is an integer, `f` is updated with a new element based on the previous values of `x`, `f`, and `i`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 4**
