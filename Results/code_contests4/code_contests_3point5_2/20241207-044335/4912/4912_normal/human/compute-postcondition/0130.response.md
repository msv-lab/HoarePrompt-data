Example Answer:
The code appends a list containing the second element of list `x` and the maximum value between the first and third element of list `x` to list `f`. The previous values of variables `temp` and `f` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is an integer, `f` is a list with appended elements containing the specified values.
Output State: **`temp` is an integer, `f` is a list with appended elements containing specified values**
