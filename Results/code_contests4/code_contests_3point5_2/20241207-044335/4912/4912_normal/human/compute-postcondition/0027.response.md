Postcondition: ***`S` is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`, `n` is at least 3, `res` is a list containing elements based on the condition (s[i] == '0' and tar == 1), `count` is 0, `one` is either incremented by 1 or is 0 based on the condition in the if else block, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is 0, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute, and the substring starting at index `i - 1` and ending at index `i + 2` of `S` is not equal to '101'. The state of the program variables remains unchanged if the conditions in the if else block are not met.***
