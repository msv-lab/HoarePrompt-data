Example Answer:
If m == 2, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the sum of the first and third elements of list `x` and the sum of the fourth element and the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`. If m == 3, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the sum of the first and third elements of list `x` and the sum of the fourth element and the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`. The state of list `f` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`temp` is assigned the maximum value based on the conditions mentioned above, `f` remains an empty list**
