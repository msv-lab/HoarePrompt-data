Example Answer:
`tar` is assigned the value 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`; n is an input integer; res is an empty list; count is 0. If the first character of S is '1', then one is assigned the value 1. If the first character of S is not '1', then one is assigned the value 0; temp is an empty list; tar is 0.
