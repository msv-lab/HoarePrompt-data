Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`. Since the initial values of `temp` and `f` are known, we can calculate that `temp` will be updated to the maximum of `x[0]` and `x[1]`, and `f` remains an empty list.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum of x[0] and x[1], `f` is an empty list**
