Example Answer:
`f` is appended with the sum of `x[i]` and the maximum value between the 0th index of elements `f[i-2]` and `f[i-3]`. The loop will execute when `m` is greater than or equal to 4 and `i` is 3. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is initialized, `f` list is appended with a new element, `x` is defined with appropriate values, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 3.
Output State: **`temp` is initialized, `f` list is appended with a new element, `x` is defined with appropriate values, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 3**
