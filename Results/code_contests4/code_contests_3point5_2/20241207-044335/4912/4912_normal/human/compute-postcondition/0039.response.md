Output State: **`S` is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`, `n` is at least 3, `res` is a list containing elements where `temp` has been copied, `count` may or may not be incremented, `one` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is 0, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute, and the substring starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` of `S` may or may not be equal to '101'. If `S[i] == '0` and `tar == 1`, then the program state remains the same as described.**
