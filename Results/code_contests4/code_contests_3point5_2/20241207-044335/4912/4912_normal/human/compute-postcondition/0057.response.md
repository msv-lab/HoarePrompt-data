Output State: **`S` is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`, `n` is at least 2, `res` is a list containing elements where `temp` has been copied, `count` may or may not be incremented, `one` is either incremented by `n` or `n-1`, `temp` is an empty list, `tar` is 0, `i` is `n-1` for the loop to execute, and the substring starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` of `S` may or may not be equal to '101'. If `S[i] == '0'` and `tar == 1`, then the program state remains the same as described. If `S[i] == '1'`, `one` is either incremented by `n` or `n-1`. Additionally, if `S[-1]` is '1', then the program state is updated according to the if condition.**
