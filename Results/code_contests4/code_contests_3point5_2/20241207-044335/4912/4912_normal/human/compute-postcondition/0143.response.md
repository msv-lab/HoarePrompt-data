Postcondition: ***`temp` is an integer, `f` is a list. If m is equal to 2 or 3, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x`. If m is equal to 4, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the first and second elements of list `x` and `f` remains an empty list. If m is greater than or equal to 5, `temp` is assigned the maximum value among the elements `f[-1][0]`, `f[-1][1]`, and `f[-2][0]`.***
