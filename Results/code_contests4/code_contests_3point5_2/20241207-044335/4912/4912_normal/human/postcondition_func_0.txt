The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user input. It then processes the string `s` based on certain conditions and calculates a final count. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on the constraints where `s` is a string of length between 9 and 50, consisting of uppercase English letters and ending with `FESTIVAL`. The functionality includes iterating over the characters of `s`, extracting specific substrings, and performing calculations to obtain a final count, which is then printed at the end.
