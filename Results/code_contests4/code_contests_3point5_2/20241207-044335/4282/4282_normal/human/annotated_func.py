#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a non-negative integer representing the number of #define constructions in the program. Each #define construction consists of a macro name and an arithmetic expression. The expressions in the #define constructions are correct arithmetic expressions that may contain non-negative integers, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/. The names of variables and #define constructions are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters. The last line of input contains an expression to be checked, which is also a correct arithmetic expression following the same limitations as the expressions in #define constructions.**
def func_1(c):
    return 'macro("' + c + '")'
    #The program returns the macro with the name 'c' after evaluating the arithmetic expression associated with it
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a string parameter c representing a macro name. It then returns a string representing the evaluation of the arithmetic expression associated with the macro named c in the format 'macro("evaluation")'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a non-negative integer. Each #define construction has the format "#define name expression", where name is a string representing the macro name, and expression is a valid arithmetic expression consisting of digits, variables, previously declared macro names, round brackets, and operational signs + - * /. The expression is guaranteed to be a correct arithmetic expression before and after macro substitution, having no unary operations. All names are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters. The length of any line from the input file does not exceed 100 characters.**

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`f` is a list that contains the final string after evaluating the mathematical expression, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the last character of `s`. If `n` is not empty, then `f[0]` is updated based on the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.
    return eval(f[0]).level
    #The program returns the level after evaluating the mathematical expression stored in the list 'f[0]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts a list of strings representing arithmetic expressions with macro definitions. It then processes each character in the input string, evaluates the mathematical expression, and returns the level after evaluating the expression stored in the list 'f[0]'. If a character is an operator or parentheses, the function handles the expression accordingly. However, the annotation mentions a function func_1 that is not defined or used in the provided code, indicating missing functionality or logic.
