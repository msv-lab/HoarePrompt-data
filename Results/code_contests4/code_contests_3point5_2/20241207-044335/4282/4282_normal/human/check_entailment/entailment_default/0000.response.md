Based on the provided code and description, it seems that the code is correct in handling the macro substitution and arithmetic expressions as per the problem description. 

The code defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, to evaluate arithmetic expressions with macros. The func_1 function processes a given macro name and returns the evaluation of the associated arithmetic expression in a specific format. The func_2 function processes the input expressions, performs macro substitution, evaluates the expressions based on arithmetic rules, and checks if the final substitution result matches the safe substitution result. The code also defines a class 'macro' to handle arithmetic operations and levels of operation based on the input expressions.

The code uses a dictionary to store macro definitions and processes each character in the input expressions to handle operators and parentheses appropriately. It ensures the safe substitution by adding brackets to each macro value for evaluation.

The output hints match the code functionality and explain the process of evaluating arithmetic expressions with macros and ensuring the correct order of calculations. The hints reinforce the logic and structure of the code, indicating that the code is correctly implemented to handle macro substitution and arithmetic expressions as described in the problem.

Therefore, considering the code structure, functionality, and the agreement between the output hints and the code implementation, the correctness of the code can be evaluated as:

Correctness: **True**.
