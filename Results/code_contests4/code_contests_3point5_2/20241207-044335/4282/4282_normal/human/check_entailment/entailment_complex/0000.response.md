Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. 
1. The function `func_1` is mentioned in the annotations but not defined or used in the provided code, which indicates missing functionality or logic.
2. The code does not handle the case where the arithmetic expression contains unary operations, which is a limitation stated in the problem description.
3. The implementation of `func_2` does not demonstrate the correct evaluation and substitution of macros in the given arithmetic expressions according to the problem description.
4. The code lacks the proper handling of precedence and order of operations, which is crucial for determining if the expression is suspicious or not.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description requirements.
