Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not fully implement the problem description. While it does include two functions that seem to handle the evaluation of arithmetic expressions with macros, the implementation is not clear and lacks proper documentation. The program does not handle the scenario where the order of calculations changes due to the presence of macros, which is a key requirement in the problem description.

Additionally, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not clearly defined in terms of what they are supposed to do and how they are expected to interact with each other. The program also lacks proper input parsing and handling, which is crucial for processing the input according to the problem description.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and would need significant modifications to correctly verify the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description.
