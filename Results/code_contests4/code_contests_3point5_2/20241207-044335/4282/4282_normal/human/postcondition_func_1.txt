The function func_2 accepts a list of strings representing arithmetic expressions with macro definitions. It then processes each character in the input string, evaluates the mathematical expression, and returns the level after evaluating the expression stored in the list 'f[0]'. If a character is an operator or parentheses, the function handles the expression accordingly. However, the annotation mentions a function func_1 that is not defined or used in the provided code, indicating missing functionality or logic.
