**Precondition**: 
- n is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- Each #define construction has the syntax "#define name expression" where name is a string representing the macro name, and expression is a non-empty string representing the arithmetic expression with digits, variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/. The expression is guaranteed to be a correct arithmetic expression with no unary operations, and contains only non-negative integers not exceeding 10^9.
- The names of variables and #define constructions are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters, and are different from each other.
- The last line of input contains a non-empty expression that satisfies the same limitations as the expressions in the #define constructions.
