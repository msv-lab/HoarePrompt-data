**Precondition**: **n is a non-negative integer representing the number of #define constructions in the program. Each #define construction consists of a macro name and an arithmetic expression. The expressions in the #define constructions are correct arithmetic expressions that may contain non-negative integers, names of variables, names of previously declared macros, round brackets, and operational signs +-*/. The names of variables and #define constructions are strings of case-sensitive Latin characters. The last line of input contains an expression to be checked, which is also a correct arithmetic expression following the same limitations as the expressions in #define constructions.**
