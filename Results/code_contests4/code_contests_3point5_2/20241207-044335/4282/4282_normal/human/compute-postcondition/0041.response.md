Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that may contain the character 'c' appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` based on the condition of `c`. If c == '(', an empty string is appended. If c == ')', `m` holds the result of `func_1('10' or '1')`. Otherwise, the last element of `f` is modified by adding the result of `func_1('10' or '1')` based on the evaluation of `f.pop()`. Additionally, `n` remains an empty string, `s` stays a non-empty string, and `c` is the next character in `s`.***
