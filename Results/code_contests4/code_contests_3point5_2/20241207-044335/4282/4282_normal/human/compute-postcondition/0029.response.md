Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`, `n` is an empty string. If `c` is equal to '(', the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` remains the same. If `c` is equal to ')', the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` is incremented by `m` and appended to the last element of `f`.***
