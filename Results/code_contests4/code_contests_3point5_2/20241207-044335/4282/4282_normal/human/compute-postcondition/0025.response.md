Example Answer:
The code snippet evaluates `f.pop()` and checks if its `level` attribute is equal to '0'. The result of this evaluation is used to index the string '10'. The value obtained from this indexing is passed to `func_1()` function. The result of `func_1()` is assigned to variable `m`. Since the initial state of `f` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `m` or the final state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`, `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`, `n` is an empty string**
