According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`, `n` is either an empty string or a concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c`, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. If `c` is equal to '(', the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` remains the same.
2. If `c` is equal to ')', the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` is incremented by `m` and appended to the last element of `f`.
3. `n` is updated based on the value of `c`.
4. The next character `c` is the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is not equal to '(', otherwise it is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the next character in `s`**
