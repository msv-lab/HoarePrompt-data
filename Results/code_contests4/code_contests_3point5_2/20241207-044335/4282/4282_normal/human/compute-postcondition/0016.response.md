Postcondition: ***`f` is a list with the character `c` appended to the last element, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `c` is one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')'. If `n` is not empty, then the program retains its initial state without any changes. The character `c` is not equal to '(' and if `c` is equal to ')', then `m` is assigned the value of `func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])` and the value of `f[-1]` is updated based on the calculation of `m`.***
