Example Answer:
The value of `n` is used to get the value from dictionary `v`. If the key `n` exists in `v`, then the value corresponding to `n` is retrieved, otherwise '1' is used. The retrieved value is then passed to `func_1`. The result of `func_1` is added to the last element of list `f`. Since `f` may contain the character `c` appended to the last element, the new value will be added to that element. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`.
Output State: **`f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))`**
