Output State: **`f` is initialized with an empty list, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, `c` is one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')'; if `n` is not empty, then the program retains its initial state without any changes. The character `c` is not equal to '('. The character `c` is equal to ')', and `m` is assigned the value of func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0']). The value of `f[-1]` is updated based on the calculation of `m`.**
