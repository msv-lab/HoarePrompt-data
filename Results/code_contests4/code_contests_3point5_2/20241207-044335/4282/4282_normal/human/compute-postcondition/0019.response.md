Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element, `n` is either an empty string or the first character of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`. If `c` is one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')' and `n` is not empty, the program retains its initial state without any changes. If `c` is not equal to '(' and equal to ')', `m` is assigned the value of `func_1('10'[eval(f.pop()).level == '0'])` and the value of `f[-1]` is updated based on the calculation of `m`. If `c` is not one of the specified characters, `f` is an initialized empty list, `n` is the first character of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`.***
