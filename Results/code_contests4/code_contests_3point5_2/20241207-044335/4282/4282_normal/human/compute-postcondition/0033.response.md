Example Answer: 
The last element of list `f` is appended with the value returned by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`. The value of `n` is updated by concatenating the previous value of `n` with `c` if `c` is not equal to '(', otherwise it remains an empty string. The value of `s` is unchanged, and `c` is updated to the next character in `s`. 
Output State: **`f` is updated with the value returned by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`, `n` is updated based on the value of `c`, `s` remains a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in `s`**
