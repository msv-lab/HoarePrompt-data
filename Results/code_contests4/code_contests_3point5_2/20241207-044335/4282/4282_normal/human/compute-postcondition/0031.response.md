Postcondition: ***`f` is a list that may contain the character `c` appended to the last element with the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))`. If `c` is equal to '(', the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` remains the same. If `c` is equal to ')', the value added by `func_1(v.get('', '1'))` is incremented by `m` and appended to the last element of `f`. Furthermore, `n` is an empty string if the if part is executed, otherwise `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c`. `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s` for the next iteration.***
