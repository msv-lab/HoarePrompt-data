Example Answer: 
The code appends the result of `func_1(v.get(n, '1'))` to the last element of list `f`. Since `f` is initially an empty list, this operation will raise an IndexError. The value of `n` is not used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is an empty list, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, and the character `c` is one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')'.
Output State: **`f` is an empty list, `n` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, and the character `c` is one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', ')'**
