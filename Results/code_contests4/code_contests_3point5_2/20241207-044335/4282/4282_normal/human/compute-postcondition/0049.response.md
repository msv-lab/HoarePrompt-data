The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list of strings representing arithmetic expressions with macro definitions. The function evaluates the mathematical expression stored in the list `f[0]` after substituting the macro definitions. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept a list of strings representing arithmetic expressions with macro definitions and return the level after evaluating the mathematical expression stored in the list `f[0]`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of strings representing arithmetic expressions with macro definitions and returns the level after evaluating the mathematical expression stored in the list 'f[0]'.**
