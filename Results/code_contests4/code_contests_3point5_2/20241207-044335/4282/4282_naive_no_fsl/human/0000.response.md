Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program implements the logic to determine if a given expression with #define constructions is correct or suspicious based on the problem description provided. The program correctly parses the input, handles macro substitution, and checks if the expression is correct or suspicious. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. Additionally, the program includes functions for macro addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are used in the macro substitution process. Overall, the program appears to be correctly implemented and should work as intended for the given problem.
