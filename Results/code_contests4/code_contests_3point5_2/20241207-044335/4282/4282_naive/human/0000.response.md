Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, processes the #define constructions to determine the level of each expression, and then checks if the given expression is correct or suspicious based on the calculated levels. The program handles the arithmetic operations correctly and checks if the expression is suspicious or not. The logic and implementation seem to align with the problem description, and there are no obvious issues that could lead to incorrect behavior.
