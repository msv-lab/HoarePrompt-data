Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `-2`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the program continues with the stated variables unchanged.***
