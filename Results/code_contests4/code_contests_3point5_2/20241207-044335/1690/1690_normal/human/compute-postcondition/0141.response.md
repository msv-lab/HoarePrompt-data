According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, and the condition related to `cur` and `s[j]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, `en` is `n`, `cur` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `be` is incremented by 1, `tem` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be incremented by 1
- `cur` should be checked against `i` and updated accordingly
- The condition related to `s[j]` and `word[cur]` should be evaluated and variables adjusted based on the outcome

State: **`j` is `n`, `en` is `n`, `cur` is updated based on conditions, `be` is incremented by 1, `tem` is updated based on conditions, the loop executes `n` times where `n` is greater than 0**
