Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is updated based on the condition described. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `ans` and `tem`.
Output State: **`j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `ans` and `tem`**
