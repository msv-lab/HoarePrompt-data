According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i`, and the list `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `cur` is either equal to `i` or -1, `be` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` is greater than 0 and `cur` is 1 after the first iteration. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, `cur` is -1 and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`. `en` is decreased by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `cur` is either equal to `i` or -1, `be` is 0, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0, and `cur` must be 1 after the first iteration**
