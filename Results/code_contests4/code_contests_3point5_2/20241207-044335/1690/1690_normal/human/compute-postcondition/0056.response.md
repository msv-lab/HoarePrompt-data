Example Answer:
`tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`, where `j` is already incremented by 1. The values of `tem` and `a[j]` are unknown, so the output state is: `j` is incremented by 1, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`**
