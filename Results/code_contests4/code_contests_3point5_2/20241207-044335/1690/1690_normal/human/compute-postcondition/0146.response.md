Output State: **`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be + 1`, `tem` are integers. `cur` is updated based on conditions, `be` is incremented by 1, `tem` is updated based on conditions. The loop executes `n` times where `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.**
