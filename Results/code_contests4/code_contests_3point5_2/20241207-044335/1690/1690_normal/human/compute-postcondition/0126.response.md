According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `en`, which means `en` should be less than `n` for the loop to start executing. Additionally, `cur` is equal to 0, `be` is 0, `en` is equal to `n`, and `tem` is 0. So, in order for the loop to execute, `en` should be less than `n`, and `j` should be equal to `en` which implies `j` should be equal to `n` as well.
State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is equal to 0, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
