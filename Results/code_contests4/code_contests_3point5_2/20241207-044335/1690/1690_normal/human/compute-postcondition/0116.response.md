Example Answer:
`tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The previous values of `tem`, `a[j]`, and other variables are unknown, so the final output state is: `j` is equal to `be + 1`, `for the loop to execute one more time be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `be + 1`, `for the loop to execute one more time be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`**
