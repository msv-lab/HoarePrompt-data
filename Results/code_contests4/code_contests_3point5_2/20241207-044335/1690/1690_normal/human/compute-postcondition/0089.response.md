According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `j` is less than `en + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is `n-1` and `s`, `word`, `tem`, `ans`, `be`, `en`, `cur` are in their initial states.
State: **`j` is `n-1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
