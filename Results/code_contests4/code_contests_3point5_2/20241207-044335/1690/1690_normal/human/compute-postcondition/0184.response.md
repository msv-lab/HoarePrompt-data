Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value stored in the variable `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` calculated in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` holds the minimum value of `tem`.
Output State: **`j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` holds the minimum value of `tem`**
