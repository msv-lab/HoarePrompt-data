Output State: `j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be` are integers. `cur` is either equal to `i` or incremented based on conditions. `be` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The loop executes `n` times where `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` is incremented by 1. `tem` remains 0 after all iterations of the loop.
