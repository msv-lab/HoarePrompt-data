According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` should be less than `en`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is increased by 1 so `j` should be updated accordingly. Additionally, if the element at index `j` of list `s` is equal to the element at index `i` of list `word`, `tem` should be updated based on the value at index `j` of list `a`.
State: **`j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers. For the loop to execute, `be` should be less than `en`. If the element at index `j` of list `s` is equal to the element at index `i` of list `word`, `tem` is updated based on the value at index `j` of list `a`**
