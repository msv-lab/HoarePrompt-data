Output State: **`rstr, rints` are lambda functions, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the state remains the same with `cur` being either 2 or 3.**
