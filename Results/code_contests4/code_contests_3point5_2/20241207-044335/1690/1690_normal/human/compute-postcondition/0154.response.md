Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state states that `cur` is 0, after execution, `cur` becomes -1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem` are integers. `cur` is -1. For the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. `cur` is 1 after the first iteration. `cur` is not equal to `i`. `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.
Output State: **`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem` are integers. `cur` is -1. For the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. `cur` is 1 after the first iteration. `cur` is not equal to `i`. `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`**
