Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 2, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers. The value of `cur` is not equal to `i`. The character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`.***
