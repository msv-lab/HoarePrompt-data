According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` to 0 in reverse order, so `n` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `cur` is assigned the value 3, so it needs to be adjusted to `cur` is 0 since the loop starts with `cur` being incremented by 1. Additionally, `be` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so `be` should be initialized to 0. At the end of all iterations, `tem` remains 0, so no adjustment is needed for `tem`. Lastly, if `cur` is supposed to be incremented when `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then `cur` should be 1 after the first iteration.
State: **`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur` are integers, `cur` is 0, `be` is 0, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is 1 after the first iteration**
