According to the code, the loop can execute 4 times as specified by the range. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` such that `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]` for all `j` from `be` to `en-1`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is equal to 3. Since the loop is to be executed one more time, we need to adjust the following states:

State: **`j` is equal to `en`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is equal to 4**
