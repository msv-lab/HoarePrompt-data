Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `be`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is updated to `tem + a[j]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`***
