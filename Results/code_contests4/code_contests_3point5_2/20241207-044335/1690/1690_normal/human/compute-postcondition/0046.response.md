Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. Since we know that `cur` is equal to `-2`, after execution, `cur` will be `-3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `-2`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `cur` is `-3`.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `-2`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `cur` is `-3`**
