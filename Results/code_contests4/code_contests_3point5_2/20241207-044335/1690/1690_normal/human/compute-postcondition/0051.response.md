According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. Since `j` is the iterating variable in the for loop, the loop will execute as long as the range between `be` and `en` is valid. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- `j` needs to be updated to `be` for the loop to start at the correct value.
- `en` needs to be adjusted to be different from `n-n`, as it is currently equal to 0. `en` should be equal to `n` instead.
- Since `en` has been updated to `n`, `j` should also be updated to `be` which is equal to `n`.

State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute properly**
