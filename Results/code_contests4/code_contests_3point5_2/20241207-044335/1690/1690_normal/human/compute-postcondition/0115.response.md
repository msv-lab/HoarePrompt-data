According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be`, `en`, and the length of the list `s`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `be`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is updated to `tem + a[j]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is equal to 3, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `be` needs to be less than `en` and `en` needs to be less than `n - 1` and `s[j]` must be equal to `word[i]` for the next index `j`.
State: **`j` is equal to `be + 1`, `for the loop to execute one more time be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`.**
