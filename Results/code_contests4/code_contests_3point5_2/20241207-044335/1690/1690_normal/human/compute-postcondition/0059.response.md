Example Answer:
The value of `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The values of `j`, `en`, `s[j]`, and `word[i]` are not provided, so it is not possible to determine the exact values of `tem`. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is less than `en` and the conditions for `s[j]` being equal to `word[i]` need to be satisfied for `j` and `tem` to be adjusted properly.
Output State: **`j` is less than `en` and the conditions for `s[j]` being equal to `word[i]` need to be satisfied for `j` and `tem` to be adjusted properly**
