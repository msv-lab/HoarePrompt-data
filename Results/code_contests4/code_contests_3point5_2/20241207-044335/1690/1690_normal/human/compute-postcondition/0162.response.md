Postcondition: ***`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, `cur` is either `i-1` or -2. `be` is 0, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0, and `cur` must be 1 after the first iteration.***
