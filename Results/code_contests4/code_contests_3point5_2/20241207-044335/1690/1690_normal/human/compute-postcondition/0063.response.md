According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `en`, `s`, `word`, `tem`, and `ans`. If `j` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `en`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`j` is less than `en + 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`**
