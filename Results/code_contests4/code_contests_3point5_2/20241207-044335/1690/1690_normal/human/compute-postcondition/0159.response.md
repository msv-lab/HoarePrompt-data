Output State: **`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `cur` is either equal to `i` or -1, `be` is 0, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0, and `cur` must be 1 after the first iteration and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
