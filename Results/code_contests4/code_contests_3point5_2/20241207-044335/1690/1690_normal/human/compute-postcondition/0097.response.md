Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i` and the element at index `j` in the list `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in the string `word`, then the program state remains the same.**
