According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `s`, `word`, `tem`, `ans`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, and `i`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `en + 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the loop or if statement is broken. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute `n` must still be greater than 0.
State: **`j` is less than `en + 2`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
