Example Answer:
`en` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `en` is `n`, so after execution, `en` becomes `n-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `n - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `n - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`.**
