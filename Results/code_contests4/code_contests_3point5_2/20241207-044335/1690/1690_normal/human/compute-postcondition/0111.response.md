According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. The loop will execute if `be` is less than `en`. Before the loop starts, `j` is less than `n - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `be` is less than `en` and `j` is now equal to `be`.

State: **`j` is equal to `be`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is less than `n - 1`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute `be` is less than `en`**
