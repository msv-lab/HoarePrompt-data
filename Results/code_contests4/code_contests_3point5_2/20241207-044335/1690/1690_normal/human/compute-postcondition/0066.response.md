According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the condition `j is less than en + 1` ensures that `j` is within the range of the loop. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`j` is less than `en + 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
