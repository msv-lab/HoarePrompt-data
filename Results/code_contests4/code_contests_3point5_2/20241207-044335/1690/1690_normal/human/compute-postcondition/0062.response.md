Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `tem`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is less than `en`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`.
Output State: **`j` is less than `en`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`**
