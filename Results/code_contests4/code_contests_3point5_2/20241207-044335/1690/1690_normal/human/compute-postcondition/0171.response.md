According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. If the range specified by `be` and `en` is valid, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, and `i` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. 

State: **`j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers, for the loop to execute `be` should be less than `en`**
