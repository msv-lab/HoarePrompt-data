According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, and `i`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `n`, `en` are decreased by 1, `cur` is either `i-1` or -2, `be` is 0, `tem` is an integer, `i` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `cur` must be 1 after the first iteration.
State: **`j`, `n`, `en` is decreased by 1, `cur` is 1, `be` is 0, `tem` is an integer, `i` are integers, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0**
