Postcondition: ***`j`, `n`, `en` are integers. If `cur == i`, then `j`, `n`, `en` are decreased by 1, `cur` is 1, `be` is 0, `tem` is an integer, `i` are integers. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur != i`, then `j`, `n`, `en` are decreased by 1, `cur` is decreased by 1, `be` is 0, `tem` is an integer, `i` are integers. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.***
