Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cur` is either equal to `i` or -1, so after execution, `cur` will be either `i-1` or -2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `cur` is either `i-1` or -2, `be` is 0, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0, and `cur` must be 1 after the first iteration.
Output State: **`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers, `cur` is either `i-1` or -2, `be` is 0, `en` is decreased by 1, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than 0, and `cur` must be 1 after the first iteration.**
