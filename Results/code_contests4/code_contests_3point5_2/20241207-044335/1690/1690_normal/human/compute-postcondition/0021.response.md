According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`rstr, rints are lambda functions`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2**.
