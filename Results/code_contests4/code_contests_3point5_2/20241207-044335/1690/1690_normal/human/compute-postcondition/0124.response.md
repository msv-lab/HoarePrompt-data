Example Answer:
`be`, `en`, and `tem` are assigned the values 0, `n`, and 0 respectively. The values of `j`, `en`, and `cur` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `en`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is equal to 4, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `en`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is equal to 4, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0**
