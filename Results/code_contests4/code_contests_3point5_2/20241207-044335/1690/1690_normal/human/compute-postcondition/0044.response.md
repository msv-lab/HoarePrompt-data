According to the code, the loop can execute until `j` reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is -1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be updated to -2.
State: **Output State: `j` is equal to `-2`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers**.
