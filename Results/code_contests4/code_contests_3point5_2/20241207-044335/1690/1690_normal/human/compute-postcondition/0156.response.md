Postcondition: ***`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers. `cur` is either equal to `i` or -1. `be` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` is greater than 0 and `cur` is 1 after the first iteration. If `cur` is equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, `cur` is -1 and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.***
