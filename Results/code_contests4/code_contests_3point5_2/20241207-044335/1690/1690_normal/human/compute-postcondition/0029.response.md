According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. The loop will start at `n - 1` and end at 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 3, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers.
