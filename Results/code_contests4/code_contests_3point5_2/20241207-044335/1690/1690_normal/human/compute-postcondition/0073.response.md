Postcondition: ***`j` is less than `en + 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the loop or if statement is broken.***
