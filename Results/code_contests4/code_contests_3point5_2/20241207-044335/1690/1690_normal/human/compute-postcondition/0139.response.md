Postcondition: ***`j` is `n - 1`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, the loop executes `n` times where `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i` and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the function continues. Otherwise, the function proceeds to the next iteration without any changes to the variables.***
