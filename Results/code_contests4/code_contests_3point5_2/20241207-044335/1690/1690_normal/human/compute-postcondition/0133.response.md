Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is either equal to 0 or 1, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, the loop executes `n` times where `n` is greater than 0. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is not equal to `i`, and `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`.***
