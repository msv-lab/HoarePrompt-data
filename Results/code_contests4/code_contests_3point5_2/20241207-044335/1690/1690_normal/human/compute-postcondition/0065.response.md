Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is less than `en + 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0.
Output State: **`j` is less than `en + 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is 0**
