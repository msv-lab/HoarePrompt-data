Postcondition: ***rstr, rints are lambda functions, n is a positive integer, s is a string, a is a list of integers, ans is positive infinity, word is a string 'hard', be is incremented by 1, en is n, tem is 0, cur is either 1 or 2, for the loop to execute the second time, j is 1. If cur == i, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cur != i and s[j] == word[cur], then the program state is updated accordingly.***
