Output State: **rstr is a lambda function that strips the input read from stdin, rints is a lambda function that converts input read from stdin into a list of integers, n is an input integer greater than 0, s is a string, a is a list of integers, ans is positive infinity, word is a string 'hard', be is incremented by 1, en is n, tem is 0, cur is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, j is 0. If cur == i, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, rstr is a lambda function that strips the input read from stdin, rints is a lambda function that converts input read from stdin into a list of integers, n is an input integer greater than 0, s is a string, a is a list of integers, ans is positive infinity, word is a string 'hard', be is incremented by 1, en is n, tem is 0, cur is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, j is 0, and cur is not equal to i. After the if else block executes, the function checks if s[j] is equal to word[cur].**
