Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value 0. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: rstr is a lambda function that strips the input read from stdin, rints is a lambda function that converts input read from stdin into a list of integers, n is an input integer, s is a string, a is a list of integers, ans is positive infinity, word is a string 'hard', be is 0, en is n, tem is 0, cur is 0.
Output State: **rstr is a lambda function that strips the input read from stdin, rints is a lambda function that converts input read from stdin into a list of integers, n is an input integer, s is a string, a is a list of integers, ans is positive infinity, word is a string 'hard', be is 0, en is n, tem is 0, cur is 0**
