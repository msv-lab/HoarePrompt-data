According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, `en`, `s`, `word`, `i`, `tem`, and `a`. If the condition specified is met (element at index `j` of list `s` is equal to the `i`-th character of string `word`), then `tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` of list `a`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `be`, `en` are equal to `n`. To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1
- `s`, `word`, `i`, `tem`, and `a` need to be in a state where the condition specified in the loop is met and `tem` is incremented accordingly.

State: **`j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute properly `be`, `en`, `s`, `word`, `i`, `tem`, and `a` need to be in a state where the condition specified in the loop is met**
