According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop decrements `j` by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be `n-3`.
State: **`j` is `n-3`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
