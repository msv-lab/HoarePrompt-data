According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `be`, and `en`. If `j` is less than `en`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers. If the element at index `j` of list `s` is equal to the element at index `i` of list `word`, `tem` is updated based on the value at index `j` of list `a`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1.
State: **`j+1`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers. If the element at index `j+1` of list `s` is equal to the element at index `i` of list `word`, `tem` is updated based on the value at index `j+1` of list `a`.**
