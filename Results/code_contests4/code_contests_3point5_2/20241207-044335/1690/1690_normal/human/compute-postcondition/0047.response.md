Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `-2`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-2`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `cur` is `-3`. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, then the program will continue with the stated variables unchanged.***
