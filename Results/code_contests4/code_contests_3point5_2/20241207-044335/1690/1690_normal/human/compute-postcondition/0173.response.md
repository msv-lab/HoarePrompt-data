Example Answer:
The value of `tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` of list `a`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers. `be` is less than `en`. The element at index `j` of the list `s` is equal to the element at index `i` of the list `word`. `tem` is updated based on the value at index `j` of list `a`.
Output State: **`j`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, `tem`, `i` are integers. `be` is less than `en`. The element at index `j` of the list `s` is equal to the element at index `i` of the list `word`. `tem` is updated based on the value at index `j` of list `a`.**
