Postcondition: ***rstr is a lambda function that strips the input read from stdin, rints is a lambda function that converts input read from stdin into a list of integers, n is an input integer greater than 0, s is a string, a is a list of integers, ans is positive infinity, word is a string 'hard', be is incremented by 1, en is n, tem is 0, cur is 2, for the loop to execute the second time, j is 1 and if s[j] == word[cur], then the program state is updated accordingly.***
