According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `be`, `en`, `s`, `word`, `i`, `tem`, and `a`. If `j` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `be`, `en`, `s`, `word`, `i`, `tem`, `a` are all in a state where the loop can execute properly. If `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than `en` and the conditions for incrementing `j` and `tem` need to be met based on the values of `s[j]` and `word[i]`.
State: **`j` is less than `en` and the conditions for `s[j]` being equal to `word[i]` need to be satisfied for `j` and `tem` to be adjusted properly**
