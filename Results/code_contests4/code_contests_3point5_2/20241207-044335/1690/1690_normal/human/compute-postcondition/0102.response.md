Postcondition: ***`j` is `n-2`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then the loop breaks out, otherwise if `s[j]` is equal to `word[cur]`, the program updates the variables accordingly based on the conditions specified.***
