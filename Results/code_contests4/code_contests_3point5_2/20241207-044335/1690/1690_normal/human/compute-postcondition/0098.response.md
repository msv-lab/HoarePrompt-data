According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `s`, `word`, `tem`, `ans`, `be`, `en`, `cur`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`j` is `n-2`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `cur` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
