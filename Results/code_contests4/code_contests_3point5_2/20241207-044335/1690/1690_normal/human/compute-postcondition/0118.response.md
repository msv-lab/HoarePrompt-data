According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `be + 1`, `be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`j` is equal to `be + 2`, `for the loop to execute one more time be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`**
