According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `cur`, `i`, and the content of the list `s`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is either 0 or 1, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, so `j` should be `n - 1`. 
State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `en` is less than `n`, `cur` is either 0 or 1, `be` is incremented by 1, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, the loop executes `n` times where `n` is greater than 0**
