The value of `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`. The previous value of `tem` is unknown, and the value of `a[j]` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `be + 2`, `for the loop to execute one more time be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `be + 2`, `for the loop to execute one more time be` is less than `en`, `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]`, `tem` is incremented by the value of `a[j]`**
