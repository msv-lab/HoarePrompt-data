Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `en - 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` such that `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]` for all `j` from `be` to `en-1`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is equal to 3.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `en - 1`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of all `a[j]` such that `s[j]` is equal to `word[i]` for all `j` from `be` to `en-1`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is less than `en`, `en` is less than `n - 1`, `cur` is equal to 3**
