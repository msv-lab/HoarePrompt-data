According to the code, the loop executes in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be `-1` so that the loop will end after the next iteration.
State: **`j` is equal to `-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `word` is a string 'hard', `be` is equal to `n`, `en` is `n-1`, `tem` is 0, `rstr`, `rints` are lambda functions, `s` is a string, `a` is a list of integers. If `cur` is equal to `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cur` is not equal to `i`, then the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `cur` in string `word`**
