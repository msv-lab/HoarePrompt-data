Output State: **`j`, `n`, `en`, `cur`, `be`, `tem`, `i` are integers. `cur` is 0 and `be` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` is greater than 0 and `cur` is 1 after the first iteration. When the condition `(cur == i)` is met, `cur` is equal to `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
