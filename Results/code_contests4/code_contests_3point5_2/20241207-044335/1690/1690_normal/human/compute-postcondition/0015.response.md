According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **rstr is a lambda function that strips the input read from stdin, rints is a lambda function that converts input read from stdin into a list of integers, n is an input integer greater than 0, s is a string, a is a list of integers, ans is positive infinity, word is a string 'hard', be is incremented by 1, en is n, tem is 0, cur is 1, for the loop to execute the second time, j is 1**
