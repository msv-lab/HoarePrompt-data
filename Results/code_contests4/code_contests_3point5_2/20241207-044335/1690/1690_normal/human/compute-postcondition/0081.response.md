According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and `cur`. If `j` is less than `en + 2` and `cur` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `en + 2`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, and `cur` is incremented by 1.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`j` is less than `en + 2`, `s` is a list, `word` is a string, `tem` is the sum of elements in `a` where the corresponding element in `s` matches the `i`-th character of `word`, `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, `be` is increased by 2, `en` is `n`, `tem` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, and `cur` is less than `i`**
