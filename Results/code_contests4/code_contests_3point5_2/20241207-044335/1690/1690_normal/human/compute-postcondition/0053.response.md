Example Answer:
`tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` of list `a`. The previous values of `tem` and `a` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `be`, `en` are equal to `n`, for the loop to execute properly. `s` is a list, `word` is a string. The element at index `j` of list `s` is equal to the `i`-th character of string `word`. `tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` of list `a`.
Output State: **`j`, `be`, `en` are equal to `n`, for the loop to execute properly. `s` is a list, `word` is a string. The element at index `j` of list `s` is equal to the `i`-th character of string `word`. `tem` is incremented by the value at index `j` of list `a`**
