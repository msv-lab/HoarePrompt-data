The function defines lambda functions for reading input, initializes variables, and then iterates through a nested loop to manipulate and calculate values. It updates the `ans` variable to the minimum of `tem` in each iteration. Finally, it prints the minimum calculated value of `tem`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.
