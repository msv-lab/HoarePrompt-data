Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description correctly. It calculates the minimum ambiguity of the statement by trying all possible subsequences of "hard" in the given string. It iterates through all possible starting and ending positions of "hard" in the string, calculates the ambiguity for each subsequence, and keeps track of the minimum ambiguity found. Finally, it prints the minimum ambiguity. This approach ensures that the program accurately determines the minimum ambiguity required to make the statement easy.
