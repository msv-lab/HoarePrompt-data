Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum ambiguity of the statement after Vasya deletes some characters so that the resulting statement is easy. It iterates through a nested loop to find the minimum ambiguity for each possible subsequence of the word "hard". The program considers all possible cases and correctly updates the `ans` variable to the minimum ambiguity calculated in each iteration. Finally, it prints the minimum ambiguity obtained.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
