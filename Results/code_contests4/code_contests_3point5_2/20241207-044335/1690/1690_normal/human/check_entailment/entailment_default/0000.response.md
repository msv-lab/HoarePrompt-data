Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the length of the statement, the statement itself, and the ambiguity values as input.
- It then iterates through a nested loop to find the minimum ambiguity by removing characters to make the statement easy.
- The code correctly handles the scenario where the statement contains the subsequence "hard" and calculates the minimum ambiguity required to make it easy.
- It effectively considers the ambiguity values associated with each character and updates the minimum ambiguity accordingly.
- The output of the code provides the minimum possible ambiguity of the statement after removing characters.
- The code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, providing the correct output based on the given examples.
