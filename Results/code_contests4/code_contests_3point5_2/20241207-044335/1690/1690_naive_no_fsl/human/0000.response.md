Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, iterates over the characters in the given string to find the minimum ambiguity by removing characters to make the statement easy. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description provided. The program iterates over all possible combinations of removing characters and calculates the ambiguity for each combination, finally outputting the minimum ambiguity. Since the program covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately, it can be considered correct.
