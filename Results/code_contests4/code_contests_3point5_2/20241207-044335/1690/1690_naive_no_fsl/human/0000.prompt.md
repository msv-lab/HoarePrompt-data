You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is preparing a contest, and now he has written a statement for an easy problem. The statement is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin latters. Vasya thinks that the statement can be considered hard if it contains a subsequence hard; otherwise the statement is easy. For example, hard, hzazrzd, haaaaard can be considered hard statements, while har, hart and drah are easy statements. 

Vasya doesn't want the statement to be hard. He may remove some characters from the statement in order to make it easy. But, of course, some parts of the statement can be crucial to understanding. Initially the ambiguity of the statement is 0, and removing i-th character increases the ambiguity by a_i (the index of each character is considered as it was in the original statement, so, for example, if you delete character r from hard, and then character d, the index of d is still 4 even though you delete it from the string had).

Vasya wants to calculate the minimum ambiguity of the statement, if he removes some characters (possibly zero) so that the statement is easy. Help him to do it!

Recall that subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the statement.

The second line contains one string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters — the statement written by Vasya.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 998244353).

Output

Print minimum possible ambiguity of the statement after Vasya deletes some (possibly zero) characters so the resulting statement is easy.

Examples

Input


6
hhardh
3 2 9 11 7 1


Output


5


Input


8
hhzarwde
3 2 6 9 4 8 7 1


Output


4


Input


6
hhaarr
1 2 3 4 5 6


Output


0

Note

In the first example, first two characters are removed so the result is ardh.

In the second example, 5-th character is removed so the result is hhzawde.

In the third example there's no need to remove anything.
Program:
```
rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(n, s, a, ans, word) = (int(input()), rstr(), rints(), float('inf'), 'hard')
for i in range(4):
    (be, en, tem) = (0, n, 0)
    cur = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if cur == i:
            break
        elif s[j] == word[cur]:
            cur += 1
        be += 1
    cur = 3
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cur == i:
            break
        elif s[j] == word[cur]:
            cur -= 1
        en -= 1
    for j in range(be, en):
        if s[j] == word[i]:
            tem += a[j]
    ans = min(ans, tem)
print(ans)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
