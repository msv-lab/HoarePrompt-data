Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of stones the cheater will eat to guarantee a win in the Nim game. It calculates the maximum number of bits required to represent the maximum element in the given piles. Then, it iterates through each pile, calculates the bit representation, and updates the count of 1s at each bit position. After that, it calculates the XOR of all the elements to find the winning strategy. The program then iterates through the XOR result and checks if there are enough stones to remove in each bit position to guarantee a win. If there are not enough stones, it prints -1, otherwise, it calculates the number of stones to eat for a win. The logic provided in the code covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correctness of the program.
