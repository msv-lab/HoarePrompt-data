Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of stones the cheater will eat in order to win the game of Nim. The program first calculates the maximum length of the binary representation of the input numbers, then proceeds to count the number of set bits at each position in the binary representation. It then calculates the XOR of all the input numbers and iterates to find the number of stones the cheater needs to eat to ensure victory.

The program covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately. It handles the scenario where the cheater cannot win the game even with cheating by checking if the XOR of all input numbers is zero. In such cases, it correctly prints `-1`.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem description, the program can be deemed correct.
