Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1, so `ans` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1. The character at index `i` in `axor` is '1'. The value of `cnt[i]` is not 0.
Output State: **`axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1. The character at index `i` in `axor` is '1'. The value of `cnt[i]` is not 0.**
