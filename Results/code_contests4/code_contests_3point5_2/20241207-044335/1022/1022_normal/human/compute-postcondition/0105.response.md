Output State: **`axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 3, `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1, `tmp` is assigned the integer value of a binary string consisting of 1's with a length of `la - i - 1`, `axor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the integer value of `axor` and `tmp`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
