According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is within the range specified by `xrange(lb - 1, -1, -1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is -1. 
So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range specified by `xrange(lb - 1, -1, -1)` which means `j` should be greater than -1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 and program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
