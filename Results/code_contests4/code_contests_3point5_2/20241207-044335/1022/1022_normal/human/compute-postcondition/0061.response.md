Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` has values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a` for all elements in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a` without the prefix '0b', `lb` is the length of `bit`, `i` is equal to n+1, `j` is less than 0.**
