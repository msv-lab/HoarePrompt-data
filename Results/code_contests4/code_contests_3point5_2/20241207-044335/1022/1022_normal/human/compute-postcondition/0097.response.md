Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3**
