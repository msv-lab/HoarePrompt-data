Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 and program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `bit[j]` is '1', then the value at `cnt[lb - 1 - j]` is incremented.***
