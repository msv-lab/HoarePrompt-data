Postcondition: ***`axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `i` is 4, and `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `cnt[4]` is 0, the program exits. Otherwise, `axor` is a string representing the binary value of the previous integer result from the XOR operation with `tmp`, `la` is 1, `i` is 4, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3, `cnt[4]` is decreased by 1, exited the most internal loop or if statement, `tmp` is assigned the integer value of a binary string '1' repeated (la - i - 1) times.***
