Example Answer:
The `print(-1)` statement will output -1 to the console. The variables `axor`, `la`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `i` is 4, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2.
Output State: **`axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `i` is 4, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2**
