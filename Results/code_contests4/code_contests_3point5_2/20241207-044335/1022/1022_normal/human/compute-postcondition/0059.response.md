Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` has values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - (j+1)` based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a` without the prefix '0b', `lb` is the length of `bit`, `i` is less than n+1, `lb` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0, updated values in `cnt` at specific indexes based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`. The loop or if statement we were directly inside is terminated.**
