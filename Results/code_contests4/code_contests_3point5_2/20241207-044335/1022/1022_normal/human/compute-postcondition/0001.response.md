Example Answer:
The list `a` is created by taking `n` inputs and converting them to integers. Since `n` is an input integer, `a` will contain `n` integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers**
