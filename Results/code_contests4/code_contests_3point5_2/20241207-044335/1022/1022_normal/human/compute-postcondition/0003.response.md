According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mxlba` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
