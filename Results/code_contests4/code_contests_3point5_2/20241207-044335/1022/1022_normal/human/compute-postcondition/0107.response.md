Postcondition: ***`axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `cnt[i] == 0`, no changes are made to the variables. If the else part is executed, `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1, `tmp` is the integer value of a binary string with length of `la - i - 1`, `axor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the integer value of `axor` and `tmp`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
