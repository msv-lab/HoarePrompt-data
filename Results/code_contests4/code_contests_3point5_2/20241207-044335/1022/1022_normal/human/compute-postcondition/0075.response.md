Example Answer:
`axor` is converted to a binary string using the `bin()` function and the binary representation is stored in `axor`. As `axor` is still equal to 0, the binary representation of 0 is '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is a binary string '0'.
Output State: **`axor` is a binary string '0'**
