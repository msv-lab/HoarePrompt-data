Example Answer: 
The value of `tmp` is calculated by converting a binary string of '1' repeated `(la - i - 1)` times into an integer. In this case, the binary string is '1' and `(la - i - 1)` is 0. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the integer value 1. The variable `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1. The program does not exit the innermost loop or if statement as `(la - i - 1)` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` in `axor` is '1', `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1, and `tmp` is 1.
Output State: **`axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` in `axor` is '1', `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1, `tmp` is 1**
