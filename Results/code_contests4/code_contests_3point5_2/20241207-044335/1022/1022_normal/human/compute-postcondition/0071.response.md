Postcondition: ***After the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values representing the count of '1's at each position from right to left in the binary representations of all integers in list `a` based on the respective positions in the binary representations, and `axor` is the result of bitwise XOR operation on all elements of list `a`. Additionally, `axor` is equal to 0***
