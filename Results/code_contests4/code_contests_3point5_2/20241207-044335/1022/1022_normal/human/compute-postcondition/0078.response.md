Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the value -1. The value of `i` is now -1, so after execution, `i` is -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1.
Output State: **`axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1**
