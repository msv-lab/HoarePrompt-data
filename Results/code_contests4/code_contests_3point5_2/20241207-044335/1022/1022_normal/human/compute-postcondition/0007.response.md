According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` has been updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the length of the binary representation of `a[i]`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `i` must be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the length of the binary representation of `a[i]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n`**
