According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `la`. If `i` is less than `la`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `la` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, i.e., `i` is 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2**
