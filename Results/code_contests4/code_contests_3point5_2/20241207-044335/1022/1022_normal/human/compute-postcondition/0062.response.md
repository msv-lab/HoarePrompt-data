Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values representing the count of '1's at each position from right to left in the binary representations of all integers in list `a` based on the respective positions in the binary representations. The loop has iterated through all elements in list `a` and updated `cnt` accordingly.**
