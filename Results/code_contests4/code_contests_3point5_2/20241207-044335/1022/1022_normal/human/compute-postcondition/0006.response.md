Example Answer:
`mxlba` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the length of the binary representation of `a[i]`, where `i` starts at 1. The binary representation of `a[i]` is obtained by using `bin(a[i])[2:]`. Since `n` is an input integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers, the loop can only execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the length of the binary representation of `a[i]`, `i` is 1.**
