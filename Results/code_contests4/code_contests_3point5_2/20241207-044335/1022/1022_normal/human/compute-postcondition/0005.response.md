According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum value between its current value and the length of the binary representation of `a[i]`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum value between its current value and the length of the binary representation of `a[i]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
