According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `la`. If `i` is less than `la`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is -1, `la` is 1. In this case, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `la`, so `i` needs to be changed to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
