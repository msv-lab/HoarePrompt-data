According to the code, the loop can execute if `lb` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 and `lb` is assigned the length of `bit` ensures the loop can execute. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `i` is less than `n+1, `lb` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is equal to `lb - 1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1, `lb` is assigned the length of `bit`, `j` is equal to `lb - 1**.
