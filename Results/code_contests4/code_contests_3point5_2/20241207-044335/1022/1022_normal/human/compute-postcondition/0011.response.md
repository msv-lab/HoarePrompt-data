According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers
- `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`
- `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5`**
