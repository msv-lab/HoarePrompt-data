Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than n+1. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `cnt` will be the count of '1's at each position from right to left in the binary representations of all integers in list `a` based on the respective positions in the binary representations.**
