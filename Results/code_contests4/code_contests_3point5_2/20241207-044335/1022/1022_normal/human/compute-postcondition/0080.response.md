Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`axor` is a binary string '0', `la` is 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
