Postcondition: ***`axor` is a binary string, `la` is 1, `i` is 3, and `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `axor[i] == '1'`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `cnt[i]` is decreased by 1, `tmp` is the integer value of a binary string with length of `la - i - 1`, and `axor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the integer value of `axor` and `tmp`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
