According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` should be less than `n+1` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1`.**
