Based on the code snippet provided and the given initial state, the next iteration of the loop requires the following adjustments at the start:

State: **After the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values representing the count of '1's at each position from right to left in the binary representations of all integers in list `a` based on the respective positions in the binary representations, and `axor` is the result of bitwise XOR operation on all elements of list `a`.**
