Output State: **After the program exits, all variables retain their initial values: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values representing the count of '1's at each position from right to left in the binary representations of all integers in list `a`, `axor` is the result of bitwise XOR operation on all elements of list `a`, and `axor` is still equal to 0.**
