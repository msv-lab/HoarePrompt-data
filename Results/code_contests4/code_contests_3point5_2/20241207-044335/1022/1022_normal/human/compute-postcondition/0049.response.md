Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than n+1, `bit` is assigned the binary representation of `a[i]` without the prefix '0b', `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute `lb` must be greater than 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the `j-th` element of `bit` is equal to '1'.***
