Output State: **`axor` is an integer resulting from the XOR operation of the integer value of the binary string `axor` and `tmp`, `la` is 1, `i` is 4, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3, `cnt[4]` is decreased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `tmp` is assigned the integer value of a binary string '1' repeated (la - i - 1) times.**
