Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than n+1, `j` is equal to `lb - 2`, and if the j-th element of `bit` is '1', then the value at position `lb - 2 - j` in list `cnt` must be incremented by 1 based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`**
