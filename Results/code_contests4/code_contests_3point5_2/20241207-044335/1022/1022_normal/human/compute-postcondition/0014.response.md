According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `lb` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the conditions need to be adjusted to execute the loop:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list of zeros with a length of `mxlba + 5, `bit` is the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit` is greater than or equal to 1**
