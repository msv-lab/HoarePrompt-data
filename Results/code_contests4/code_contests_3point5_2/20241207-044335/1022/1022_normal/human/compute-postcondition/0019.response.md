According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `lb`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `lb` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be -1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` is a list with values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the `i-th` element in list `a`, `lb` is the length of `bit` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is -1**
