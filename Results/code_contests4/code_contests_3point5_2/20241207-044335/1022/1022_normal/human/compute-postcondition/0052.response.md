Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers, `mxlba` is the maximum length of the binary representation of any integer in list `a`, `cnt` has values incremented at positions `lb - 1 - j` based on the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a`, `bit` is the binary representation of the i-th element in list `a` without the prefix '0b', `lb` is the length of `bit`, `i` must be less than n+1 for the loop to execute one more time, `lb` must be greater than 0, and if the `j-th` element of `bit` is equal to '1', then a specific condition is met.***
