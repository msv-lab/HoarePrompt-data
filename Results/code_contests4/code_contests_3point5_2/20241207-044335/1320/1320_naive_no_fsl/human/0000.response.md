Correctness: False

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem related to finding the number of beautiful years between a range of years, but it is not implemented correctly. The program is not handling the input format specified in the problem description, and the logic inside the `func_8` function does not seem to match the requirements of the original problem.

Additionally, the input format in the program does not match the input format specified in the problem description. The program needs to handle multiple test cases with each test case consisting of a single positive integer `n`, representing the age of Polycarp. The program, however, is reading multiple integers in each test case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description.
