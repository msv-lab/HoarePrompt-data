def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string and prints the string to the standard output. No additional functionality is provided in the code or annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, converts it to a string, and prints it to the standard output followed by a newline character. The annotations lack information about the relationship between the input parameter `s` and the return value.

def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained by reading input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user and returns the integer value obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers obtained by splitting the input read line, converted to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input test cases and returns a map object containing the integers obtained by splitting the input read line, converted to integers. The function does not take any parameters explicitly, but it is assumed to read input from the standard input. It does not handle any error cases or validation for the input format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It generates `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function returns the positive integer `n` for each test case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to generate `t` test cases with a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns the list of strings after splitting the input read line by whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user and splits the input read line by whitespace. It returns the list of strings obtained after splitting. The function does not explicitly mention handling the conversion of input strings to integers or checking for valid input ranges, such as ensuring n is within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). It also does not mention any error handling mechanisms in case the input format is incorrect.

def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`debug` is a boolean variable. If `debug` is true, then the program executes certain debugging actions. Otherwise, no actions are taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not have a predefined output. If the boolean variable `debug` is true, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it does not perform any action. The function serves as a debugging tool when `debug` is true.

def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns the value calculated by taking the maximum value of list `X` minus the minimum value of list `X`, subtracting 2 from the result, and then doubling the result. If the calculated value is less than 0, it returns 0. The initial values of `minX` and `maxX` are unknown.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `X`, which is a list. It calculates a value by taking the maximum value of list `X` minus the minimum value of list `X`, subtracting 2 from the result, and then doubling the result. If the calculated value is less than 0, it returns 0. The initial values of `minX` and `maxX` are unknown. The function does not handle cases where the list `X` is empty or contains only one element. If `X` is empty, it should return 0 as there are no elements to calculate the maximum and minimum values. If `X` has only one element, it should return 0 since the difference between the maximum and minimum of a single element is 0.
