You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output

Print t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.

Note

In the first test case of the example beautiful years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string and prints the string to the standard output. No additional functionality is provided in the code or annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, converts it to a string, and prints it to the standard output followed by a newline character. The annotations lack information about the relationship between the input parameter `s` and the return value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return int(readln())
    #The program returns an integer value obtained by reading input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user and returns the integer value obtained.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers obtained by splitting the input read line, converted to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input test cases and returns a map object containing the integers obtained by splitting the input read line, converted to integers. The function does not take any parameters explicitly, but it is assumed to read input from the standard input. It does not handle any error cases or validation for the input format.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func_5():
    return readln()
    #The program returns the positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It generates `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function returns the positive integer `n` for each test case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to generate `t` test cases with a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each case.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns the list of strings after splitting the input read line by whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user and splits the input read line by whitespace. It returns the list of strings obtained after splitting. The function does not explicitly mention handling the conversion of input strings to integers or checking for valid input ranges, such as ensuring n is within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). It also does not mention any error handling mechanisms in case the input format is incorrect.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`debug` is a boolean variable. If `debug` is true, then the program executes certain debugging actions. Otherwise, no actions are taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not have a predefined output. If the boolean variable `debug` is true, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it does not perform any action. The function serves as a debugging tool when `debug` is true.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8(X):
    minX = min(X)
    maxX = max(X)
    return max(0, (maxX - minX - 2) * 2)
    #The program returns the value calculated by taking the maximum value of list `X` minus the minimum value of list `X`, subtracting 2 from the result, and then doubling the result. If the calculated value is less than 0, it returns 0. The initial values of `minX` and `maxX` are unknown.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `X`, which is a list. It calculates a value by taking the maximum value of list `X` minus the minimum value of list `X`, subtracting 2 from the result, and then doubling the result. If the calculated value is less than 0, it returns 0. The initial values of `minX` and `maxX` are unknown. The function does not handle cases where the list `X` is empty or contains only one element. If `X` is empty, it should return 0 as there are no elements to calculate the maximum and minimum values. If `X` has only one element, it should return 0 since the difference between the maximum and minimum of a single element is 0.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
