Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not align with the problem description for every potential case. The code does not contain the actual implementation of the problem described, which involves counting the number of beautiful numbers between 1 and n (inclusive). The code consists of function definitions that do not relate to the problem description, such as reading input, printing output, and calculating values from a list. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not solve the specified problem.
