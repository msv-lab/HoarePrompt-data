The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It generates `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function returns the positive integer `n` for each test case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to generate `t` test cases with a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) for each case.
