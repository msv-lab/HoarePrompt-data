The function reads input from the user and splits the input read line by whitespace. It returns the list of strings obtained after splitting. The function does not explicitly mention handling the conversion of input strings to integers or checking for valid input ranges, such as ensuring n is within the specified bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). It also does not mention any error handling mechanisms in case the input format is incorrect.
