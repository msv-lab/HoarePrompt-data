Example Answer:
`maxX` is assigned the maximum value of list `X`, but the values of `X` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `minX` is the minimum value of list `X`, but the values of `X` are unknown; `maxX` is the maximum value of list `X`, but the values of `X` are unknown.
Output State: **`minX` is the minimum value of list `X`, but the values of `X` are unknown; `maxX` is the maximum value of list `X`, but the values of `X` are unknown.**
