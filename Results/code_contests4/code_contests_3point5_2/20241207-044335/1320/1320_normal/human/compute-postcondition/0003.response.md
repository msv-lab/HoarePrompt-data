The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `X`, which is a list. The program calculates the value by taking the maximum value of list `X` minus the minimum value of list `X`, subtracting 2 from the result, and then doubling the result. If the calculated value is less than 0, it returns 0. The initial values of `minX` and `maxX` are unknown. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a list `X`, calculate a value based on the maximum and minimum values of the list, and return the result after applying the specified operations. If the calculated value is less than 0, it returns 0.
