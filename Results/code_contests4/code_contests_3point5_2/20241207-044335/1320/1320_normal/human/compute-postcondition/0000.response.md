Example Answer:
The variable `minX` is assigned the minimum value of the list `X`. The value of `X` is not provided in the initial state, so the calculation of `minX` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `minX` is the minimum value of list `X`, but the values of `X` are unknown.
Output State: **`minX` is the minimum value of list `X`, but the values of `X` are unknown**
