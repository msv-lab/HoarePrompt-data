The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `X`, which is a list. It calculates a value by taking the maximum value of list `X` minus the minimum value of list `X`, subtracting 2 from the result, and then doubling the result. If the calculated value is less than 0, it returns 0. The initial values of `minX` and `maxX` are unknown. The function does not handle cases where the list `X` is empty or contains only one element. If `X` is empty, it should return 0 as there are no elements to calculate the maximum and minimum values. If `X` has only one element, it should return 0 since the difference between the maximum and minimum of a single element is 0.
