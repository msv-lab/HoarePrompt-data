Correctness: **False**

The given program does not solve the problem described in the problem statement about counting the number of beautiful years. Instead, it seems to be solving a different problem related to finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list of integers. The functions defined in the program do not match the requirements of the problem description, and the output produced does not correspond to the expected output of counting beautiful years.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
