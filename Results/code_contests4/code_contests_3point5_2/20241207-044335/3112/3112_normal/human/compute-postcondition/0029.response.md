Example Answer: 
The value of `maxi` is decreased by 2, and then the character corresponding to the index `maxi` in the string 'RPS' is printed `len(S)` times. 
The variables `range`, `input`, `mapper`, `t`, `S`, `count`, `maxi` are not affected by this code snippet.
Therefore, the Output State is: `range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `S` is a list of elements, `count` is a list containing the updated counts after incrementing the value at index `s` for each element in `S`, `maxi` is decreased by 2.
Output State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `S` is a list of elements, `count` is a list containing the updated counts after incrementing the value at index `s` for each element in `S`, `maxi` is decreased by 2**
