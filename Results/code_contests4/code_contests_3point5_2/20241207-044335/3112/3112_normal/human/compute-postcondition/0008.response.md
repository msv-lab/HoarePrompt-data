Example Answer: 
`count[s]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `s` is the first element in the list `S`, so `count[s]` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `S` has at least 1 element, `s` is the first element in the list `S`, `count` is a list containing the updated counts after incrementing `count[s]` by 1.
Output State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `S` has at least 1 element, `s` is the first element in the list `S`, `count` is a list containing the updated counts after incrementing `count[s]` by 1**
