According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop does not depend on any other variables or conditions, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute**
