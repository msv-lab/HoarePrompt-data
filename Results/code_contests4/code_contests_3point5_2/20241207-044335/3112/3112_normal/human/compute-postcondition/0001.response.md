Example Answer: 
`input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, which is a function in Python 2 that reads input as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`.
Output State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`**
