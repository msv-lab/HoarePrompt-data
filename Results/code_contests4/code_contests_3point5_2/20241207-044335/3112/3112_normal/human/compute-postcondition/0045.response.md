Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values according to predefined constraints and relationships. It then processes the input characters 'R', 'P', 'S' into a count array and determines the maximum count character to output 'R', 'P', or 'S' accordingly. However, the actual logic of the code seems to have some issues, such as the incorrect calculation of the `maxi` value and the multiplication with `len(S)` when printing the output. These discrepancies should be addressed for the correct functionality of the function. **
