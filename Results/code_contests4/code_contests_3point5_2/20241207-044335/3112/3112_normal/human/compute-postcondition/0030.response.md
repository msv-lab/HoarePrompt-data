According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `_` needs to be increased by 1. Additionally, `maxi` is decreased by 2 at the end of the last iteration, so `maxi` needs to be increased by 2 to revert the decrement.
State: **`range` is assigned the value `xrange`, `input` is assigned the value `raw_input`, `mapper` is a dictionary mapping 'R' to 0, 'P' to 1, and 'S' to 2, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, `S` is a list of elements, `count` is a list containing the updated counts after incrementing the value at index `s` for each element in `S`, `maxi` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute the next time `_` must be less than `t`**
