Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The calculation of `maxi` is incorrect as it subtracts 2 from the maximum count index, which is not needed. Additionally, the multiplication with `len(S)` when printing the output is also incorrect. These issues prevent the program from correctly determining the optimal choices to maximize the average number of wins as described in the problem. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
