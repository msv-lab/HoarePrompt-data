Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention discrepancies in the code such as the incorrect calculation of the `maxi` value and the multiplication with `len(S)` when printing the output. These issues can lead to incorrect choices being made for the rounds, affecting the average number of wins. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
