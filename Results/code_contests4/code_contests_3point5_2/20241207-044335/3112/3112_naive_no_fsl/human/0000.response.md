Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The program calculates the most frequent choice made by the bot and then tries to counter that choice. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible average number of wins as described in the problem.

An example where the program fails:
Input:
```
1
RSP
```
Expected Output:
```
PSR
```
Explanation:
- If the bot starts from pos = 1, then c_1 = P, c_2 = S, c_3 = R
- If the bot starts from pos = 2, then c_1 = S, c_2 = R, c_3 = P
- If the bot starts from pos = 3, then c_1 = R, c_2 = P, c_3 = S

In all cases, the average number of wins will be 2, which is the maximum possible average. However, the program provided does not produce this optimal output.
