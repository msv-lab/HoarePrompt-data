Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values and separates the even and odd indices into separate lists.
- It then uses Counter from collections module to count the occurrences of each number in the even and odd lists.
- It then finds the most common elements in both lists, ensuring there are exactly two different numbers appearing in the sequence.
- The program calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be replaced to make the sequence /\//\//\, taking into account the occurrences of the two different numbers.
- The logic of the program seems correct and covers all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
