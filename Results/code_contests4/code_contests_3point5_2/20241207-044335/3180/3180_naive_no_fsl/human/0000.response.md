Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the given sequence is already /\/\/\/ as per the problem description. In such cases, the program should output 0, but the given code will not handle this scenario correctly. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1 2 1 2
```

The correct output should be 0, but the program will output 2 as it does not consider the case where the sequence is already in the required format.
