Postcondition: ***`m` is a list containing the result of `a + b`, `i` is valid, and `j` is 2. If the first element of `evenc_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common` at index 2, then `b` is calculated as the length of `odd` list minus the second element of the `oddc_most_common` list at index 2.***
