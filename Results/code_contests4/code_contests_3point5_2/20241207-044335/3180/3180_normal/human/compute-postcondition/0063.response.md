Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `m` contains the result of `a + b` appended at the end for each iteration where `evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]`. If the condition `evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]` is false for all iterations, then `m` remains the same as the initial state.**
