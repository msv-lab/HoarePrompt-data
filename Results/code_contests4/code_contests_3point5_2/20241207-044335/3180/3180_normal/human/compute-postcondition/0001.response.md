Example Answer:
The error is due to the fact that 'raw_input' is not defined in Python 3, it was used in Python 2. Therefore, the code will not execute correctly. The initial state remains the same as Error - NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined.
Output State: **Error - NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined**
