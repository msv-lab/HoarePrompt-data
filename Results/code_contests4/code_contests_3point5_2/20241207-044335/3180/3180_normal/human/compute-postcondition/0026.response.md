Output State: **`m` is a list containing the result of `a + b` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is valid, and `j` ranges from 0 to 2. If the first element of `evenc_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common` at index `j`, then `a` is calculated as the length of `even` list minus the second element of `evenc_most_common` list at index `i`, and `b` is calculated as the length of `odd` list minus the second element of the `oddc_most_common` list at index `j`.**
