Postcondition: ***`m` is a list containing the result of `a + b`, `i` is valid, and `j` ranges from 0 to 2. If the first element of `evenc_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `oddc_most_common` at index `j`, then `a` is assigned the value of the result of subtracting the second element of `evenc_most_common[i]` from the length of `even` and `b` is assigned the value of the result of subtracting the length of `odd` from the second element of `oddc_most_common[j]`.***
