Output State: **`m` is a list containing the result of `a + b` appended at the end for each iteration where `evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]`, `i` is valid, `j` ranges from 0 to 2, the first element of `even_most_common` at index `i` is equal to the first element of `odd_most_common` at index `j`. If the condition `evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]` is false for all iterations, then `m` remains the same as the initial state, and no changes occur in other variables.**
