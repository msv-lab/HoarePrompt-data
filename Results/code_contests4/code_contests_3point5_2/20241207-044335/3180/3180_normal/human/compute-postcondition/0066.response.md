Functionality: **The function reads an integer n and a list of integers v. It then separates the elements of v into even and odd indexed lists, counts the occurrences of each value in the lists, finds the most common values in each list, and calculates the difference between the total number of elements and the frequency of the most common values. Finally, it prints the minimum sum of these differences.**
