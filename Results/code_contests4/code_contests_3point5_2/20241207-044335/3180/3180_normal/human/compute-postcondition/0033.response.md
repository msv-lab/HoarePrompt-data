Postcondition: ***`m` is a list containing the result of `a + b` appended at the end, `i` is valid, `j` ranges from 0 to 1, the first element of `even_most_common` at index `i` is equal to the first element of `odd_most_common` at index `j`, if the first element of `even_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `odd_most_common` at index `j`, then `m` will have the result of `a + b` appended at the end, where `a` is the difference between the length of the list `even` and the frequency value of the first element of `even_most_common` at index `i`, and `b` is the difference between the length of the list `odd` and the frequency value of the first element of `odd_most_common` at index `j`.***
