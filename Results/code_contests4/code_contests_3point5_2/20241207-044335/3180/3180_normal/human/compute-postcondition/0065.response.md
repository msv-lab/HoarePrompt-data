The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of all the integers provided in the input parameters v_1, v_2, ..., v_n, where n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2. The integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are between 1 and 10^5. The function returns the sum of these integers as the output.
