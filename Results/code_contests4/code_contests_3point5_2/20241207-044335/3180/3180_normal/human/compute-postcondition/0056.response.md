Postcondition: ***`m` contains the result of `a + b` appended at the end for each iteration where `evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]`, `i` is valid and has been incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and the condition `evenc_most_common[i][0] != oddc_most_common[j][0]` is satisfied. `a` is assigned the value of `len(even) - evenc_most_common[i][1]`, `b` is assigned the value of `len(odd) - oddc_most_common[j][1`.***
