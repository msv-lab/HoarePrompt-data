Output State: **`m` is a list containing the result of `a + b` appended at the end, `i` is valid, `j` ranges from 0 to 1, the first element of `even_most_common` at index `i` is equal to the first element of `odd_most_common` at index `j`, the first element of `even_most_common` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `odd_most_common` at index `j`, `a` is assigned the value of `len(even) - even_most_common[i][1]`, `b` is assigned the value of `len(odd) - odd_most_common[j][1]`**
