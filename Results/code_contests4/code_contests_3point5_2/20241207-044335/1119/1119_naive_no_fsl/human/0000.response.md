- The program correctly reads the input values for the size of the field and the banned cells.
- It correctly initializes the variables and lists needed for the calculations.
- It correctly marks the banned cells as invalid for placing chips.
- The loop iterates over the cells and checks if the row and column are valid for placing chips.
- It calculates the maximum points that can be earned based on the valid cells and conditions specified in the problem description.
- Finally, it prints the maximum points that Gerald can earn, which aligns with the problem requirements.
- The logic of the program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that Gerald can earn the most points by placing chips on valid cells without violating any of the losing conditions.
