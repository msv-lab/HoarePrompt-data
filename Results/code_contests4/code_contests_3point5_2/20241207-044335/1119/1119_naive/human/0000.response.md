Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates and prints the maximum number of points Gerald can earn in the game following the rules described in the problem statement. The program considers banned cells and ensures that chips are placed on the border cells in such a way that none of the losing conditions are violated. It iterates through the banned cells and updates the rows and columns where chips cannot be placed. Then, it calculates the maximum number of points based on the available border cells. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem. Overall, the program appears to be correct.
