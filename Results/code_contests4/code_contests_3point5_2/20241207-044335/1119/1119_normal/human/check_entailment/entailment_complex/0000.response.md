Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for `n` and `m`, initializes lists `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans`, updates `r` and `c` based on the banned cell coordinates, calculates `ans` by summing specific elements from `r` and `c`, and increments `ans` by 1 if `n` is odd and a specific condition is met. The final value of `ans` is then printed. This aligns with the problem description and ensures that Gerald earns the maximum points based on the given conditions. The program covers all cases where Gerald would lose and correctly calculates the maximum points he can earn.
