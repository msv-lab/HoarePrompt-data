Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n` and `m`, initializes the lists `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` as described in the problem description.
- It updates the lists `r` and `c` based on the banned cell coordinates.
- The code then calculates the maximum number of points Gerald can earn by summing specific elements from `r` and `c`, considering the constraints given in the problem description.
- If `n` is odd and a specific condition is met, the code increments the `ans` by 1.
- Finally, the code prints the final value of `ans` which represents the maximum points Gerald can earn in the game.
- The code covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario.
