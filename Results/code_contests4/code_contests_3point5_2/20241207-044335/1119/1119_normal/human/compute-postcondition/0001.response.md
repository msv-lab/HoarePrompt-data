Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by `rints()`. Since the initial state of `n` and `m` is not provided, the values after execution will be dependent on the implementation of `rints()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged**
