Output State: `ban` is a list of length `m` with all elements updated, `r` is a list of length `n+1` with the first element as 0 and the rest filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n+1` with the second element as 0 and the rest filled with 1s, `ans` has been increased by the sum of `r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1`, `i` is 3, `(n - 2) // 2` is greater than 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
