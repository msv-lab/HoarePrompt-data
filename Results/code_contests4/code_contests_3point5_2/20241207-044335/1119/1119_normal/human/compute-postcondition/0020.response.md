Output State: **`ban` is a list of length `m` with all elements updated, `r` is a list of length `n+1` with the first element as 0 and the rest filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n+1` with the second element as 0 and the rest filled with 1s, `ans` has been increased by the sum of `r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]` for all valid `i` values in the loop, `i` is at least 2, `(n - 2) // 2` is positive, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `n` is odd and either `r[(n + 1) // 2]` or `c[(n + 1) // 2]` is non-zero, `ans` is increased by 1.**
