According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ban`. If the list `ban` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `ans` is 0, so it does not affect the loop execution. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `ban` must have at least 1 element, and `(x, y)` should represent the first element in the list.
State: **`ban` is a list of length `m` with at least 1 element, `r` is a list of length `n+1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n+1` filled with 1s, `ans` is 0, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `(x, y)` represents the first element in `ban`**
