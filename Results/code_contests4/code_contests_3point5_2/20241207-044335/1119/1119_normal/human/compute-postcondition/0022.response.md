Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `m`, initializes lists `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans`, where `ban` represents banned cell coordinates, `r` and `c` are lists with constraints, and `ans` is set to 0. It then updates `r` and `c` based on the banned cell coordinates. After that, it calculates `ans` by summing specific elements from `r` and `c`. If `n` is odd and a specific condition is met, `ans` is incremented by 1. The function then prints the final value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
