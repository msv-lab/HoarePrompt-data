Example Answer:
The code creates a list `ban` of length `m`, filled with values returned by the function `rints()`. It also initializes lists `r` and `c` with values of 1 up to `n+1`, and initializes `ans` to 0. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`ban` is a list of length `m`, `r` is a list of length `n+1` filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n+1` filled with 1s, `ans` is 0, `n` and `m` remain unchanged**
