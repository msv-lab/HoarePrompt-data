According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `(n - 2) // 2 + 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `(n - 2) // 2` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 3.
State: **Output State: `ban` is a list of length `m` with all elements updated, `r` is a list of length `n+1` with the first element as 0 and the rest filled with 1s, `c` is a list of length `n+1` with the second element as 0 and the rest filled with 1s, `ans` has been increased by the sum of `r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1`, `i` is 3, `(n - 2) // 2` is greater than 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
