Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads pairs of a word and a page number and stores them in a dictionary where each word is a key mapping to a list of corresponding page numbers. This aligns with the problem description.
- The code then prints each word followed by its associated page numbers in sorted order. This is in line with the problem description which requires the words to be printed in alphabetical order and the page numbers in ascending order.
- The code handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description such as the word consisting of at most 30 characters, the page number being less than or equal to 1000, and the number of pairs being less than or equal to 100.
- There are no edge cases identified that the code does not handle as the code structure aligns with the problem requirements. 

Therefore, based on the code functionality and the problem description, the correctness of the code is **True**.
