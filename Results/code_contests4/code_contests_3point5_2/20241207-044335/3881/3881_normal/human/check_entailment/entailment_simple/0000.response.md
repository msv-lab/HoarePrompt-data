Correctness: **True**

The program reads pairs of words and page numbers, stores them in a dictionary where each word is a key and the corresponding page numbers are stored in a list. It then prints the words in alphabetical order and their corresponding page numbers in ascending order, as required by the problem description. The program correctly handles the input constraints and ensures that each word is printed only once along with its corresponding page numbers. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
