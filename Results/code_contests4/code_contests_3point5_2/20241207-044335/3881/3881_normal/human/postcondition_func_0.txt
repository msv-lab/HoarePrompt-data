The function `func_1` processes pairs of words and page numbers from the input stream. It stores these pairs in a dictionary `index`, where each word is a key mapping to a list of corresponding page numbers. After processing, it prints each word followed by its associated page numbers in sorted order. The function does not accept any parameters and terminates after printing the processed data.
