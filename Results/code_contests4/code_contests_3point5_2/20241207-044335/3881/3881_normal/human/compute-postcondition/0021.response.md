Example Answer:
The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program. Since the function is called, no further execution takes place, and the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All integers in the lists corresponding to the keys in `index` are printed in sorted order.
Output State: **All integers in the lists corresponding to the keys in `index` are printed in sorted order**
