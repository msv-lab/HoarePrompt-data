According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `index`. If there are more words in the `index`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more words in the `index` list.
State: **The integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order, for the loop to execute another time there must be more words in the `index` list**
