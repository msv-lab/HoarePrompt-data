Example Answer:
The integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order. The loop must execute another time as there are more words in the `index` list. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order, the loop will execute another time.
Output State: **The integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order, the loop will execute another time**
