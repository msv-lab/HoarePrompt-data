Example Answer: 
The code appends the integer value of `page` to the list stored at the key `word` in the `index` defaultdict. The variables `index`, `word`, and `page` are affected by this operation. The output state after execution is: `index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it.
Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it**
