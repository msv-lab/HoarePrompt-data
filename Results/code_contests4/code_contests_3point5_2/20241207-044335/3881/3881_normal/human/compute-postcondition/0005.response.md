Example Answer:
`word` is assigned the first element of the split line, and `page` is assigned the second element of the split line. The split method splits the line based on whitespace. The values of `word` and `page` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it, there is more input available from stdin, `word` and `page` are assigned values based on the input line split.
Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it, there is more input available from stdin, `word` and `page` are assigned values based on the input line split**
