According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sorted order of keys in the `index` defaultdict. If the `index` dictionary has at least 1 key, the loop will execute. The state needs to be adjusted so that the loop can execute the first time with the first key in the sorted order of keys in the `index` defaultdict. Additionally, after the first iteration, the `page` integer value corresponding to the `word` key should be appended to the list stored at that key.
State: **`index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where each list at key `word` contains all the integer values of `page` appended to it after each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `index` has at least 1 key, `word` is the first key in the sorted order of keys in the `index` defaultdict**
