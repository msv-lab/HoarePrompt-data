According to the code, whether the loop can execute another time depends on the variables `word` and `index`. The loop will execute another time if there are more elements left in the sorted `index` list. At the end of the last iteration, the integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element left in the sorted `index` list.
State: **The integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order, for the loop to execute another time, there must be at least one more element left in the sorted `index` list**
