Example Answer:
The code appends the integer value `page` to the list stored at key `word` in the `index` defaultdict. The values of `word` and `page` are assigned from `line.split()`. Therefore, after execution, the list at key `word` in `index` will have the integer value `page` appended to it.
Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it, `word` and `page` are assigned values from `line.split()`**
