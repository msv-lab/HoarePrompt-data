Example Answer:
The code appends the integer value `page` to the list stored at key `word` in the `index` defaultdict. The values of `word` and `page` are based on the input line split. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it.
Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it**
