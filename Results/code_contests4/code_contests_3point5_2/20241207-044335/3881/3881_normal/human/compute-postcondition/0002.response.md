Example Answer:
`word` and `page` are assigned values from splitting the `line`. The `line` is read from standard input. Therefore, the output state is: `index` is a defaultdict that can store lists, `word` and `page` are assigned values from splitting the `line`.
Output State: **`index` is a defaultdict that can store lists, `word` and `page` are assigned values from splitting the `line`**
