According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If there is more input available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `index` defaultdict has been modified to store lists with integer values. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input available from stdin.
State: **`index` is a defaultdict that can store lists where the list at key `word` has the integer value `page` appended to it, there is more input available from stdin**
