Example Answer:
The integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order. The sorted list is printed using the `print(*...)` syntax. For the loop to execute another time, there must be at least one more element left in the sorted `index` list. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **The integers in the list corresponding to the key `word` in `index` are printed in sorted order, for the loop to execute another time, there must be at least one more element left in the sorted `index` list.**
