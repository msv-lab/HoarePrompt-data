Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads a list of pairs of a word and a page number, then stores them in a dictionary where the word is the key and the page numbers are stored in a list. It then prints the words in alphabetical order and the corresponding page numbers in ascending order, as required by the problem description. The program correctly handles the input constraints and the expected output format.
