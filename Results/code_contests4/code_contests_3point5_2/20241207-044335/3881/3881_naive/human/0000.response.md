Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads pairs of words and page numbers from the input.
2. It stores the page numbers corresponding to each word in a dictionary using the word as the key.
3. It then prints the words in alphabetical order and the corresponding page numbers in ascending order.
4. The program uses the `sorted` function to ensure the correct order of words and page numbers.
5. The program handles the case where a word appears multiple times with different page numbers by appending the page numbers to the list corresponding to that word in the dictionary.
