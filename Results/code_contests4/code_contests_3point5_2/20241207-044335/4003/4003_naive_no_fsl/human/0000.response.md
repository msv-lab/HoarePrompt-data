Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the issues:
1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.
2. The program is trying to iterate over the input values as if they are integers, but `testSNs` is a list of strings after splitting the input. This will result in a `TypeError`.
3. The program is not correctly checking if the sum of A and B is 10 or greater. Instead, it is checking if each individual input is divisible by 10, which is not relevant to the problem description.
4. The program is not printing the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
