The function `func` reads an input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings, and initializes a variable `SCORE` to 0. It then iterates through the elements of the list, summing up those elements where the last digit is not 0 to the `SCORE` variable. The function prints out the final value of `SCORE`. However, the code contains errors and missing functionality as follows:
1. The code does not properly convert the input values to integers which could lead to TypeError.
2. The range function should take an integer, but it is currently passed a string which will cause a TypeError.
3. The condition `if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0` does not correctly check if the last digit is 0, as intended, due to incorrect data type conversion.
