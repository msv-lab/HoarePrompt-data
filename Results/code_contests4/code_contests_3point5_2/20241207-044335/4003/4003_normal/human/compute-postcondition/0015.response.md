Postcondition: ***A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; `testSNs` is a list containing the input values. If the last digit of the element at index `x` in `testSNs` is not 0, then `SCORE` is incremented by the value at index `x`. Otherwise, no change in `SCORE`. For the loop to execute one more time, the first element of `testSNs` must be greater than `x+2`.***
