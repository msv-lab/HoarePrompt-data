Postcondition: ***A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list containing the input values. If testSNs[x] % 10 is not equal to 0, SCORE is incremented by the value at index x of testSNs. For the loop to execute one more time, the first element of testSNs must be greater than x+1. Otherwise, SCORE is incremented.***
