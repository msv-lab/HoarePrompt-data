Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop. In this case, no variables are affected, and the loop will continue executing. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list containing the input values, for the loop to execute one more time, the first element of testSNs must be greater than x+2.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list containing the input values, for the loop to execute one more time, the first element of testSNs must be greater than x+2**
