Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but it skips the rest of the code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list containing the input values, SCORE is incremented, for the loop to execute one more time the first element of testSNs must be greater than x+1.
