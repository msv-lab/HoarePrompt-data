Example Answer:
SCORE is incremented by the value at testSNs[x]. Since testSNs[x] is not divisible by 10, the value of SCORE is increased by the value at testSNs[x]. The values of A, B, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list containing the input values, SCORE is an integer with an incremented value.
Output State: **A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list containing the input values; SCORE is an integer with an incremented value**
