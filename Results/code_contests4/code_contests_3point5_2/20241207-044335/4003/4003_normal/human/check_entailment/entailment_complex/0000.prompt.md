You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two integers A and B as the input. Output the value of A + B.

However, if A + B is 10 or greater, output `error` instead.

Constraints

* A and B are integers.
* 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


A B


Output

If A + B is 10 or greater, print the string `error` (case-sensitive); otherwise, print the value of A + B.

Examples

Input

6 3


Output

9


Input

6 4


Output

error
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9.**
def func():
    testSNs = raw_input().split()
    SCORE = int(0)
    for x in range(testSNs[0]):
        if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0:
            SCORE += testSNs[x]
        else:
            continue
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: A and B are integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 9; testSNs is a list containing the input values. SCORE will be the sum of all elements in testSNs where the last digit of each element is not 0.
    print(SCORE)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings, and initializes a variable `SCORE` to 0. It then iterates through the elements of the list, summing up those elements where the last digit is not 0 to the `SCORE` variable. The function prints out the final value of `SCORE`. However, the code contains errors and missing functionality as follows:
1. The code does not properly convert the input values to integers which could lead to TypeError.
2. The range function should take an integer, but it is currently passed a string which will cause a TypeError.
3. The condition `if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0` does not correctly check if the last digit is 0, as intended, due to incorrect data type conversion.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
