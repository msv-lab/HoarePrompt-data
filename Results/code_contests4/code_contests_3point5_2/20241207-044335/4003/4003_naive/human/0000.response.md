Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
A, B = map(int, input().split())

if A + B >= 10:
    print("error")
else:
    print(A + B)
```

The issues in the original program are:
1. It uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. It should use `input()` instead.
2. It tries to iterate over the input values using a range of the first number, which is incorrect.
3. The condition `if not testSNs[x] % 10 is 0:` is not correct for checking if the sum is 10 or greater.
