Correctness: **False**

The given program does not output the midpoint of the contest correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

Input
```
10:00
14:00
```

Output
```
12:00
```

The correct midpoint for this case should be 12:00, but the program outputs 12:30. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
