You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is going to participate in the contest. It starts at h_1:m_1 and ends at h_2:m_2. It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, where x \% y is x modulo y). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.

Polycarp wants to know the time of the midpoint of the contest. For example, if the contest lasts from 10:00 to 11:00 then the answer is 10:30, if the contest lasts from 11:10 to 11:12 then the answer is 11:11.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers h_1 and m_1 in the format hh:mm.

The second line of the input contains two integers h_2 and m_2 in the same format (hh:mm).

It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59.

It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2, where x \% y is x modulo y). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.

Output

Print two integers h_3 and m_3 (0 ≤ h_3 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_3 ≤ 59) corresponding to the midpoint of the contest in the format hh:mm. Print each number as exactly two digits (prepend a number with leading zero if needed), separate them with ':'.

Examples

Program:
```
a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))
c = a[0] * 60 + a[1]
a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))
c += a[0] * 60 + a[1]
c /= 2
d = map(str, divmod(c, 60))
if len(d[0]) == 1:
    d[0] = '0' + d[0]
if len(d[1]) == 1:
    d[1] = '0' + d[1]
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
