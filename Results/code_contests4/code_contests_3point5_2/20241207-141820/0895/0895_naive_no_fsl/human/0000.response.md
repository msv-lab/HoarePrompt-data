Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two inputs representing the start and end times of the contest, calculates the total minutes of the contest, finds the midpoint, and then converts it back to the format hh:mm. The logic seems correct and aligns with the problem description provided. The program handles the edge cases of single-digit hours and minutes by padding them with a leading zero if needed. Additionally, the program ensures that the contest lasts an even number of minutes and for at least two minutes, as mentioned in the problem description. Overall, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
