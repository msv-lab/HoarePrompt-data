Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two input times in the format hh:mm, calculates the average time, and ensures that the minutes part of the average time has two digits.
- It then checks if the minutes of the average time have the same parity (both even or both odd) and adjusts the formatting if necessary.
- The code correctly handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description:
    1. The contest lasts an even number of minutes.
    2. The contest lasts at least two minutes.
    3. The entire contest is held during a single day.
    4. The input times are in the valid range (0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23 and 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59).
- The code produces the midpoint of the contest in the correct format as required by the problem description.
- There are no edge cases identified where the code does not work as expected.
