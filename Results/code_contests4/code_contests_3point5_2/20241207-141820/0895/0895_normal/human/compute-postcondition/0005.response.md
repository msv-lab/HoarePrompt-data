Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the result of dividing `c` by 60 and converting the quotient and remainder into strings. Since `c` is updated to half of its previous value, the value of `d` will be based on the updated value of `c`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, `a` remain unchanged; `c` is updated to half of its previous value, `d` is a list of strings representing the result of dividing the updated `c` by 60.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, `a` remain unchanged; `c` is updated to half of its previous value, `d` is a list of strings representing the result of dividing the updated `c` by 60**
