The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for comparing two time values given as (h_1, m_1) and (h_2, m_2) and determining if the minutes part of both times have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). The function does not return any value, but it performs this comparison and does not have any explicit return statement.
