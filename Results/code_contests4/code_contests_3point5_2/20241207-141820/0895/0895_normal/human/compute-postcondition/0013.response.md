Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two time values in the format (hours:minutes) from the user input, calculates the average time between the two given times, and ensures that the minutes part of the average time has two digits. It then checks if the minutes of the average time have the same parity (both even or both odd) and adjusts the formatting if necessary. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs these operations. **
