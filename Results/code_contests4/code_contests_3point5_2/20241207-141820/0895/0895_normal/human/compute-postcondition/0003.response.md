Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by the product of the first element of list `a` multiplied by 60 and added to the second element of list `a`. The values of `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, `c` remain unchanged; `a` is a list containing two integers representing the hours and minutes input, `c` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, `c` remain unchanged; `a` is a list containing two integers representing the hours and minutes input, `c` is updated based on the calculation**
