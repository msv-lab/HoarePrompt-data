Example Answer:
The code snippet `a = map(int, raw_input().split(':'))` takes input in the format of `hh:mm` and converts it into a list of integers. However, `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, so it should be replaced with `input()`. The input values correspond to the hours and minutes of two different times. After execution, `a` will be a list containing two integers representing the hours and minutes respectively. The variables `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, and `c` are not directly affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, `m_2`, `c` remain unchanged; `a` is a list containing two integers representing the hours and minutes input**
