Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `a[0] * 60 + a[1]`, where `a[0]` and `a[1]` are extracted from the input map object `a`. The variables `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, and m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `c` is calculated based on the input values of `a`.
Output State: **`h_1`, `m_1`, `h_2`, and `m_2` are integers such that 0 ≤ h_1, h_2 ≤ 23, 0 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ 59, and m_1 % 2 = m_2 % 2; `c` is calculated based on the input values of `a`**
