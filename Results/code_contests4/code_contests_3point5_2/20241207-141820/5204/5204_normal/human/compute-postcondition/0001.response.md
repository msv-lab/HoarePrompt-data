Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. The value of `q` is unknown, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an input integer, `p` is the input value, `q` is unknown.
Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `p` is the input value, `q` is unknown**
