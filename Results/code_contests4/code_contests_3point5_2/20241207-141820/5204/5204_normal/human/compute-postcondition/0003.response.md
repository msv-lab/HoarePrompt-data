Example Answer:
`l` is converted to a float and divided by the sum of `p` and `q`. The result is then multiplied by `p`. The final output state depends on the values of `l`, `p`, and `q` provided as input.
Output State: **`l` is a float, `p` is the input value, `q` holds the input value, a calculated value based on the input values is returned**
