Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. The previous value of `q` is unknown, so after execution, `q` will hold the input value. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is an input integer, `p` is the input value, `q` holds the input value.
Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `p` is the input value, `q` holds the input value**
