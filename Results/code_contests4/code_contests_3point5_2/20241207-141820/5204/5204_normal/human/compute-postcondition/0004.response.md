The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates with predefined integer variables `l`, `p`, and `q`. The constraints for these variables are that `l` is an integer between 1 and 1000, while `p` and `q` are integers between 1 and 500. The function does not return any value explicitly.
