Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses as described in the problem. The program calculates a different value by dividing l by the sum of p and q, and then multiplying by p. This calculation does not match the requirements of the problem description.
