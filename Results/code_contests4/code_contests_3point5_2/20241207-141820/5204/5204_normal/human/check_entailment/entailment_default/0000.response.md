Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the distance incorrectly and does not produce the expected output. The formula used `(float(l) / (p + q)) * p` is incorrect for calculating the distance from the end of the corridor to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses. The correct formula should take into account the relative speeds of the two magical impulses. The code does not handle the scenario where the speeds of the impulses are unequal, leading to an incorrect result. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the accurate distance calculation as described in the problem.
