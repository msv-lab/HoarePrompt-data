Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses as described in the problem. 

The correct formula to calculate the distance is: ```l * p / (p + q)```

The provided program incorrectly calculates: ```(float(l) / (p + q)) * p```

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
