Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the distance from Harry's position to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses as described in the problem. It calculates the time taken for the two impulses to meet and collide, and then multiplies it by Harry's speed to get the distance from his position to the collision point. The program handles all potential cases and the logic is sound.
