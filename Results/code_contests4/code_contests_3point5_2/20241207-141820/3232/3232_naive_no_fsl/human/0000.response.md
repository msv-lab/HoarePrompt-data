Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the input processing. The program is splitting the input based on whitespace, but the input format specifies that the departure time and arrival time are separated by a single space. Therefore, the program should split the input based on space instead of whitespace. This logical error will lead to incorrect input processing and, as a result, incorrect output.
