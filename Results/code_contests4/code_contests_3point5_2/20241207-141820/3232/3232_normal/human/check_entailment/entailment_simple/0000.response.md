Correctness: **True**

The program reads the number of trains in the timetable and then reads the departure and arrival times for each train at Osaki Station. It then calculates the number of trains running at each second using a list `dp`, where each element represents the number of trains running at that second. By keeping track of when trains arrive and depart, it accurately calculates the number of trains running at each second.

Finally, it prints the maximum number of trains running at any given second, which represents the minimum number of vehicles required to operate the Yamanote Line. The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for the given input.
