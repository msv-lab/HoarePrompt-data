Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of trains `n` and the departure and arrival times of each train at the Osaki Station.
- It correctly calculates the maximum number of trains present at any given time by incrementing and decrementing the count of trains based on the departure and arrival times.
- The code handles the edge case where two trains depart at the same time by incrementing the count for that specific time.
- The output matches the problem description, providing the minimum number of vehicles required to operate the Yamanote Line based on the timetable given.
