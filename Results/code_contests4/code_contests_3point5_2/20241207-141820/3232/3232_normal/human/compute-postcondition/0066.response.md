According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement or an exit condition within the loop body. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted in a way that the loop can continue to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements before it, `a, b, c, d, e, f` are the last values assigned after the final iteration of the loop, the last element in `dp` is the sum of all elements in the original `dp` list, the maximum value in `dp` is updated and any other necessary adjustments are made for the loop to continue executing**
