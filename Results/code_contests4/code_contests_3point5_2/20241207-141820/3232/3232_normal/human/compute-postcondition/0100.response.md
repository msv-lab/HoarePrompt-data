Functionality: ** The function `func` reads the number of trains `n` as a non-negative integer. Each train's departure and arrival times are provided in the format hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss on separate lines, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The departure time is always before the arrival time. The function then calculates the maximum number of trains present at any given time and prints that value. **
