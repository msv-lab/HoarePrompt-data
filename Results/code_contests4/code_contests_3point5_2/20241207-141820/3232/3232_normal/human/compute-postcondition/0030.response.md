According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than the updated `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than the updated `i`**
