Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements before it, `a, b, c, d, e, f` are the last values assigned after the final iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is less than `m`, the element at index `i + 1` in `dp` is incremented by the element at index `i + 1**.
