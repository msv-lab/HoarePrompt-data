The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function reads the number of trains `n` as a non-negative integer. Each train's departure and arrival times are provided in the format hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss on separate lines, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The departure time is always before the arrival time. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read the number of trains and their departure and arrival times in the specified format.
