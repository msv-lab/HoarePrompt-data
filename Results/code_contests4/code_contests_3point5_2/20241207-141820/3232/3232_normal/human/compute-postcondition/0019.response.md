According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` must be less than `n`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1. Additionally, `a` and `d` need to be reassigned the values after splitting, `a, b, c` and `d, e, f` need to be assigned the integer values after splitting and mapping them to integers.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of 0s with a length of `m + 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `d` are assigned the first and second input values after splitting respectively, `a, b, c` are assigned the integer values after splitting `a` by ':' and mapping them to integers, `d, e, f` are assigned the integer values after splitting `d` by ':' and mapping them to integers**.
