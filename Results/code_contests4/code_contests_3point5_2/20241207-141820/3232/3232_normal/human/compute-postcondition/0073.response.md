Example Answer:
The `map` function is used to apply the `int` function to each element after splitting the string `a` based on the delimiter `':'`. Since `a` is assigned a value based on user input, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be determined after splitting `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting `a`**
