Example Answer:
The value of `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decremented by 1. The updated value of `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` will be one less than its previous value. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1**
