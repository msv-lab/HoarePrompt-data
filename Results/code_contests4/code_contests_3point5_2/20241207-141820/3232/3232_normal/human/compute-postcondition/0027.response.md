Example Answer:
The value in dp at index i+1 is incremented by the value in dp at index i. The initial state tells us that `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dp` is a list of 0s with a length of m + 1. Since we do not have the values of `n` or `m`, we cannot determine the exact values in the list `dp` after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values based on the previous state.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values based on the previous state**
