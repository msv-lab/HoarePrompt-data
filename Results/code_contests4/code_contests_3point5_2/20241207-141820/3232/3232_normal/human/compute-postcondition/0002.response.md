Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` now holds the number of trains in the timetable. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is the number of trains in the timetable**
