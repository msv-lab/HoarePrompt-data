Example Answer:
`a` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`. The `split()` method splits the input string based on whitespace and returns a list of the split values. The values of `a` and `d` depend on the user input, so they can be any string values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned values based on user input**
