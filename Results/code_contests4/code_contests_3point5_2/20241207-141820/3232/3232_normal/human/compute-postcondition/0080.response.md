Example Answer:
`d`, `e`, `f` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the string `d` using ':' as a delimiter. The previous values of `d` are greater than 0 and the updated values are obtained from the split operation. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1**
