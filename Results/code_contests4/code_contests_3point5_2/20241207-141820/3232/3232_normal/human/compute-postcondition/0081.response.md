Example Answer:
The value of `dp[a * 3600 + b * 60 + c]` is incremented by 1. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated from splitting `a`, and the variables `d`, `e`, and `f` are updated from splitting `a`. Additionally, the value of `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1**
