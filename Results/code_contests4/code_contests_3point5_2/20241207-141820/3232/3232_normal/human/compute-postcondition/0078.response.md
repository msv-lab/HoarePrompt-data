Example Answer:
`a` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, Updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated values of `d`, `e`, and `f` obtained from splitting `a`, Updated `dp[d * 3600 + e * 60 + f]` after decrementing by 1**
