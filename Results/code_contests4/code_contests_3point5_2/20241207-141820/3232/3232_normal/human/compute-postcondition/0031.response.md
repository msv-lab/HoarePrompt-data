Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `dp[i] + dp[i]`, which means `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]` to itself. The previous values of `i` and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values, `m` must be greater than the updated `i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values, `m` must be greater than the updated `i`**
