Example Answer:
The value of `d` is split by ":" and then mapped to integers `d`, `e`, and `f`. The previous value of `d` is used in index calculation, and the `dp` list is decremented at the calculated index. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is split and mapped to integers, `d`, `e`, `f` are mapped to integers from `d.split(':') and used in index calculation to decrement `dp` list at the calculated index.
Output State: **`a` is split and mapped to integers, `d`, `e`, `f` are mapped to integers from `d.split(':') and used in index calculation to decrement `dp` list at the calculated index.**
