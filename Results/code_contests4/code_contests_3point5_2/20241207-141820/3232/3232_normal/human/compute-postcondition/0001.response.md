Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it will run indefinitely. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once. Hence, the state right before the loop should be repeated.
State: **n is a non-negative integer indicating the number of trains in the timetable. Each train's departure and arrival times are given in the format hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss on separate lines, where hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and ss is the second. The departure time is always before the arrival time. m is the total number of seconds in a day**
