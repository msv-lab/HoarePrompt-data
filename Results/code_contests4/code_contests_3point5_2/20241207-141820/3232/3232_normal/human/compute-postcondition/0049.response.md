Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements before it in the initial dp list with the updated value at index `a * 3600 + b * 60 + c`, `a, b, c` are the last values assigned after the final iteration of the loop, the maximum value in `dp` is printed, we exit the most internal loop or if statement, `_` is incremented by 1, `a, b, c, d, e, f` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string, `a, b, c` are assigned the values obtained by splitting `a` using `split(':')`, `d, e, f` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the string `d` using `split(':')` and converting them to integers.**
