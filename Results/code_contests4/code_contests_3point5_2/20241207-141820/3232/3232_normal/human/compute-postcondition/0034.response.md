Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. The program state remains the same.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements before it in the initial dp list, `a, b, c, d, e, f` are the last values assigned after the final iteration of the loop, maximum value in `dp` is printed**
