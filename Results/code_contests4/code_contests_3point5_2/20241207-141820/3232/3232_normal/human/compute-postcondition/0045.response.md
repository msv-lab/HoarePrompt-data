According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements before it in the initial dp list, `a, b, c, d, e, f` are the last values assigned after the final iteration of the loop, the maximum value in `dp` is printed, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement, `_` is incremented by 1**
