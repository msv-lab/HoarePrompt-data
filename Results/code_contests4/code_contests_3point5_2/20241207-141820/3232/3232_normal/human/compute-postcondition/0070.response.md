Example Answer:
The list `dp` is initialized with `m + 1` elements, where `m` is the value of the input taken from the user and stored in `n`. If `n` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of the input taken from the user. If `n` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the input taken from the user. If `n` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.**
