According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop will execute again, so `i` will be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values based on the previous state, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than the updated `i`**
