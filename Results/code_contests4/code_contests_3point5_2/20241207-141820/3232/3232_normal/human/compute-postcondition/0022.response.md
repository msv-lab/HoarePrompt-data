Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of 0s with a length of `m + 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `d` are assigned the input values after splitting respectively, `a, b, c` are assigned the integer values after splitting `a` by ':' and mapping them to integers, `d, e, f` are assigned the integer values after splitting `d` by ':' and mapping them to integers, `d, e, f` are updated by mapping `int` to the split values of `d`**
