Example Answer:
The variables `d`, `e`, and `f` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting `d` using the ':' delimiter. The variable `d` is obtained from splitting `a`, but the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting `a`; `d`, `e`, and `f` are integers obtained from splitting `a`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting `a`; `d`, `e`, and `f` are integers obtained from splitting `a`**
