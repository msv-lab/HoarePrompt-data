Example Answer:
`a` and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The value at index `d * 3600 + e * 60 + f` in `dp` list is decremented by 1, but the initial values of `e` and `f` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `d` are assigned values from input; the value at index `d * 3600 + e * 60 + f` in `dp` list is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`a` and `d` are assigned values from input; the value at index `d * 3600 + e * 60 + f` in `dp` list is decremented by 1**
