Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]`. Since `dp` is a list of updated values based on the previous state, the value of `dp[i + 1]` is updated accordingly. The loop will execute one more time if `m` is greater than the updated `i`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp` is a list of updated values based on the previous state, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than the updated `i`**
