Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a function `func_1` which generates all possible numbers with `p` digits that satisfy the given condition.
2. The program then defines a function `func_2` which reads the input, checks for a specific condition (x == 5 and p % 42 == 0), and calls `func_1` accordingly. If the condition is not met, it iterates from 1 to 1000 to find the minimum possible number and prints it.
3. The program handles the case of "Impossible" correctly when a very beautiful number does not exist.
4. The program uses the correct logic to generate the desired number by iterating through all possible numbers with `p` digits and checking the condition.
5. The program is well-structured and follows the problem description accurately.
