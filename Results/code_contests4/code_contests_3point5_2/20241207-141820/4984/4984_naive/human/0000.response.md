Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to find the "very beautiful number" based on the input parameters `p` and `x`. The program iterates through possible numbers and calculates if the conditions are met for a number to be considered "very beautiful". It then prints the minimal possible "very beautiful number" without leading zeroes.

The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the output number is strictly positive, doesn't contain leading zeroes, has the specified length of decimal digits, and grows exactly x times when the last digit is moved to the beginning. The program also handles cases where it is impossible to find such a number.

Since the program covers all possible scenarios and produces the correct output based on the given conditions, it can be considered correct.
