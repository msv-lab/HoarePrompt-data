Output State: **`p` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 9, `c` contains at least one element, `s` is 0, `b` is the final updated value of `b`, `a` is a list containing the final values of `b` after all iterations of the loop have executed and has been reversed. The loop does not execute more than once as the loop has a return statement which exits the loop.**
