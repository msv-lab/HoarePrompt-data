Example Answer:
The function `func_1` takes two parameters `i` and `x`, and the result is assigned to `s`. The overall state of the program is maintained unless `func_1` modifies any global variables. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **The program may return `s` repeated `p` divided by `l` times if `p % l == 0`, otherwise the overall state of the program is maintained**
