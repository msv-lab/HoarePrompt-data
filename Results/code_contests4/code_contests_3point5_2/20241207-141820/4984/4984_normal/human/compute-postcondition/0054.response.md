Postcondition: ***After the if condition, `a` is a list containing all the appended values of `b` in reverse order, `s` is the final result of the division of `b * x + s` by 10 after all iterations, `b` is the final remainder of the division of `b * x + s` by 10 after all iterations, `i` is assigned the final value of `b`, `c` contains the final values of `b` as strings, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be equal to 2, `j` is equal to `p-1`, `b` is equal to `i`, `s` is equal to 0, and `c` has the appended values of `b` converted to strings.***
