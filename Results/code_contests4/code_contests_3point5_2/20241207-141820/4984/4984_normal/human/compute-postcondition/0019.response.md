According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `p` and `l`. If `p % l == 0`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the program may return `s` repeated `p` divided by `l` times. So for the loop to execute one more time, `p % l` must be equal to 0.
State: **The program may return `s` repeated `p` divided by `l` times if `p % l == 0`, for the loop to execute again `p % l` must be equal to 0**
