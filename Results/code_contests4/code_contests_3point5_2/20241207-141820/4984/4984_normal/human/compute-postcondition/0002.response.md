Example Answer:
`func_1(42, 5)` is called, which returns 42. Since `p` is divisible by 42, and `x` equals 5, the result of the multiplication is `42 * (p / 42) = p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9.
Output State: **`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9**
