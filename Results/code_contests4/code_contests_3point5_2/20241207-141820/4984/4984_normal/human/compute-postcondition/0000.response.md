Example Answer:
`p` and `x` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The values of `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9.
Output State: **`p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9**
