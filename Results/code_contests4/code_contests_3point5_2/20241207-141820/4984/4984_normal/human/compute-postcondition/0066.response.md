Postcondition: ***`p` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 9, `c` contains at least two more elements, `s` is 0, `b` is the final updated value of `b`, `a` is a list containing the final values of `b` after all iterations of the loop have executed and has been reversed, and the next element in `c` is assigned to `r`. If `r[0]` is not equal to '0', the program returns the next element in list `c`, which is assigned to `r`.***
