Postcondition: ***p and x are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9. Either x is not equal to 5 or p is not divisible by 42, s is the result of calling func_1 with arguments i and x. If the result of s is False, then no further action is taken, l is the length of s. If p % l == 0, the output is printed as s repeated p divided by l times. If p % l != 0, the overall state of the program is maintained.***
