Output State: **`p` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 9, `c` contains the final values of `b` as strings, `s` is 0, `b` contains the final updated value of `b`, `a` contains the final values of `b` after all iterations of the loop have executed and has been reversed, `i` is assigned the value of `b`, `a` is a list containing the appended values of `b` after all iterations of the loop have executed, `b` is equal to `i`, `s` is equal to 0, and `c` contains the final values of `b` as strings, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be equal to 2, `b` is equal to `i`**
