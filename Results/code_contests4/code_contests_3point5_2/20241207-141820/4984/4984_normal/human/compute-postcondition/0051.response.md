Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` is a list containing all the appended values of `b`, `s` is the final result of the division of `b * x + s` by 10 after all iterations, `b` is the final remainder of the division of `b * x + s` by 10 after all iterations, `i` is assigned the final value of `b`, `c` contains the final values of `b` as strings, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be equal to 2, and `j` is equal to `p-1`. Additionally, after the if condition `b` is equal to `i` and `s` is equal to 0.***
