The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is as follows:

Case_1: The program does not return any specific value or variable.

Case_2: The program will return `s` repeated `p` divided by `l` times if `p % l == 0`. Otherwise, it will print 'Impossible'. This means that the function will either return a string `s` repeated `p` times divided by `l` if `p % l == 0`, or it will print 'Impossible' if the division is not possible.
