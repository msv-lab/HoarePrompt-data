Output State: **`p` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 9, `c` contains the final values of `b` as strings, `s` is the result of the division of `b * x + s` by 10, `b` is the remainder of the division of `b * x + s` by 10, `a` is a list containing the appended values of `b` after all iterations of the loop have executed with 2 appended, `i` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is equal to `i`, `s` is equal to the previous result of the division, `c` contains the final values of `b` as strings, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be equal to 2, `b` is equal to `i`, and `j` is 0**
