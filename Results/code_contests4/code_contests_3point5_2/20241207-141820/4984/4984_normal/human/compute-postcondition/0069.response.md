The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `p` and `x`, where `p` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= p <= 10^6 and 1 <= x <= 9. 

After executing the function body, there are multiple cases for the return value:

Case 1: The program returns the list 'r' after all iterations of the loop have executed and has been reversed. The first element of 'r' is not '0'.

Case 2: The program returns the next element in list `c`, which is assigned to `r`.

Case 3: The program returns the next element in list `c`, which is assigned to `r`.

Case 4: The program returns an empty string as the loop does not execute more than once and has a return statement that exits the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `p` and `x`, and depending on the conditions within the loop, it returns different values described in the cases above.
