Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads two positive integers `p` and `x`. If `x` is 5 and `p` is divisible by 42, it calls `func_1(42, 5)` and prints the result multiplied by `(p / 42)`. If these conditions are not met, it iterates through integers from 1 to 999 and calls `func_1` with `i` and `x`. If the result is not empty, it calculates the length of the result `s`, and if `p % l == 0`, it prints `s` repeated `p` divided by `l` times; otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'. Therefore, the function outputs the result of a multiplication or 'Impossible' based on specific conditions.**
