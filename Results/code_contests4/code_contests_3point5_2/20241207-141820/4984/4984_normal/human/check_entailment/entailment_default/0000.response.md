Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the "very beautiful number" as described in the problem statement. It iterates through different numbers, performs calculations based on the conditions provided, and returns the minimal possible number that satisfies all the conditions. The code follows the problem description for every potential case.
- The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, checks specific conditions, and calls `func_1` accordingly to find the "very beautiful number" or print "Impossible" if such a number does not exist. The code handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.

Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints provided.
