Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` both take the input parameters `p` and `x` as described in the problem description.
2. Function `func_1` iterates through a loop to find a "very beautiful number" based on the conditions specified in the problem description.
3. Function `func_2` reads the input integers `p` and `x`, and then either performs a multiplication operation or prints "Impossible" based on certain conditions, which align with the problem description.
4. The code logic in both functions adheres to the problem description by finding the minimal possible "very beautiful number" that satisfies the given conditions.
5. The annotations provide an overview of the program state before and after function calls, which helps in understanding the flow of the code and the expected outcomes.
6. Overall, the code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output for each case.
