Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It finds the "very beautiful number" as described in the problem statement. The program iterates through all possible numbers and checks if the conditions are satisfied. It then returns the minimal possible number that meets the conditions. The program also handles the case where such a number does not exist and prints "Impossible". The logic in both functions is sound and follows the requirements of the problem description.
