Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` and returns 1 by dividing the factorial of `n` by `n!`. However, this does not correctly calculate the number of ways to place the benches in the park as described in the problem statement. The calculation of `x` in the main part of the code also does not align with the problem description. 

Additionally, the output hints do not provide any support for the code being correct as they refer to the wrong function definition and do not align with the actual code implementation. Hence, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the code is False.
