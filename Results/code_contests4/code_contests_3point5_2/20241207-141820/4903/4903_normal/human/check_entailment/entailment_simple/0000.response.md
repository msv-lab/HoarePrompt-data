Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to place the benches as described in the problem description. The program calculates the factorial of n for both r and s, but then divides r by s, resulting in 1. This does not give the correct number of ways to place the benches.

The correct approach should involve calculating the factorial of n and then using the formula for permutations to calculate the number of ways to place the benches. The correct formula should be n! * n! * n! * n! * n! to account for each bench being placed on a different path.

Therefore, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
