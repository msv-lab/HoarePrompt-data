The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100. After executing the function body, the program returns 1, as `r` is the factorial of `n` and `s` is n!, so `r/s` is equal to n!/n! which simplifies to 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified constraints and another parameter `a`, and return 1 based on the calculations described. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and a. n is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100. The program returns 1, as r is the factorial of n and s is n!, so r/s is equal to n!/n! which simplifies to 1.**
