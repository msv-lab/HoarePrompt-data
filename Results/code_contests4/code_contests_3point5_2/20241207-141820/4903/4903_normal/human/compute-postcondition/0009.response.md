According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `i`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **Output State: n is an integer such that 5 <= n <= 100, r is the product of r and p, s is the product of s and g, p is assigned the value of n-1, g is 2, for the loop to execute a second time a is greater than 1, i is 1**
