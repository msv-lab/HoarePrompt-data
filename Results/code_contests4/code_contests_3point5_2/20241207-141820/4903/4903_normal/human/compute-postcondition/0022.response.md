Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and a, where n is an integer satisfying 5 <= n <= 100. The function calculates the factorial of n and returns 1 by dividing the factorial of n by n!. **

The code correctly computes the factorial of n and returns 1 by dividing the factorial of n by n!. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program after the execution of the for loop. The code covers the case where n is within the specified range. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases to consider in this scenario.
