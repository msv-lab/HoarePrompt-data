Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem description. It reads the input, creates dictionaries from the input lists, calculates the maximum number of moves needed to convert the first permutation to the second, and prints the result. The algorithm considers all possible cases and correctly determines the minimum number of moves needed for each element in the permutation. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all test cases.
