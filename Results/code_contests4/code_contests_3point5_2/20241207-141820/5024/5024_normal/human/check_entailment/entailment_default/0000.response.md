Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input, creates dictionaries for the starting and ending permutations, calculates the maximum number of moves needed to convert the first permutation to the second, and prints the result. The code accurately follows the problem description for all cases mentioned. It correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second by considering the positions of the elements in the two permutations and determining the maximum number of moves needed for any corresponding element. The code handles the edge cases where the number of moves may be negative and correctly outputs the minimum number of moves required. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the examples provided.
