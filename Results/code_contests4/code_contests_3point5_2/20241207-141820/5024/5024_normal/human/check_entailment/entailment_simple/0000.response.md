Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second permutation by iterating through each element in the first permutation, finding its corresponding index in the second permutation, and calculating the number of moves needed to move that element to the correct position. It then keeps track of the maximum number of moves needed among all elements and prints the result.

The program handles all possible cases and correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
