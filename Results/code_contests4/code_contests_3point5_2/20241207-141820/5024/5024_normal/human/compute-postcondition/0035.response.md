Example Answer:
`n_moves` is assigned the value `i2 - i1`, where `i1` and `i2` are integers. The value of `n_moves` depends on the values of `i1` and `i2`, which are not provided. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is updated to the maximum value between `res` and `n_moves` if `n_moves` is less than 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is updated to the maximum value between `res` and `n_moves` if `n_moves` is less than 0**
