Example Answer:
`n_moves` is assigned the value of `n - i1`. The value of `n` is an integer, and the value of `i1` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is updated to the maximum value between `res` and `n_moves`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is updated to the maximum value between `res` and `n_moves`**
