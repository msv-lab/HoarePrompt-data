Example Answer: 
`n_moves` is assigned the value of `i2 - i1`, where `i2` and `i1` are assumed to be integers. The value of `n_moves` is dependent on the values of `i2` and `i1`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is 0**
