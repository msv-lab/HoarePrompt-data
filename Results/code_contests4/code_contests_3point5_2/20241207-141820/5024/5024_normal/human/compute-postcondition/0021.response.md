Example Answer:
`i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`. The value of `v1` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `i2` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is 0**
