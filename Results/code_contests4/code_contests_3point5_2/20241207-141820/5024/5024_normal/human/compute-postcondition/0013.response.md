Example Answer:
`end_m` is a dictionary where the key `val` is assigned the value `index`. The value of `val` is taken from the `end` list and `index` is 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index`, `end_m` is a dictionary with the first element of `end` list as key and 0 as value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index`, `end_m` is a dictionary with the first element of `end` list as key and 0 as value**
