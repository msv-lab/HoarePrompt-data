Example Answer: 
`n_moves` is calculated as `n - i1`, and if `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between `res` and `n_moves`. The previous values of `res`, `n_moves`, and `n` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is updated based on the condition mentioned.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is updated based on the condition mentioned**
