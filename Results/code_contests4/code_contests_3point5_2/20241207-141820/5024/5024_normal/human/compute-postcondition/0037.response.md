Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value. If `n_moves` is less than 0, `res` is updated to the maximum value between `res` and `n_moves`, where `n_moves` is calculated as `n - i1`.***
