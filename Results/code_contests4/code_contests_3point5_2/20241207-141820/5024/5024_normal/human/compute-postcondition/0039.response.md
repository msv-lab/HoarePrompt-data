Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with keys and corresponding indices, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is the maximum value of all calculated `n_moves` after iterating through all key-value pairs in `start_m`**
