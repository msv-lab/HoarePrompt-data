Example Answer:
The value of `val` from the end list is used as the key to access the `index` value, which is then assigned to `end_m`. The initial state values are `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index`, `end_m` is a dictionary with the second element of `end` list as key and 0 as value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index`, `end_m` is a dictionary with the second element of `end` list as key and the corresponding `index` value as its new value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index`, `end_m` is a dictionary with the second element of `end` list as key and the corresponding `index` value as its new value**
