Example Answer:
`start_m` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The values of `n`, `start`, and `end` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `start` is a list of integers obtained from input, `end` is a list of integers obtained from input, `start_m` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `start` is a list of integers obtained from input, `end` is a list of integers obtained from input, `start_m` is an empty dictionary**
