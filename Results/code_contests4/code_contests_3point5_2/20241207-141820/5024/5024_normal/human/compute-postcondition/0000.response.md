Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line from the standard input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 2*10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5**
