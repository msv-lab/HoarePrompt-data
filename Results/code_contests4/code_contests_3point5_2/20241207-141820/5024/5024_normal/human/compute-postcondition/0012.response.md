According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `end` list has at least 1 element. In this case, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the `end` list. 

Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `start` is a list of integers obtained from input, `end` is a list of integers obtained from input with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index` where `val` is each element in the `start` list and `index` is the index of that element in the `start` list, `end_m` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `index` is 0 and `val` is the first element in the `end` list.**
