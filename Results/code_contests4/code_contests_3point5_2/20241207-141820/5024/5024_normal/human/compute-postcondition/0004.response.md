According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the start list. If the start list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, start_m is an empty dictionary, and the loop index starts from 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the start list must have at least 1 element, and the index is 0 and val is the first element in the start list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `start` is a list of integers obtained from input with at least 1 element, `end` is a list of integers obtained from input, `start_m` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time index is 0 and val is the first element in the `start` list**
