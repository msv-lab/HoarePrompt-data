The value of `i2` is assigned the value of `end_m[v1]`, where `v1` is a key in the `end_m` dictionary. The value of `v1` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `i2` cannot be determined. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers, `start_m` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `end_m` is a dictionary with each element in the `end` list as key and the corresponding index as its value, `res` is updated to the maximum value between `res` and `n_moves`**
