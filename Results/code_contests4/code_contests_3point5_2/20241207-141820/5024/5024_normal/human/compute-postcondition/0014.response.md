According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `end` list. If the list has more elements to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index`, `end_m` is a dictionary with the first element of `end` list as key and 0 as value. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains the same.
- `start` remains the same.
- `end` should have more elements to iterate over.
- `start_m` remains the same.
- `end_m` will have the next element of the `end` list as key and 0 as value.

State: **`n` is an integer, `start` is a list of integers, `end` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `start_m` is a dictionary with key `val` and value `index`, `end_m` is a dictionary with the second element of `end` list as key and 0 as value**
