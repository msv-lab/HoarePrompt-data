Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem description. It reads the input, creates dictionaries to store the index of each value in both permutations, calculates the number of moves needed to convert the first permutation to the second, and finally prints the minimum number of moves required. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including moving the last number to the beginning or between any two consecutive numbers. The logic of the program is correct and it produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
