You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.

In a new ZeptoLab game called "King of Thieves" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way.

<image>

An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.

A dungeon consists of n segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. 

One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number i1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms i1 < i2 < ... < ik, if i2 - i1 = i3 - i2 = ... = ik - ik - 1. Of course, all segments i1, i2, ... ik should be exactly the platforms, not pits. 

Let's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence i1, i2, ..., i5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of segments on the level.

Next line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of n characters '*' and '.'.

Output

If the level is good, print the word "yes" (without the quotes), otherwise print the word "no" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

16
.**.*..*.***.**.


Output

yes

Input

11
.*.*...*.*.


Output

no

Note

In the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.
Program:
```
n = int(raw_input())
s = raw_input().strip()

def func_1(s):
    for j in xrange(1, len(s)):
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            if i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*':
                return True
    return False
if func_1(s):
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
