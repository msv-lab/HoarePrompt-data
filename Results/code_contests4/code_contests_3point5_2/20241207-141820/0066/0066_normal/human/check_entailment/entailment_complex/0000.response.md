Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The program checks for a sequence of five consecutive '*' characters, but the problem description specifically requires checking for a sequence of four jumps of the same length. This means that the intervals between consecutive platforms should be the same. The program does not check for this condition and only checks for five consecutive '*' characters. 

Therefore, the program does not fully follow the problem description and is incorrect.
