Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a string `s` representing the scheme of the level. The function iterates through the string to find a sequence of five consecutive '*' characters. If such a sequence exists, it returns True indicating that the level is good; otherwise, it returns False. This aligns with the problem description that states the level is good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length. The function is correctly implemented to check for the existence of a sequence of five consecutive platforms, which meets the requirements of the problem. 

The output hints also confirm that the function `func_1` is supposed to find a sequence of five consecutive '*' characters in the string `s` and return True if found. This further supports the correctness of the code. 

Therefore, based on both the code logic and the output hints, the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
