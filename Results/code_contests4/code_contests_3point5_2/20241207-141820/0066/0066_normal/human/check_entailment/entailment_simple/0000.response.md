Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that iterates through the input string `s` to check if there exists a sequence of five consecutive '*' characters. If such a sequence is found, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. This aligns with the problem description which requires checking if there is a sequence of four jumps of the same length in the level.

The program correctly identifies when a level is good based on the defined criteria and returns the expected output "yes" or "no" accordingly. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
