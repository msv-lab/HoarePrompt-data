    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will return True if there exists a sequence of five consecutive '*' characters in the string s. Otherwise, the loop will not return anything.
    return False
    #The program returns False as there is no sequence of five consecutive '*' characters in the string s
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters. It iterates through the string to find a sequence of five consecutive '*' characters. If such a sequence exists, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The functionality is to check for the existence of five consecutive '*' characters in the string `s` and return True if found.
