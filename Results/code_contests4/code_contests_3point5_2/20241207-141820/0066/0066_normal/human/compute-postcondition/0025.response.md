According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `j` should be incremented and should still be less than the length of `s`.
State: **for the loop to execute, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than the length of `s` and has been incremented**
