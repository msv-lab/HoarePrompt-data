According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false. This means that the loop can execute again as the condition is not met. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **i is less than the length of s and has been incremented, j is less than the length of s**
