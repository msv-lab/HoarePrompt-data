Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, s is a string of length n containing only '*' and '.' characters, j is 1, for the loop to execute the first time the length of s is greater than 0, i is 0. Additionally, i + 4 * j is less than the length of s and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*'***
