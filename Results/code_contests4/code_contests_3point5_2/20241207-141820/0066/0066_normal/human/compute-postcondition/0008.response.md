According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters, `j` is 2, `i` and `s` values are already adjusted. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters, `j` is 2, `i` is adjusted +1**
