Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters, `j` is 2, `i` is adjusted +1. If i + 4 * j is less than the length of `s` and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*', then the function returns True. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program state.***
