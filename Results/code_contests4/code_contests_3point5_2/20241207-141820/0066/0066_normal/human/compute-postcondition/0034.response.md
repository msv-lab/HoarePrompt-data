Postcondition: ***i is less than the length of s and has been incremented. j is less than the length of s and satisfies the condition i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*'. If the condition i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*', then the program returns True.***
