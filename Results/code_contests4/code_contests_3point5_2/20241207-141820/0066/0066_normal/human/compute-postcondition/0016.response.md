Postcondition: ***For the loop to execute one more time, length of `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than the length of `s`. Also, either (i + 4 * j is greater than or equal to len(s)) or (s[i] is not equal to s[i + j] or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 2 * j] or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 3 * j] or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 4 * j] or s[i + j] is not equal to s[i + 2 * j] or s[i + j] is not equal to s[i + 3 * j] or s[i + j] is not equal to s[i + 4 * j] or s[i + 2 * j] is not equal to s[i + 3 * j] or s[i + 2 * j] is not equal to s[i + 4 * j] or s[i + 3 * j] is not equal to s[i + 4 * j] or s[i + 4 * j] is not equal to '*')***
