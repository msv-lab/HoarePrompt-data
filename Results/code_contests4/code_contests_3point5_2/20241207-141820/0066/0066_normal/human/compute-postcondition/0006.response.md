Output State: **The program returns True if the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is true, where 'n' is greater than 1, 's' is a string of length 'n' containing only '*' and '.' characters, 'j' is 2, and 'i' and 's' values are adjusted**
