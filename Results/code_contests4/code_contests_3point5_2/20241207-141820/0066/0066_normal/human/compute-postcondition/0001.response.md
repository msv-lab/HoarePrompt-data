According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of string `s` is greater than 0. The loop will iterate over the length of string `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the length of string `s` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time the length of `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
