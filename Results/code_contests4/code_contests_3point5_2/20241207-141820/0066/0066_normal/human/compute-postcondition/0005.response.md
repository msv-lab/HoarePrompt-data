According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and the string `s`. The condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false at the end of the previous iteration. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the condition is false, the values of `i`, `j`, and `s` need to be updated.
- Since the condition involves j, let's increment j by 1: `j` is now 2.
- For the loop to execute again, the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') needs to become true. 
- Adjust the values of `i` and `s` accordingly to satisfy the condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters, `j` is 2, the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') needs to be true for the loop to execute again, `i` and `s` values are adjusted**.
