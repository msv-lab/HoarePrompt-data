According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of the string `s` is greater than 1. In this case, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 1 since n is the length of the string `s`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
