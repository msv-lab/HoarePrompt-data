Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time the length of `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is false***
