The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters. The function returns True under various conditions as follows:

- Case 1: The program returns True
- Case 2: The program returns True if the condition (i + 4 * j < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*') is true, where 'n' is greater than 1, 's' is a string of length 'n' containing only '*' and '.' characters, 'j' is 2, and 'i' and 's' values are adjusted
- Case 3: The program returns True
- Case 4: The program returns True
- Case 5: The program returns True
- Case 6: The program returns True
- Case 7: The program returns True
- Case 8: The program returns True
- Case 9: The program returns True
- Case 10: The program returns False as there is no sequence of five consecutive '*' characters in the string `s`

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of length `n` containing only '*' and '.' characters and return True under specific conditions as mentioned in the cases.
