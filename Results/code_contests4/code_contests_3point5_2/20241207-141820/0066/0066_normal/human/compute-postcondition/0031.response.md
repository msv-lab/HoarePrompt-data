Postcondition: ***i is less than the length of s and has been incremented. j is less than the length of s. If i + 4 * j is less than the length of s and s[i] == s[i + j] == s[i + 2 * j] == s[i + 3 * j] == s[i + 4 * j] == '*', then the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
