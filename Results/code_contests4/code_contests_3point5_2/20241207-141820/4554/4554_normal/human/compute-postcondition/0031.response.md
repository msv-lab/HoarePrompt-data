Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `a` contains `n` elements with values input by the user. `i` is `n-2`. `b` is a list with an additional element `a[i] / 2` added to it. `count` reflects the number of elements in `b` and is increased by 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` is an even number and is divisible by 2. The count of elements in `b` is even. The element `a[i]` is appended to list `b`. The count of elements in `b` is even. `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] / 2 + 1` if `count % 2 == 0`.***
