According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains two elements with the value `x`, `i` is 1, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains two elements with the value `x`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())**
