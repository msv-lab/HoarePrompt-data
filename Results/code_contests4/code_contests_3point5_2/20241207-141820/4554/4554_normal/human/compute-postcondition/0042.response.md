Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements with values input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list with additional element `a[i] / 2` added to it, `count` reflects the number of elements in `b` and is increased by 2, the element at index `i` in list `a` is an even number and is divisible by 2, the count of elements in `b` is even, the element `a[i]` is appended to list `b`, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] / 2 + 1`, `count` is increased by 2, and `b` now contains the updated elements when `a[i] % 2 == 0`.***
