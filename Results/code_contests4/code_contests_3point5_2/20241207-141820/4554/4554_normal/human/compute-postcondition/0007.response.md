Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `a`. Since `a` contains the value `x`, after execution, `a` will have two elements, both with the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains two elements with the value `x`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains two elements with the value `x`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**
