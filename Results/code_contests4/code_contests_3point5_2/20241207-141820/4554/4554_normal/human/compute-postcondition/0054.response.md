Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a number `n`, then inputs `n` integers into a list `a`. It then performs different operations on the elements of `a` based on their divisibility by 2 and the count of odd elements. The modified elements are stored in a list `b`, and finally, the function prints the list `b`.**
