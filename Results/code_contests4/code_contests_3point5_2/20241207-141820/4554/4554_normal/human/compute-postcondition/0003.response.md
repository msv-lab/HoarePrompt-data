Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n`, `a`, and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `x` is the input integer value.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `x` is the input integer value**
