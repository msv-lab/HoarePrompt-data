Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements with values input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list with additional element `a[i] / 2`, `count` reflects the number of elements in `b` and is increased by 3, the element at index `i` in list `a` is an even number and divisible by 2, the count of elements in `b` is even, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] / 2 + 1`, `count` is increased by 2, `b` now contains the updated elements when `a[i] % 2 == 0`, and `b` also contains the element `a[i]` if `a[i] % 2 != 0`.***
