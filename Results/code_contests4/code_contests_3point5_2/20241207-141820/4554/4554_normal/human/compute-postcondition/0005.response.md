According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the value `x`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will increase by 1 so `i` will be 1 and `n` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the value `x`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
