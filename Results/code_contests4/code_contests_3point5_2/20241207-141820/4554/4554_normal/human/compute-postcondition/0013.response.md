Example Answer:
The variable `count` is assigned the value 0. The values of other variables `n`, `a`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements with the values input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is an empty list, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements with the values input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is an empty list, `count` is 0**
