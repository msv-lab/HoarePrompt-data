Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements with values input by the user, `i` is `n-2`, `b` is a list with an additional element `a[i] / 2` added to it, `count` reflects the number of elements in `b` and is increased by 1, the element at index `i` in list `a` is an even number and is divisible by 2, the count of elements in `b` is even, the element `a[i]` is appended to list `b`, the count of elements in `b` is even, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] / 2 + 1` if `count % 2 == 0, `count` is increased by 1, `b` now contains the updated elements.**
