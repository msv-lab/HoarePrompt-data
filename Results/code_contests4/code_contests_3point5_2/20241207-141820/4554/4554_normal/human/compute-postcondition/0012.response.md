Example Answer:
An empty list `b` is created. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements with the values input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements with the values input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is an empty list**
