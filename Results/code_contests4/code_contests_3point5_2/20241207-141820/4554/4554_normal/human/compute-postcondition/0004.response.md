Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `a`, so the value of `a` changes to include `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the value `x`, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the value `x`, `i` is 0**
