Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input, storing the rating changes of each participant in a list.
2. It then iterates through the list and handles even and odd rating changes separately.
3. For even rating changes, it divides by 2 and appends the result to the modified rating changes list.
4. For odd rating changes, it keeps track of a count to ensure the sum remains balanced. It alternates between rounding down and rounding up the division by 2.
5. Finally, it prints the modified rating changes list, which satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
6. The program ensures that the sum of all modified rating changes is equal to 0 and that each modified rating change is as close to half of the original as possible.
