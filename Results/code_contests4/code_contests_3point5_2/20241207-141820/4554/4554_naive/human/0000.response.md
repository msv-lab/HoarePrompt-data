Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in a list 'a'. It then iterates over the list 'a' to calculate the modified rating change 'b' for each participant according to the given conditions. The program handles both even and odd values of 'a[i]' appropriately to ensure that the modified rating changes are as close to half of 'a[i]' as possible. It also ensures that the sum of all modified rating changes is equal to 0. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description provided.
