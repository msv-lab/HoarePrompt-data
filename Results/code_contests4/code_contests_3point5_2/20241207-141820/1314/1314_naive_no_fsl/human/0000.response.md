Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input graph and checks if there exists a spanning tree where the degree of the first vertex is equal to D. It then constructs the spanning tree based on the given conditions and outputs the result. The algorithm used in the program covers all possible scenarios and provides a correct output according to the problem description.
