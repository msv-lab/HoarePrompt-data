Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, constructs the graph, and then finds a spanning tree where the degree of the first vertex is equal to D. The implementation follows the problem description by checking all possible cases and conditions to ensure a valid spanning tree is generated. The code covers all possible scenarios and correctly handles them, ensuring the correctness of the program.
