Correctness: True

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, processes the graph to find a spanning tree with the required degree for the first vertex, and outputs the result in the specified format. The program handles cases where there exists a spanning tree satisfying the condition and cases where there is no such spanning tree. The implementation follows the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output.
