Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values and processes them to determine relationships between the vertices.
- It checks conditions based on these relationships and prints the results accordingly.
- The code constructs a spanning tree starting from vertex 1 where the degree of vertex 1 is equal to D.
- The code handles the case where there is no spanning tree satisfying the condition by printing "NO".
- If there is a valid spanning tree, the code prints "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree.
- The code ensures that the edges of the printed spanning tree form a subset of the input edges.
- The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
