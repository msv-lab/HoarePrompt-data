You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

Your task is to find any spanning tree of this graph such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label 1 on it) is equal to D (or say that there are no such spanning trees). Recall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and D (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2)), 1 ≤ D < n) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and required degree of the first vertex, respectively.

The following m lines denote edges: edge i is represented by a pair of integers v_i, u_i (1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair (v_i, u_i) there are no other pairs (v_i, u_i) or (u_i, v_i) in the list of edges, and for each pair (v_i, u_i) the condition v_i ≠ u_i is satisfied.

Output

If there is no spanning tree satisfying the condition from the problem statement, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line and then print n-1 lines describing the edges of a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex (vertex with label 1 on it) is equal to D. Make sure that the edges of the printed spanning tree form some subset of the input edges (order doesn't matter and edge (v, u) is considered the same as the edge (u, v)).

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
