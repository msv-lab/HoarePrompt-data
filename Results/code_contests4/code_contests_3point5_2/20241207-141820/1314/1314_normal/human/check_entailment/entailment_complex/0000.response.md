Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values, creates a graph based on the input edges, and then finds a spanning tree such that the degree of the first vertex is equal to D. It handles cases where such a spanning tree is not possible by printing "NO" and exits. It also ensures that the degree of the first vertex is not greater than D. If a valid spanning tree is found, it prints "YES" followed by the edges of the spanning tree.

The program follows the problem description accurately by checking all the necessary conditions and outputting the correct results accordingly.
