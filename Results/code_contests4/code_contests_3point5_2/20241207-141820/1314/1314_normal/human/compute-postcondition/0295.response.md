Example Answer:
The element `nxt` is removed from the list `dmain[el]`. The variables `sv`, `el`, `vis`, and `res` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` contains elements with `el` added, `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`, `vis` contains elements with `el` added, `res` contains the appended string formed by `nxt` and `el` if `el` is not in `vis`.
Output State: **`sv` contains elements with `el` added, `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`, `vis` contains elements with `el` added, `res` contains the appended string formed by `nxt` and `el` if `el` is not in `vis`**
