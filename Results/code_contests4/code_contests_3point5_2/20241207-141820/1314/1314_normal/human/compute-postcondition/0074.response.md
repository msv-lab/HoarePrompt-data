According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in `ds` corresponding to the value `nxt`. If there exists at least 1 key in `ds` that has `nxt` as its corresponding value, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tov` is now a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` where `arr[el]` was equal to 0 before the loop. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `el` to one of the keys in `ds` that corresponds to `nxt`.
State: **`tov` is now a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` where `arr[el]` was equal to 0 before the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `el` is set to one of the keys in `ds` corresponding to `nxt`**
