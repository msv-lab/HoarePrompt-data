Example Answer:
`nxt` is assigned the last element popped from the list `tov`. The `tov` list must contain elements for the loop to execute again. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables maintain their original values, `arr` updated based on conditions in the loop, and `tov` must contain elements.
Output State: **All variables maintain their original values, `arr` updated based on conditions in the loop, `tov` must contain elements**
