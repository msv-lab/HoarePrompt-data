Postcondition: ***`tov` is a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` where `arr[el]` was equal to 0 before the loop. If `arr[el]` was equal to 0, then `tov` now contains the element `el` that was added, `nxt` remains the same, `ds` remains the same, and `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`.***
