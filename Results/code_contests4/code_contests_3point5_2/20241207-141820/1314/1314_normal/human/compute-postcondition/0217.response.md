Example Answer:
The element 1 is removed from the set `dmain[el]`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `next_el`, where `next_el` is the next element in `ite` after `el`.
Output State: **`sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `next_el`, where `next_el` is the next element in `ite` after `el`**
