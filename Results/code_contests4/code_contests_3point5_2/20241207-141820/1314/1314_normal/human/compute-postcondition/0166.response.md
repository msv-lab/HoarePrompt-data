According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `tov` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` contains at least 2 values. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `tov` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them. `i` and `cur` are incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with all elements from `ds[nxt]` added to it. `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` is not empty. For the loop to execute again, the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2**.
