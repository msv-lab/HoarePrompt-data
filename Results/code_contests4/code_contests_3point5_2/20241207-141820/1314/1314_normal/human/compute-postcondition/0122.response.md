According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `ds[nxt]`, `el`, and `tov`. If `el` is less than the length of `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their original values, `arr[el]` was not equal to 0, `tov` still contains elements, `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the second element in the list, and `el` is added to the set `tov`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `el` needs to be less than the length of `ds[nxt]` and `el+1` should be added to the set `tov`.
State: **All variables maintain their original values, `arr[el]` was not equal to 0, `tov` still contains elements, for the loop to execute the third time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the third element in the list, and `el+1` is added to the set `tov`**
