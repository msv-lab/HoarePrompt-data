Example Answer:
The `res` list appends a string formed by concatenating the string representation of `nxt` and `el`, separated by a space. The `nxt` variable is used directly without any modification. The `el` variable is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`, so its value is specific to the iteration. The other variables `sv` and `vis` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` contains elements with `el` added; `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`; `vis` contains elements with `el` added and `res` contains the appended string formed by `nxt` and `el`.
Output State: **`sv` contains elements with `el` added; `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`; `vis` contains elements with `el` added and `res` contains the appended string formed by `nxt` and `el`**
