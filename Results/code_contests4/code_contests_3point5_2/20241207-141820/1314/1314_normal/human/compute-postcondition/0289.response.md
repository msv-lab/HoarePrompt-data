Example Answer:
The element `nxt` is removed from the list `dmain[el]`. The states of `sv`, `el`, `vis`, and `res` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` contains elements, `el` is the next element to be iterated, `vis` and `res` may have been modified.
Output State: **`sv` contains elements, `el` is the next element to be iterated, `vis` and `res` may have been modified**
