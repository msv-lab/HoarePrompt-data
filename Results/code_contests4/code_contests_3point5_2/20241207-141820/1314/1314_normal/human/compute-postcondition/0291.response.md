Example Answer: 
`el` is added to the set `sv`. The elements in `sv` are updated with the addition of `el`, and `el` is moved to the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` contains elements with `el` added; `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`.
Output State: **`sv` contains elements with `el` added; `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`**
