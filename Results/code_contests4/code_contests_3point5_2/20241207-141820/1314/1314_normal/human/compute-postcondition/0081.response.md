Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. The set `tov` now contains one more element. The other variables `nxt`, `ds`, `arr[el]`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` has an additional element added.
Output State: **`tov` has an additional element added**
