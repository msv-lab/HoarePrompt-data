According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tov`. If `tov` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tov` contains only the value `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `tov` needs to contain at least one more value in addition to `i`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` has been updated with `arr[i] = cur`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov` now contains the value `i` and at least one more value, `nxt` remains the same, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, all elements in `ds` have been processed**
