According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `ds[nxt]` is not empty. For the loop to execute again, the length of `tov` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `nxt` should be the value removed from `tov`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed, and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them, `i` and `cur` incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed, and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2**.
