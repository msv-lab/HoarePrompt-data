Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with `arr[el]` being equal to `cur`. `i` and `cur` are further incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with `el` added to it. `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` must still have elements. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the program continues with the specified state.***
