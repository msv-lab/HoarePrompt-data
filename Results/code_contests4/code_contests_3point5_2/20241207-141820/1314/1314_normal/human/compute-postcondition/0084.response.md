Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. The value of `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` is a non-empty value including the last element `nxt`, `ds` remains the same, for the next key in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`.
Output State: **`tov` is a non-empty value including the last element `nxt`, `ds` remains the same, for the next key in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`**
