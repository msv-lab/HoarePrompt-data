Example Answer:
The value of `nxt` is converted to a string and concatenated with the value of `el`, forming a new string that is appended to the `res` list. The `sv` variable and other elements are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` has additional elements including `el`; `el` is added to `vis` list, `res` has a new string appended.
Output State: **`sv` has additional elements including `el`; `el` is added to `vis` list, `res` has a new string appended**
