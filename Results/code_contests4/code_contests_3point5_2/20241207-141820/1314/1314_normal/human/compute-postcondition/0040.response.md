According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `tov` contains the value 2. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the length of `tov` must be greater than 0 before entering the loop again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `tov` contains the value 2 and the length of `tov` is greater than 0**
