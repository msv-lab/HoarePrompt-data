According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` has been updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt` remain the same, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, all elements in `ds` have been processed**
