Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` is a defaultdict containing sets where `ds[s]` contains all the values of `f` added throughout the loop. `dmain` is a defaultdict containing sets where `dmain[s]` contains the values of `f` added throughout the loop. The length of `dmain[1]` is less than `D`***
