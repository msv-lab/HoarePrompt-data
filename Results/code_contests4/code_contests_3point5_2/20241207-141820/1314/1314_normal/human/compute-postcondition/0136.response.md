Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the `tov` set. The element before the last element of `tov` is now stored in `nxt`, and `tov` is updated with the last element removed. The element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`.
Output State: **`nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`**
