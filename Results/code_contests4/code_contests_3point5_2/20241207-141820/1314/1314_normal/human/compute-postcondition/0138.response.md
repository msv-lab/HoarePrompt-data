According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `el`, `ds`, `nxt`, `tov`, `arr`, and `cur`. 

Based on the information provided:
- `nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`
- `tov` is updated with the last element removed
- The element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur` if the element at index `el` in array `arr` was originally 0

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `nxt` should be updated with the new element before the new last element of `tov`
- `tov` should be updated with the new last element removed
- The element at index `el` in array `arr` should be checked if it was originally 0 and assigned the value of `cur` if necessary

State: **`nxt` contains the new element before the new last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the new last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur` if the element at index `el` in array `arr` was originally 0**.
