Postcondition: ***`tov` is now a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` where `arr[el]` was equal to 0 before the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `el` is set to one of the keys in `ds` corresponding to `nxt`. Additionally, `arr[el]` is equal to 0***
