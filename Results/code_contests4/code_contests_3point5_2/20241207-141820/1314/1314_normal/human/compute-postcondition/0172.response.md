Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them, `i` and `cur` incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed, and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2. After the execution of the if block, the element at index 0 in `arr` is equal to the updated value of `cur` and `el` is added to the set `tov`.***
