The value `nxt` is assigned the last element of `tov` using the `pop()` method, which removes and returns the last element of the list. The lists `tov` and `arr` are modified accordingly. 
Output State: **`nxt` contains the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, `arr` is updated as specified**
