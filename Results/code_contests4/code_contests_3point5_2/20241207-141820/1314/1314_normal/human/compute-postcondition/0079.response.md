According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in `ds` corresponding to the value of `nxt`. If there are more keys in `ds` corresponding to `nxt`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `tov` is a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the last element that was removed from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, and `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` where `arr[el]` was equal to 0 before the loop. 

To execute the loop one more time, `ds` must have more keys corresponding to `nxt` and the next key must be selected for iteration.
State: **`tov` is a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the next element in `tov`, `ds` remains the same, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur` for the next key in `ds[nxt]`**
