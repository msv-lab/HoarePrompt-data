Example Answer:
`f` is added to the set `dmain[s]`. The values of `s` and `f` are obtained from splitting the input string by space. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `ds[f]` adds `s` to its set. The loop will execute a second time if `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` is a defaultdict containing at least one set where `ds[s]` contains `f`, `dmain` is a defaultdict containing at least one set where `dmain[s]` contains the value of `f`. `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1. `s` and `f` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string by space. `s` and `f` are not equal to 1. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `ds[f]` has added `s` to its set.
