Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. The values of `tov`, `nxt`, `ds`, `arr`, and `cur` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` is a non-empty set including the last element `nxt`, `ds` remains the same, for the next key in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, and `el` is added to `tov`.
Output State: **`tov` is a non-empty set including the last element `nxt`, `ds` remains the same, for the next key in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, `el` is added to `tov`**
