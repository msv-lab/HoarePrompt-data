According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `ds` and the value `nxt`. If `ds[nxt]` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the constraints ensure that `n`, `m`, and `D` are integers satisfying certain conditions. The other states need to be adjusted such that `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` is not empty for the loop to execute.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` has been updated, `i` and `cur` are incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` is not empty**
