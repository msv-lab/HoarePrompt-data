Example Answer:
`tov` is a set that contains elements, and `el` is added to `tov`. `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `tov` now contains an additional element which is `el+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `tov` contains elements including `el` and `el+1`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`, `tov` contains elements including `el` and `el+1`**
