According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. If there are more elements in `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them, `i` and `cur` incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed, and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2. After the execution of the if block, the element at index 0 in `arr` is equal to the updated value of `cur` and `el` is added to the set `tov`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the element `el` must exist in `ds[nxt]` and there must be more elements in `ds[nxt]` for the loop to iterate again.

State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them, `i` and `cur` incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed, and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2, `el` exists in `ds[nxt]` and there are more elements in `ds[nxt]` for the loop to execute another time**
