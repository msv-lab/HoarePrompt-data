According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ds`, `nxt`, `arr`, `el`, and `tov`. If `ds[nxt]` is not empty and `arr[el]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, `nxt`, `el` satisfy the given constraints. `arr[i]` is 1, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, and `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ds[nxt]` must still be non-empty, `arr[el]` must be equal to 0, and `tov` must contain `el`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict with keys having non-empty values for `nxt`, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` with the element at index `i` equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is less than `n + 1, `cur` is the last updated value of `el` which is incremented by 1, `tov` contains the value `i`, `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[i]` is equal to 1, `ds[nxt]` is not empty, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `tov` contains `el` for the loop to execute one more time**
