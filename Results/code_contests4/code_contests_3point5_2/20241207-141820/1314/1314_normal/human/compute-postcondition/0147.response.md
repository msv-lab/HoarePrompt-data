Example Answer: 
`cur` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` has been updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is increased by 1, `tov`, `nxt` remain the same, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, all elements in `ds` have been processed.
