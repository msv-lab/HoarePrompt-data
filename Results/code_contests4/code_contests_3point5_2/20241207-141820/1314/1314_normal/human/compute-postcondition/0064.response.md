Output State: **`tov` is empty, `nxt` is a value popped from `tov`, `ds` contains a key equal to `nxt` with corresponding non-empty value, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, and `tov` contains `el` if `arr[el]` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` must have another `el` where `arr[el]` is 0**
