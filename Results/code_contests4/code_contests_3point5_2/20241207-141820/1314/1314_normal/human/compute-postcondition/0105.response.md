Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` is a defaultdict with keys having non-empty values for `nxt`, `dmain` is a defaultdict. `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` with the element at index `i` equal to 1 if it has been updated. `i` is less than `n + 1. `cur` is the last updated value of `el` which is incremented by 1. `tov` contains the value `i`. `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`. `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, `arr[el]` is updated with the value `cur`, `arr[i]` is 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, `el` is added to the set `tov`.***
