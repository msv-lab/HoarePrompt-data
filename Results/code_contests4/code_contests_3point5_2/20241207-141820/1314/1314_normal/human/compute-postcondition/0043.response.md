Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `tov` contains the value 2 and the length of `tov` is greater than 0, `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the element at index `el` in `arr` is equal to 0***
