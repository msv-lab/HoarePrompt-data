Example Answer:
`sviaz` is updated by adding the element in `arr` at index `el`. If `arr[el]` is already in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` remains the same. The element `next_el` is removed from `dmain[1]`. 
Output State: **`sviaz` is updated with the element in `arr` at index `el`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `next_el`**
