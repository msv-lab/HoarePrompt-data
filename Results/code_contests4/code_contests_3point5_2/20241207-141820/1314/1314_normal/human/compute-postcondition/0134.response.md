According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]` and the value of `arr[el]`. If there are more elements in `ds[nxt]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed and `el` is added to it. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then the current value of `arr[el]` is `cur`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `ds[nxt]` needs to have more elements, and the value of `el` needs to be updated to the next element in `ds[nxt]`.
State: **`nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed and `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`**
