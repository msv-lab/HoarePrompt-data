According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `ds[nxt]`. If there are more elements in the list to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` is a non-empty value including the last element `nxt`, `ds` remains the same, `arr[el]` is equal to 0, and for the next key in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next key in `ds[nxt]` should be available to iterate over.
State: **`tov` is a non-empty value including the last element `nxt`, `ds` remains the same, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, for the next key in `ds[nxt]`, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur`**
