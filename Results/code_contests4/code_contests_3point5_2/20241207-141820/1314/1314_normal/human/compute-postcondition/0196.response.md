Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with `el` having a value of `cur`, `i` and `cur` are incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2. `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element. `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]` if it exists and meets the conditions. If `arr[el] == 0`, `el` is added to `tov`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
