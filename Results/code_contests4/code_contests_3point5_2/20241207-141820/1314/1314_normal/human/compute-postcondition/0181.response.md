Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers. `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them. `i` and `cur` are incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2. All elements in `ds[nxt]` have been checked and if `arr[el] == 0`, `el` is added to `tov` and `arr[el]` is assigned the value `cur`.**
