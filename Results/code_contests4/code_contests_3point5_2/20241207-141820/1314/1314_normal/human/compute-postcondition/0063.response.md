According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nxt`, `ds`, `arr`, and `tov`. If `ds[nxt]` is not empty and `arr[el]` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is a value popped from `tov`, `ds` contains a key equal to `nxt` with corresponding non-empty value, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` and `tov` contains `el` if `arr[el]` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `ds[nxt]` must still be non-empty and there must be another `el` in `ds[nxt]` that meets the condition `arr[el]` is 0.
State: **`tov` is empty, `nxt` is a value popped from `tov`, `ds` contains a key equal to `nxt` with corresponding non-empty value, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` and `tov` contains `el` if `arr[el]` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` must have another `el` where `arr[el]` is 0**
