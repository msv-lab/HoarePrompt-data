Example Answer:
The element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`, but only if the original value at that index was 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nxt` contains the new element before the new last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the new last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur` if the element at index `el` in array `arr` was originally 0.
Output State: **`nxt` contains the new element before the new last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the new last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur` if the element at index `el` in array `arr` was originally 0**
