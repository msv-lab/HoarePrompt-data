According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `tov`. If the length of `tov` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their original values. For the loop to execute one more time, `tov` should contain elements that met the condition in the loop body, and `arr` should be updated with the value of `cur` at the indices specified by the elements in `ds[nxt]` that meet the condition `arr[el] == 0`.
State: **All variables maintain their original values, for the loop to execute again `tov` should contain elements meeting the condition and `arr` should be updated as specified**
