According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `dmain`, `nxt`, `el`, and `vis`. If `dmain[nxt]` has elements, `nxt` contains an element popped from `sv`, `el` is not in `vis`, and `el` has been added to `vis`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `sviaz` contains elements from `arr` at certain indices, `ite` is empty, `el` is the last element iterated in the loop, `dmain[1]` may have elements removed, `sv` may have one less element, `vis` contains the element 1, `res` is a list containing the string 'YES' with the appended values of `nxt` and `el`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `dmain[nxt]` has elements present at index `nxt`, `nxt` contains the element popped from `sv`, `el` is not in `vis`, and `el` has been added to `vis`.

State: **`sviaz` contains elements from `arr` at certain indices, `ite` is empty, `el` is the last element iterated in the loop, `dmain[1]` may have elements removed, `sv` may have one less element, `vis` contains the element 1, `res` is a list containing the string 'YES' with the appended values of `nxt` and `el`, for the loop to execute the second time `dmain[nxt]` has elements present at index `nxt`, `nxt` contains the element popped from `sv`, `el` is not in `vis`, `el` has been added to `vis`**
