Example Answer:
`el` is added to the set `tov`. If `arr[el]` was 0, then `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables maintain their original values, `arr` updated based on conditions in the loop, `tov` contains elements, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in the list.
Output State: **All variables maintain their original values, `arr` updated based on conditions in the loop, `tov` contains elements, for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 1 element, `el` is the first element in the list.**
