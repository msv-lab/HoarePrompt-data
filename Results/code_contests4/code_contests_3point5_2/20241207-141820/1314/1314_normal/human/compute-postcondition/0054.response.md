Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`, `i` is 3, `cur` is equal to the updated value of `el`, for the loop to execute the third time `tov` contains the next value from `ds[nxt]` and the length of `tov` is greater than 0, `nxt` is equal to the next value popped from `tov`, the element at index `el` in `arr` is equal to 1, `el` is the next updated value from `ds[nxt]`, `tov` contains the next updated value `el` if the element at index `el` in `arr` was initially 0. If the element at index `el` in `arr` was initially 0, then the element at index `el` in `arr` is updated to 1.***
