Example Answer:
The value of `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, `arr` is updated as specified. For the loop to execute the first time `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. When the if condition is met, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`.
Output State: **`nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, `arr` is updated as specified. For the loop to execute the first time `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. When the if condition is met, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`**
