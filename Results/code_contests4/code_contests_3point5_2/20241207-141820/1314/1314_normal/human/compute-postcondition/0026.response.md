Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `D` is an integer, `ds` is a defaultdict containing updated sets, `dmain` is a defaultdict containing at least one set where `dmain[s]` contains the value of `f`, `s` and `f` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by space, `s` and `f` are not equal to 1. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `ds[f]` has added `s` to its set. Additionally, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and if `s` is not equal to 1 and `f` is not equal to 1, then `ds[f]` has added `s` to its set. `f` is added to the set `dmain[s].**
