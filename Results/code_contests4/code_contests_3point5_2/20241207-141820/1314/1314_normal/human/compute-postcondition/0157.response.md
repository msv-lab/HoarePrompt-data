According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `el`, `nxt`, and the dictionary `ds`. If there are still elements in `ds[nxt]`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `D`, `ds`, `dmain`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov`, and `nxt` have been updated as described. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with `arr[el]` being equal to `cur`. `i` and `cur` are further incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with `el` added to it. `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time `ds[nxt]` must still have elements**.
