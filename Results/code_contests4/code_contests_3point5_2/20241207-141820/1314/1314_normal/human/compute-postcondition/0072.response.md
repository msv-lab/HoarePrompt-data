According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `tov` is greater than 0. However, since the loop does not execute again, it means that the length of `tov` is currently 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `tov` needs to be adjusted to a non-empty value.
State: **`tov` needs to be a non-empty value, `nxt` is None, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur` for all `el` where `arr[el]` was equal to 0 before the loop, and the loop does not execute again**.
