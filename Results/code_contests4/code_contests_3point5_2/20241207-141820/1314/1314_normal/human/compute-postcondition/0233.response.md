According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `dmain` at index `nxt`. If there are elements present at that index, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted are `nxt` and ensuring that there are elements at the specified index in `dmain` for the loop to execute successfully.

State: **`sviaz` contains elements from `arr` at certain indices, `ite` is empty, `el` is the last element iterated in the loop, `dmain[1]` may have elements removed depending on the condition met in the loop, `sv` may have one less element, `vis` contains the element 1, `res` is a list containing the string 'YES', for the loop to execute the first time `dmain[nxt]` has elements present at index `nxt`, `nxt` contains the element popped from `sv`**
