According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ite` and `el`, as well as the conditions related to `sviaz`, `arr`, and `dmain`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `sviaz` is a set, `ite` is not empty, and `el` is the first element in `ite`. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `el`. If `arr[el]` is already in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` is an empty set and `dmain[1]` no longer contains `el`.

To execute the loop one more time, the next `el` in `ite` needs to be considered. Since the loop proceeds to the next element in `ite`, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

State: **`sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `next_el`, where `next_el` is the next element in `ite` after `el`.**
