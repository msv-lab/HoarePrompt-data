Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. The set `tov` now contains `el` in addition to its previous values. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` has been updated with `el` having a value of `cur`, `i` and `cur` are incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]` if it exists and meets the conditions, `el` is added to `tov` if `arr[el] == 0`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` has been updated with `el` having a value of `cur`, `i` and `cur` are incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds`, `ds[nxt]` has at least 1 element, `el` is the second element in `ds[nxt]` if it exists and meets the conditions, `el` is added to `tov` if `arr[el] == 0, `el` is added to `tov`**
