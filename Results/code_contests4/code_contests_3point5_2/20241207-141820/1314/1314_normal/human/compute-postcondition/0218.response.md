Example Answer: 
The element `el` is removed from `dmain[1]`. The values of `sviaz`, `arr`, and `ite` are not affected by this operation, but the state of `dmain[1]` changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `el`.
Output State: **`sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `el`**
