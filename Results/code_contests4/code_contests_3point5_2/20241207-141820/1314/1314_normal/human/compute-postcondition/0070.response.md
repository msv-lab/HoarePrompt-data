Postcondition: ***`tov` is empty, `nxt` is a value popped from `tov`, `ds` contains a key equal to `nxt` with corresponding non-empty value, `arr[el]` is equal to `cur`, and `tov` contains `el` if `arr[el]` is 0. The loop will execute one more time if `ds[nxt]` has another `el` where `arr[el]` is 0 after the if statement is executed.***
