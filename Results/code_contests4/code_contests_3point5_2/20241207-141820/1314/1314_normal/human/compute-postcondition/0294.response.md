Postcondition: ***`sv` contains elements with `el` added, `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`, `vis` contains elements with `el` added, `res` contains the appended string formed by `nxt` and `el` if `el` is not in `vis`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
