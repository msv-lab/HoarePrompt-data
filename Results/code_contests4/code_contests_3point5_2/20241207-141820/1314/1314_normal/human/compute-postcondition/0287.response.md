Example Answer:
The code appends the string representation of `nxt` followed by a space and the string representation of `el` to the list `res`. The elements of `sv` and the value of `el` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sv` has elements including `el`, `el` is added to the set, `res` has the new string appended.
Output State: **`sv` has elements including `el`, `el` is added to the set, `res` has the new string appended**
