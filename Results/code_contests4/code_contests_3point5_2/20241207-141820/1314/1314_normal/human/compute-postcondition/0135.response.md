Example Answer: 
The element at index `el` in the array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`. The value of `el` is the next element in `ds[nxt]`, the value of `cur` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, and the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`.
Output State: **`nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`**
