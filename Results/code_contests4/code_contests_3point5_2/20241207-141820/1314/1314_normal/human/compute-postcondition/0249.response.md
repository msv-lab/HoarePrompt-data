Example Answer:
The code appends the string representation of `nxt` followed by a space and `el` to the list `res`. As per the initial state, `nxt` contains the element popped from `sv` and `el` has been added to `vis` and `sv`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the list `res` will have the string 'YES' with appended values of `nxt` and `el`.
Output State: **`res` contains the string 'YES' with appended values of `nxt` and `el`**
