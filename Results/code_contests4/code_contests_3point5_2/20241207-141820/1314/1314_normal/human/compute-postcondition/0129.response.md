According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds` at index `nxt`. If the list at index `nxt` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the state before the loop starts for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made: 
- `el` should be the first element in `ds[nxt]`
- `nxt` should be updated to remove the last element from `tov`
- `tov` should be updated to remove its last element
- `arr` should be updated as specified

State: **`nxt` contains the element before the last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the last element removed, `arr` is updated as specified, for the loop to execute the first time `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`**
