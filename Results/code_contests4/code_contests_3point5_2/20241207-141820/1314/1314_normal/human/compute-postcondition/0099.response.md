Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict with keys having non-empty values for `nxt`, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` with the element at index `i` equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is less than `n + 1, `cur` is the last updated value of `el` which is incremented by 1, `tov` contains the value `i`, `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[i]` is equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is not empty, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. Additionally, `arr[el]` is equal to 0, and `arr[el]` is assigned the value of `cur`.**
