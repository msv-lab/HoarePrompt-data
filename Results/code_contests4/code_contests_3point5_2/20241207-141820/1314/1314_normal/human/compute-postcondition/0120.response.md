Example Answer:
The element `el` is added to the set `tov`. This means `el` is now included in the elements contained in `tov`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables maintain their original values, `arr` is updated with the value of `cur` at index `el` if `arr[el]` was equal to 0, `tov` contains elements, for the loop to execute the second time `ds[nxt]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `el` is the second element in the list, `el` is added to the set `tov`.
