Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with `cur` assigned to the `el` index. `i` and `cur` are incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with `el` added to it. `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` is not empty. For the loop to execute again, `ds[nxt]` must still have elements. If `arr[el]` is equal to 0, then the program updates the necessary variables as described above.***
