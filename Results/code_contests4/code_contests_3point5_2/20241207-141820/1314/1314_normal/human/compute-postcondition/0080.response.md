Example Answer:
`arr[el]` is now assigned the value of `cur` for the next key in `ds[nxt]`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `tov` is a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the next element in `tov`, `ds` remains the same, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur` for the next key in `ds[nxt]`.
Output State: **`tov` is a non-empty value without the last element, `nxt` is the next element in `tov`, `ds` remains the same, `arr[el]` is now equal to `cur` for the next key in `ds[nxt]**
