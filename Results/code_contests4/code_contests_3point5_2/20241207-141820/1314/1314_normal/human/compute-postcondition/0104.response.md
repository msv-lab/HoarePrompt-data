Example Answer:
The value of `el` is added to the set `tov`. The values of `arr[el]`, `arr[i]`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr[el]` is updated with the value `cur`, `arr[i]` is 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, `el` is added to the set `tov`.
Output State: **`arr[el]` is updated with the value `cur`, `arr[i]` is 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, `el` is added to the set `tov`**
