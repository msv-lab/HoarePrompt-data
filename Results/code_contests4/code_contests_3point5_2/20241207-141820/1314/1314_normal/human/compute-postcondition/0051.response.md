According to the code, the loop execution depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. If there are more elements in `ds[nxt]`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the given states are:
- `n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints,
- `ds` is a defaultdict,
- `dmain` is a defaultdict,
- `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`,
- `i` is 2,
- `cur` is 1,
- for the loop to execute the second time `tov` contains the value 2 and the length of `tov` is greater than 0,
- `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`,
- the element at index `el` in `arr` is equal to 1,
- `el` is the updated value from `tov`,
- `tov` contains the updated value `el` if the element at index `el` in `arr` was initially 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increase the value of `i` by 1: `i` should be 3.
- Update the value of `cur` to `el` since the loop is based on the elements in `ds[nxt]`: `cur` should be equal to `el`.
- Update `el` with the next value from `ds[nxt]`: `el` should be updated to the next value in `ds[nxt]`.
- Make sure `tov` contains the updated `el` value: `tov` should be updated with the next value from `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`, `i` is 3, `cur` is equal to the updated value of `el`, for the loop to execute the third time `tov` contains the next value from `ds[nxt]` and the length of `tov` is greater than 0, `nxt` is equal to the next value popped from `tov`, the element at index `el` in `arr` is equal to 1, `el` is the next updated value from `ds[nxt]`, `tov` contains the next updated value `el` if the element at index `el` in `arr` was initially 0**
