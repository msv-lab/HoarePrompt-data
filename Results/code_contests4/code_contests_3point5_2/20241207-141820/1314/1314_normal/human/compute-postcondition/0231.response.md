According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `sv` is not zero. Right before the loop, `sv` contains the element 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to ensure that `sv` still contains elements other than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sviaz` contains elements from `arr` at certain indices, `ite` is empty, `el` is the last element iterated in the loop, `dmain[1]` may have elements removed depending on the condition met in the loop, `sv` contains elements other than 1, `vis` contains the element 1, `res` is a list containing the string 'YES'**
