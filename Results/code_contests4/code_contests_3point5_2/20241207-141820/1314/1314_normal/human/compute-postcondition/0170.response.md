Example Answer:
The element at index `el` in the list `arr` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is being incremented. Since the element `el` is known to be equal to 0, after execution, the element at index 0 in `arr` will be updated to the new value of `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them, `i` and `cur` incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed, and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2, the element at index 0 in `arr` is now equal to the updated value of `cur`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them, `i` and `cur` incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed, and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2, the element at index 0 in `arr` is now equal to the updated value of `cur`**
