Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints. `ds` is a defaultdict containing sets where `ds[s]` contains all the values of `f` added throughout the loop. `dmain` is a defaultdict containing sets where `dmain[s]` contains the values of `f` added throughout the loop. If the length of `dmain[1]` is less than `D`, 'NO' is printed. `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros.**
