According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]`. If `ds[nxt]` still has elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `D`, `arr`, `i`, `cur`, `tov` are updated as described, and `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` with `ds[nxt]` not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `ds[nxt]` must still have elements.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` has been updated, `i` and `cur` are incremented, `tov` contains at least 2 values with `el` added to it, `nxt` is a valid key in `ds` and `ds[nxt]` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `ds[nxt]` must still have elements**.
