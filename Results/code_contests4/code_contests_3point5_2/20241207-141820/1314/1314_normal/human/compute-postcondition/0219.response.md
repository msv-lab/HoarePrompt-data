Postcondition: ***`sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `next_el`, where `next_el` is the next element in `ite` after `el`. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` has been updated by adding the element in `arr` at index `el`. Otherwise, `sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, and `dmain[1]` no longer contains `el`.***
