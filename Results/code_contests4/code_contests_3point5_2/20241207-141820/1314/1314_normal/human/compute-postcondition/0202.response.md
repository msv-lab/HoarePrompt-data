Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `D` are integers. `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where each element represents the group number it belongs to. `i` equals `n`, `cur` is the total number of groups, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is None. All elements in `ds` have been processed and grouped accordingly, and all elements in `arr` have been updated with their corresponding group numbers. `cur` is greater than `D`***
