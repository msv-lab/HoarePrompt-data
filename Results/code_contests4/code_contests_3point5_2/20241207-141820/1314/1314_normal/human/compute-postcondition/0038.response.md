Example Answer:
The set `tov` is initialized with the value `{i}`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, the set `tov` now contains the value 2.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. The element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to 0, `tov` contains the value 2**
