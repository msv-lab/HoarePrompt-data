Example Answer:
The element at index `el` in array `arr` is updated with the value of `cur` only if the original value was 0. The new last element of `tov` is `el` after adding it. The new element before the new last element of `tov` is then assigned to `nxt`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nxt` contains the new element before the new last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the new last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur` if the element at index `el` in array `arr` was originally 0.
Output State: **`nxt` contains the new element before the new last element of `tov`, `tov` is updated with the new last element removed, the element at index `el` in array `arr` is assigned the value of `cur` if the element at index `el` in array `arr` was originally 0**
