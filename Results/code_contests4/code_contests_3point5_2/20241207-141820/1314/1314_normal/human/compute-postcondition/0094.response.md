Example Answer:
`arr[i]` is assigned the value of `cur`, which means the element at index `i` in the list `arr` is updated with the value of `cur`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is less than `n + 1`, `cur` is the last updated value of `el` which is incremented by 1, `tov` contains the value `i`, `nxt` is None, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[i]` is equal to 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is less than `n + 1`, `cur` is the last updated value of `el` which is incremented by 1, `tov` contains the value `i`, `nxt` is None, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[i]` is equal to 1**.
