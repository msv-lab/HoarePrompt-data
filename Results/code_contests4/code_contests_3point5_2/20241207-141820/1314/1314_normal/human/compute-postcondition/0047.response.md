According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ds[nxt]` and the values in `arr`. If the element at index `el` in `arr` is equal to 0, then `tov` contains the updated value of `el` for the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, `tov` contains the value 2 and the length of `tov` is greater than 0, `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`, and `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the element at index `el` in `arr` should be equal to 0 so that `tov` contains the updated value of `el` for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the element at index `el` in `arr` should be equal to 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `tov` contains the value 2 and the length of `tov` is greater than 0, `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`, the element at index `el` in `arr` is equal to 0, `el` is the updated value from `tov`.**
