Example Answer:
The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is 0, so after execution, `cur` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. The element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to 0.**
