Example Answer: 
The code snippet `sys.stdin = BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())` redirects the standard input to a BytesIO object. This can be useful for testing purposes or when input needs to be read from a different source. Since no other variables are affected, the initial state remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: n, m, D are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2)), 1 ≤ D < n. The input edges are represented as pairs of integers v_i, u_i (1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i).**
