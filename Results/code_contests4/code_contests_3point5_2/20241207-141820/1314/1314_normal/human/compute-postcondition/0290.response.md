According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `dmain[nxt]`. If there are more elements to iterate, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `sv` contains elements, `el` is the next element to be iterated. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `el` needs to be updated to the next element in `dmain[nxt]`. If there are more elements to iterate, the loop will continue. `vis` and `res` may have been modified during the iteration.

State: **`sv` contains elements, `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`**.
