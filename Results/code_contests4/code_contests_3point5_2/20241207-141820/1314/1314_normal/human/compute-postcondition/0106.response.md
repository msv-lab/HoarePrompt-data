According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `ds[nxt]` for `el` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n`, `m`, `D` remain unchanged.
- `ds` still has keys with non-empty values for `nxt`.
- `dmain` remains unchanged.
- `arr` has been updated with `arr[el]` equal to 1 if it has been updated during the last iteration.
- `i` remains less than `n + 1`.
- `cur` has been incremented by 1 after updating `arr[el]`.
- `tov` contains the value `i`.
- `nxt` has been updated with the value popped from `tov`.
- `ds` still has keys with corresponding non-empty values.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- The next element in `ds[nxt]` needs to be selected for `el` to iterate over.
- `cur` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The value of `el` that has been iterated over should be added to the set `tov`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `D` remain the same. `ds` still has keys with non-empty values for `nxt`. `dmain` remains unchanged. `arr` has been updated with `arr[el]` equal to 1 if it has been updated during the last iteration. `i` remains less than `n + 1. `cur` is incremented by 1. `tov` contains the next value for `el` iteration. `nxt` is updated. Keys in `ds` are maintained.**
