According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ds[nxt]`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the variable `nxt` needs to be adjusted to contain a valid value popped from `tov`. Additionally, for the loop to execute the first time, `el` needs to be equal to the first element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to `cur`, `i` is 2, `cur` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `tov` contains the value 2 and the length of `tov` is greater than 0, `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`**
