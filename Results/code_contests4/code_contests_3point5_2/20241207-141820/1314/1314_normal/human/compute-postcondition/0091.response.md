According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`. Additionally, since `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` and the element at index `i` is equal to 1 if it has been updated, `arr[i]` needs to be updated to 1 for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is less than `n + 1`, `cur` is the last updated value of `el`, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is None, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[i]` is equal to 1**.
