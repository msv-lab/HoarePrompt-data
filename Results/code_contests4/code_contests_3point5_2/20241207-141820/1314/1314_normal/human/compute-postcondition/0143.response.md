Output State: **All variables maintain their original values except for `arr`, which has been updated based on the conditions in the loop. The loop iterates through all elements in `ds[nxt]`, updating `arr` for elements with `arr[el]` equal to 0 and adding them to `tov`. `nxt` will be None, `tov` will be empty, and all elements in `ds` will have been processed.**
