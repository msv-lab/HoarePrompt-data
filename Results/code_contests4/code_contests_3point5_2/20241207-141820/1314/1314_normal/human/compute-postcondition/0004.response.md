Example Answer:
`dmain` is assigned an empty set. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, D are integers satisfying the given constraints, ds is a defaultdict containing sets; dmain is a defaultdict containing an empty set.
Output State: **n, m, D are integers satisfying the given constraints, ds is a defaultdict containing sets; dmain is a defaultdict containing an empty set**
