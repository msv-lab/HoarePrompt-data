According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `tov` is non-zero. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `tov` needs to be adjusted to be greater than zero. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers. `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with all elements in `ds` having `cur` assigned to them. `i` and `cur` are incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute again the length of `tov` is greater than zero**
