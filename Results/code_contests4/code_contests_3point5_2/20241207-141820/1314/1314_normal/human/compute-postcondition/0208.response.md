According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ite` variable. If `ite` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sviaz` is an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `ite` is not empty. For the loop to execute the first time, `el` should be the first element in `ite`.
State: **`sviaz` is an empty set, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the first element in `ite` for the loop to execute the first time**
