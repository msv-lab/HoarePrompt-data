According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if the length of `tov` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `tov` is empty. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `tov` needs to be adjusted to have a length greater than 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is equal to the number of elements updated in the loop, `cur` is the last updated value of `el`, for the loop to execute the last time `tov` is empty, `nxt` is None, `el` is the last updated value from `ds[nxt]` if the loop executed at least once and for the loop to execute one more time `tov` needs to have a length greater than 0**.
