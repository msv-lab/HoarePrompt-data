According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `ds` and `nxt`. If `ds` contains a key equal to `nxt` and the corresponding value is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the constraints of the integers `n`, `m`, and `D` being satisfied do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. The defaultdict `dmain` being empty and `arr` being a list of size `n + 1` do not directly impact the execution of the loop. The variables `i` and `cur` do not have a direct effect on the loop execution at the start. The condition for the loop to execute the last time is that `tov` is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to `tov` being empty at the start. For the loop to execute the first time, `nxt` needs to be a value popped from `tov`. The variable `el` will take the last updated value from `ds[nxt]` if the loop has executed at least once. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`tov` is empty, `nxt` is a value popped from `tov`, for the loop to execute the first time `ds` contains a key equal to `nxt` and the corresponding value is not empty**
