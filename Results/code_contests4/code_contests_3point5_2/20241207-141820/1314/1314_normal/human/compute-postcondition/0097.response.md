According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `ds` and `nxt`. If `ds[nxt]` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ds` should contain keys with corresponding non-empty values for `nxt`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `el` should be equal to the first element in `ds[nxt]`.

State: **Output State: `n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` is a defaultdict with keys having non-empty values for `nxt`, `dmain` is a defaultdict, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` with the element at index `i` equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is less than `n + 1, `cur` is the last updated value of `el` which is incremented by 1, `tov` contains the value `i`, `nxt` is equal to the value popped from `tov`, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[i]` is equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time `ds[nxt]` is not empty, `el` is the first element in `ds[nxt]`.**
