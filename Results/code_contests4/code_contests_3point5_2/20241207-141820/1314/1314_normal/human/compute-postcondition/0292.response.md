Example Answer: 
The element `el` is added to the set `vis`. The previous state of `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`. Therefore, after execution, the set `vis` contains the updated elements with `el` added.
Output State: **`sv` contains elements with `el` added; `el` is the next element to be iterated in `dmain[nxt]`; `vis` contains elements with `el` added**
