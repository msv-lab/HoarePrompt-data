Example Answer: 
A new empty set `vis` is created. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `sviaz` contains elements from `arr` at certain indices, `ite` is empty, `el` is the last element iterated in the loop, `dmain[1]` may have elements removed depending on the condition met in the loop, `sv` contains the element 1, `vis` is an empty set.
