According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `el`, `arr`, `sviaz`, `dmain`, and `ite`. The next element in `ite` after `el` is important for determining the loop continuation. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is described as `sviaz` containing the element in `arr` at index `next_el` or `sviaz` being an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, and `dmain[1]` no longer contains `next_el` if `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`. If `arr[el]` is in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_el` or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, and `dmain[1]` no longer contains `el`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in `ite` after the current `el`. 

State: **`sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `next_next_el`, or `sviaz` is an empty set if `arr[next_next_el]` is already in `sviaz`, `dmain[1]` no longer contains `next_el`, where `next_next_el` is the element after the next element in `ite` after `el`.**
