Example Answer:
The lambda function `input` is defined to read input from the standard input and strip any trailing newline characters. The variables n, m, and D are described in the preconditions and are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: Precondition: n, m, D are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2)), 1 ≤ D < n. The input edges are represented as pairs of integers v_i, u_i (1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i).
Output State: **Precondition: n, m, D are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ min(2 ⋅ 10^5, (n(n-1))/(2)), 1 ≤ D < n. The input edges are represented as pairs of integers v_i, u_i (1 ≤ v_i, u_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i)**
