Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries. `arr` has been updated with elements from `ds` having values of `cur`. `i` and `cur` are incremented. `tov` contains at least 2 values with `nxt` removed and the length of `tov` is greater than or equal to 2. The loop will execute if `tov` is not empty. If the loop executes, all elements in `ds` that meet the condition will have values of `cur` in `arr` and will be added to `tov` if their value in `arr` was previously 0.**
