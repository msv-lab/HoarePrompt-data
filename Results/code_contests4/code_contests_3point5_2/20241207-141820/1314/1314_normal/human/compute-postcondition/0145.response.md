Output State: **`n`, `m`, `D` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `ds` and `dmain` are default dictionaries, `arr` is a list of size `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is equal to 1 if it has been updated, `i` is less than `n + 1`, `cur` is the last updated value of `el`, `tov` is empty, `nxt` is None, `ds` contains keys with corresponding non-empty values, `arr[i]` is equal to 1. After the execution of the if else block, all variables maintain their original values except for `arr`, which has been updated based on the conditions in the loop. The loop iterates through all elements in `ds[nxt]`, updating `arr` for elements with `arr[el]` equal to 0 and adding them to `tov`. `nxt` will be None, `tov` will be empty, and all elements in `ds` will have been processed.**
