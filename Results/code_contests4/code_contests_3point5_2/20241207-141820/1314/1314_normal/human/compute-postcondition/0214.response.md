Postcondition: ***`sviaz` is a set, `ite` is not empty, `el` is the first element in `ite` for the loop to execute the first time. If `arr[el]` is not in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` contains the element in `arr` at index `el`. If `arr[el]` is already in `sviaz`, then `sviaz` is an empty set and `dmain[1]` no longer contains `el`.***
