According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `__author__` is 'Rikishi' and `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized with zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized with zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
