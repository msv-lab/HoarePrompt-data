Example Answer:
A 26x26 matrix `dyn` is initialized with each element set to 0. The variable `__author__` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized with zeros.
Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix initialized with zeros**
