According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1.
State: **__author__ is 'Rikishi', dyn is a 26x26 matrix initialized with zeros, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned the value of the string input from the user, `first` is assigned the ordinal value of the first character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `last` is assigned the ordinal value of the last character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a'. If `dyn[1][first] > 0`, then `dyn[1][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[1][first]` plus the length of string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time `j` is 1**
