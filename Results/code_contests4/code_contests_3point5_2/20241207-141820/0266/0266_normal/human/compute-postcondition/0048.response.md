Postcondition: ***After the if block executes, `author` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix with certain elements updated, `n` is greater than the next value of `i`, `s` is assigned the value of the string input from the user, `first` is assigned the ordinal value of the first character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `last` is the ordinal value of the last character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 2, the value in the `0`th row and `first` column of `dyn` is greater than 0, and the value in the `last` column of the `0`th row in `dyn` is updated to be the value in the `first` column of the `0`th row in `dyn` plus the length of string `s`.***
