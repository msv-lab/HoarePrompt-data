Example Answer:
`dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of string `s`. If `dyn[j][first] > 0`, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated accordingly. The value of `j` is 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time. The other variables remain as described above. 
Output State: **__author__ is 'Rikishi', dyn is a 26x26 matrix initialized with zeros, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned the value of the string input from the user, `first` is assigned the ordinal value of the first character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `last` is assigned the ordinal value of the last character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `dyn[j][last]` is updated based on the conditions, `j` is 1.**
