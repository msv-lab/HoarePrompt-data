Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of sequences to be processed. Each sequence consists of non-empty lowercase Latin letters, with each sequence not exceeding 10 characters. The function then constructs a 26x26 matrix `dyn` based on the input sequences, updating its elements according to certain conditions. Finally, it calculates the maximum value of the main diagonal elements in the matrix `dyn` and prints this value as the output. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
