Example Answer:
The value of `dyn[first][last]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of string `s`. The values of `author`, `n`, `s`, `first`, and `last` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `author` remains 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 matrix with certain elements updated based on the conditions in the loop, `n` is still greater than the next value of `i`, `s` retains the value of the string input from the user, `first` maintains the ordinal value of the first character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `last` preserves the ordinal value of the last character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a'.
