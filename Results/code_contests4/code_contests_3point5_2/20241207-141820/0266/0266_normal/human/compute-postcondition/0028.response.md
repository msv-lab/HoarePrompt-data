Example Answer:
`dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`, where `len(s)` is the length of the string input by the user. The values of `j`, `first`, and `last` are already assigned their respective values. After execution, the element at position `dyn[j][last]` in the matrix is updated with the sum of the element at position `dyn[j][first]` and the length of the string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: __author__ is 'Rikishi', dyn is a 26x26 matrix with updated elements, n is greater than the next value of `i`, s is assigned the value of the string input from the user, first is assigned the ordinal value of the first character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', last is assigned the ordinal value of the last character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
