Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, an error will occur during execution. The value of `__author__` is 'Rikishi' and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `__author__` is 'Rikishi'.
Output State: **`__author__` is 'Rikishi'**
