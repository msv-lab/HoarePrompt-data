Output State: **__author__ is 'Rikishi', dyn is a 26x26 matrix initialized with zeros, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned the value of the string input from the user, `first` is assigned the ordinal value of the first character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `last` is assigned the ordinal value of the last character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a'. If `dyn[1][first] > 0`, then `dyn[1][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[1][first]` plus the length of string `s`. `j` is 1, and `dyn[j][last]` is assigned the value of `dyn[j][first]` plus the length of string `s`.**
