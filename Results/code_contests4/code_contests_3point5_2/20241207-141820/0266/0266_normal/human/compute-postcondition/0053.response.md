Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value of the diagonal elements of the matrix `dyn`. Therefore, the program will output the maximum value of the diagonal elements of the matrix `dyn`.
Output State: **The program will output the maximum value of the diagonal elements of the matrix `dyn`**
