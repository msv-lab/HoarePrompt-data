Postcondition: ***__author__ is 'Rikishi', dyn is a 26x26 matrix with updated elements, n is greater than the next value of `i`, s is assigned the value of the string input from the user, first is assigned the ordinal value of the first character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', last is assigned the ordinal value of the last character of string `s` minus the ordinal value of 'a', `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, the element at dyn[1][first] must be greater than 0. Additionally, if dyn[j][first] > 0, dyn[j][last] is assigned the value of dyn[j][first] + len(s).***
