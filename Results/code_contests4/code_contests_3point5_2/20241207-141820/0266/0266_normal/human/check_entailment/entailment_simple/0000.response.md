Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It initializes a 26x26 matrix to keep track of the maximum length of the dynasty names. It then iterates through the input abbreviated names, updates the matrix based on the rules mentioned in the problem description, and finally calculates the maximum length of the dynasty names. The program outputs the correct length of the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.
