Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input n, m and a list of pairs of colors that harmonize with each other. It then creates a list of rooks for each color, ensuring that each color has at least one rook on the board. The program then assigns rooks to pairs of colors that harmonize with each other, ensuring that the union of rooks for each pair is connected.

The program then prints the rooks for each color in the required format. The logic of the program seems to follow the problem description accurately, creating a valid arrangement of rooks on the chessboard.
