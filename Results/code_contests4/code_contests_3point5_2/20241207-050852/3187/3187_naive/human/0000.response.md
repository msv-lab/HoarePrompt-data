Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values for the number of colors and pairs of harmonizing colors. It then generates the rooks arrangement based on the given conditions. For each color, it ensures that there is a rook of that color on the board and that the set of rooks of the same color is connected. It also ensures that the union of sets of rooks of different harmonizing colors is connected only when those colors harmonize with each other. The program then prints the rooks arrangement as required. The logic provided in the program covers all the conditions mentioned in the problem description, so it is correct for all potential cases.
