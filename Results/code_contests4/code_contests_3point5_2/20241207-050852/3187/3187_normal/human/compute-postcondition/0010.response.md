According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `edges` list. If the list has at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `edges`, and `ans` states do not change. So, for the loop to be executed the first time, the `edges` list must have at least 1 sublist, and `i` is 0 and `j` is the first sublist in the `edges` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), `edges` is a list of sublists with necessary information for the final value of `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` lists where the `i-1`th list contains the sublist `[i, i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, for the loop to execute the first time the `edges` list has at least 1 sublist, `i` is 0, and `j` is the first sublist in the `edges` list**
