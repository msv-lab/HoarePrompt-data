Example Answer:
The code prints the elements in the list `j` separated by a space. The value of `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]`, and `ans[i]` has at least 1 element. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]` and the elements of `j` are printed separated by a space.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]` and the elements of `j` are printed separated by a space**
