According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `ans` has at least `i+1` elements and the `i-th` element of `ans` is also a list. Before the loop starts, `i` is increased by the total number of iterations plus 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `ans` has at least `i+1` elements, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations plus 1, and `j` is the first element in the `i-th` element of `ans`.
State: **`n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 2, `i` is increased by the total number of iterations plus 1, `ans` is a list of lists where `ans` has at least `i+1` elements and the `i-th` element of `ans` is a list, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the first element in the `i-th` element of `ans`**
