Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by the function `rints()`. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2).
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2)**
