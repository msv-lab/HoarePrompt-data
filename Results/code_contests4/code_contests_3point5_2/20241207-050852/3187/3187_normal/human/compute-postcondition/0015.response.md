Example Answer:
A new sublist is appended to the sublist at index j[1] - 1 in the list `ans`. The new sublist contains two elements, where the first element is the sum of i, n, and 1, and the second element is the value of j[1]. The previous values of i, n, and j[1] are used to calculate the result. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist, and a new sublist is appended to one of the lists in `ans`**.
