According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `edges` list. If there are more sublists in the `edges` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `edges` is a list of sublists. For the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more sublist in the `edges` list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist, `ans` is a list of `n` lists with a new sublist appended to one of the lists**
