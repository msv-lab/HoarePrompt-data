According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ans[i]`. If the list `ans[i]` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `ans[i]` needs to have at least 1 element and `j` needs to be the first element in the list `ans[i]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ans[i]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]`**
