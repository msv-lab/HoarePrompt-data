Example Answer:
A new sublist is appended to the sublist at index `j[0] - 1` in the list `ans`. The new sublist contains two elements: `i + n + 1` and `j[0]`. The values of `n` and `m` are used in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist and a new sublist is appended to one of the lists in `ans` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist and a new sublist is appended to one of the lists in `ans` for the loop to execute again**
