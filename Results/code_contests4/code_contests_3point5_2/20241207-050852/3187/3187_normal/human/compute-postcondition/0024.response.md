According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ans[i]`. If `i` is less than the length of `ans`, and `ans[i]` has elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ans[i]` is a list with at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `ans[i]` must be a list with at least 1 element.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]`**
