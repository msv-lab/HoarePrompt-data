Example Answer:
The code appends the sublist `[i, i]` to the `i-1`th sublist in the `ans` list. Since `ans` is a list of `n` empty lists, after execution, the `i-1`th sublist in `ans` will have the sublist `[i, i]` added to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of `n` lists where the `i-1`th list contains the sublist `[i, i]`**
