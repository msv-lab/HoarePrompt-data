According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a positive integer so it does not need adjustment. However, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 0. Additionally, the state of `m`, `edges`, and `ans` does not affect the loop execution based on the provided code snippet.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
