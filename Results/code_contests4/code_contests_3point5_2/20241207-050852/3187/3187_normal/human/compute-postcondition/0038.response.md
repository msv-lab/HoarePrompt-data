According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 1, `i` is increased by the total number of iterations, and all elements of `ans` have been printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` needs to be greater than the length of `ans` list by 2 and `i` needs to be increased by the total number of iterations plus 1.
State: **`n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 2, `i` is increased by the total number of iterations plus 1, `ans` is a list of lists, all elements of `ans` have been printed**
