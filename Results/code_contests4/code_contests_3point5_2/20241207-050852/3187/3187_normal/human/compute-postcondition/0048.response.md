The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns a value based on the constraints provided. The function calculates a value based on the formula min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), where n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and m is a non-negative integer between 0 and the result of the formula. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return a value based on the given constraints.
