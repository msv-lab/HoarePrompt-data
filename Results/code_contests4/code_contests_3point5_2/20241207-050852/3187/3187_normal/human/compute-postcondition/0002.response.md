Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list of edges and an empty list of lists named `ans` with `n` elements. The `edges` list is filled with `m` sublists using list comprehension. Since the initial state does not provide the values of the `rints()` function, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the `edges` list. The `ans` list is filled with empty lists. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of empty lists with `n` elements.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of empty lists with `n` elements**
