According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `ans[i]`, and `j`. If `i` is less than `n` and `ans[i]` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `ans[i]` is a list with at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]`. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, `ans[i]` needs to be a list with at least 2 elements, and `j` should be the second element in the list `ans[i]` and the elements of `j` should be printed separated by a space.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in the list `ans[i]` and the elements of `j` are printed separated by a space**
