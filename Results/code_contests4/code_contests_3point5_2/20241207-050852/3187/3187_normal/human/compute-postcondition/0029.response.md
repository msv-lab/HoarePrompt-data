According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to the length of `ans` list. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the length of `ans` list by 1, and `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 1, `i` is increased by 1**
