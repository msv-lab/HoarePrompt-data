Example Answer:
The lambda function `rints` is defined to take input from the standard input and convert it into a list of integers. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2)**.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2)**.
