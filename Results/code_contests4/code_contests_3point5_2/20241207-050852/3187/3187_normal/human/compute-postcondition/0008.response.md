Example Answer:
The code appends the sublist `[i, i]` to the sublist at index `i-1` in the `ans` list. Since `i` is increased by 1 in the initial state, the new sublist to be appended is `[i+1, i+1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is increased by 1, `m` is adjusted accordingly, `edges` is updated with necessary information for the new value of `n`, `ans` is updated with the sublist `[n+1, n+1]` at the end.
Output State: **`n` is increased by 1, `m` is adjusted accordingly, `edges` is updated with necessary information for the new value of `n`, `ans` is updated with the sublist `[n+1, n+1]` at the end**
