According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `edges`. If `edges` has at least one more sublist, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist. So for the loop to execute one more time, a new sublist must be appended to one of the lists in `ans`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist and a new sublist is appended to one of the lists in `ans` for the loop to execute again**
