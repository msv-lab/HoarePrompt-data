Example Answer:
The code appends a new sublist `[i + n + 1, j[0]]` to the `j[0] - 1`th sublist of `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `edges`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of `n` lists with new sublist appended to one of the lists.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of `n` lists with new sublist appended to one of the lists**
