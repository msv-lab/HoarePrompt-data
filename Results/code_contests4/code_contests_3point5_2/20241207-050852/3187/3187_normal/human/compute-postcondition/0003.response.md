According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to and including `n`. The loop will always execute as long as `n` is within the specified range. Before the loop starts, `m` and `edges` are not used in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted. The `ans` list should be modified to have `n` empty lists.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of `n` empty lists**
