According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `i-th` list of the `ans` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 2, `i` is increased by the total number of iterations plus 1, `ans` is a list of lists where `ans` has at least `i+1` elements and the `i-th` element of `ans` is a list. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be the next element in the `i-th` list of `ans`. This means that `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next list in `ans`, and `j` should be the first element of the new `i-th` list.

State: **`n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 2, `i` is increased by the total number of iterations plus 2, `ans` is a list of lists where `ans` has at least `i+2` elements and the `i+1-th` element of `ans` is a list, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is the first element in the `i+1-th` element of `ans` and the elements of `j` are printed.**
