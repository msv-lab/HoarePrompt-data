Example Answer:
The code snippet appends a new sublist to one of the lists in `ans`. The sublist contains two values: `i + n + 1` and `j[0]`. The value of `i` and `n` are not given in the initial state, so we can't calculate the exact values. However, it is clear that a new sublist is added to one of the lists in `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist, and a new sublist is appended to one of the lists in `ans`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists with at least one more sublist, and a new sublist is appended to one of the lists in `ans`**
