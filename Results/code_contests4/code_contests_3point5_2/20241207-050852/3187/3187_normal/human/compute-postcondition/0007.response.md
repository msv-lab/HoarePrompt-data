According to the code, the loop will execute for each `i` from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists, and `ans` is a list of `n + 1` lists with specific values. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` needs to be increased by 1, and the other states should be adjusted accordingly.
State: **`n` is increased by 1, `m` is adjusted accordingly, `edges` is updated with necessary information for the new value of `n`, `ans` is updated with the sublist `[n+1, n+1]` at the end**
