According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ans`. If `i` is less than the length of `ans` list and `ans[i]` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 1, `i` is increased by 1, and `ans` is a list of lists. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` should be increased by 1
- `i` must be less than the length of `ans` list
- `ans[i]` must not be empty

State: **`n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 1, `i` is increased by 2, `ans` is a list of lists, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `ans` list, and `ans[i]` must not be empty**
