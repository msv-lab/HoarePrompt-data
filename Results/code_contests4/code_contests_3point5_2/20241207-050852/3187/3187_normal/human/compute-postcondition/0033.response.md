According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `ans`, and the contents of `ans`. If `i` is less than the length of `ans` list, and the list `ans[i]` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is a list of lists, and `j` is the first element in the list `ans[i]` and the first element of `j` is printed. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `ans` list, and the list `ans[i]` must not be empty.

State: **`n` is greater than the length of `ans` list by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is a list of lists, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `ans` list, and `ans[i]` must not be empty**
