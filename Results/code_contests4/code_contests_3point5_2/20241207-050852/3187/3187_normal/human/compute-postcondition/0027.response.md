Example Answer:
The code prints the elements of list `j` separated by a space. The value of `j` is the second element of list `ans[i]`, which is guaranteed to have at least 2 elements. Therefore, the elements of `j` are printed separated by a space. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `ans[i]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in the list `ans[i]` and the elements of `j` are printed separated by a space**
