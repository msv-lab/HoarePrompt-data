According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists, and `ans` is a list of `n` lists where the `i-1`th list contains the sublist `[i, i]`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `n` should be incremented by 1
- `m` should be adjusted accordingly based on the new value of `n`
- `edges` should be updated with the necessary information for the new value of `n`
- `ans` should have a new list appended to represent the sublist for the new value of `n`

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 101, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), `edges` is a list of sublists with necessary information for the new value of `n`, `ans` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the `n`th list contains the sublist `[n+1, n+1]`**
