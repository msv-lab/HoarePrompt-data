Example Answer:
A new sublist is appended to the list at index `j[1] - 1` in the `ans` list. The new sublist contains two elements: `i + n + 1` and `j[1]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `edges` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of `n` lists with a new sublist appended to one of the lists.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `edges` is a list of sublists, `ans` is a list of `n` lists with a new sublist appended to one of the lists**
