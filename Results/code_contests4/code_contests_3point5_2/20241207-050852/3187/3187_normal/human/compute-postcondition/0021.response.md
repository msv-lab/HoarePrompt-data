Example Answer:
The code prints the length of the string stored in the list `ans` at index `i`. Since `i` is 0, it will print the length of the string at index 0 in the list `ans`. The value of `n` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
