Example Answer:
`ans[i - 1]` accesses the (i-1)th list in `ans` and appends the sublist `[i, i]` to it. Since initially `ans` contains `n + 1` lists where the `n`th list is `[n+1, n+1]`, after running the code, the `i`th list in `ans` will contain the sublist `[i, i]`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 101, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(1000, (n(n-1))/2), `edges` is a list of sublists with necessary information for the new value of `n`, `ans` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the `n`th list contains the sublist `[n+1, n+1]` and the `i`th list contains the sublist `[i, i]` after running the code.**
