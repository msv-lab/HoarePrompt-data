The function `func` reads in two positive integers `n` and `m` within specified ranges. It then creates a list `edges` based on input and modifies a list `ans` accordingly. Subsequently, it prints out the length of each sublist in `ans` along with their contents. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it operates based on user input.
