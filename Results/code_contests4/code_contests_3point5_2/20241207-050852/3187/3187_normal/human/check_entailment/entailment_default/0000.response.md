Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values of 'n' and 'm'.
- It then creates a list 'edges' based on the input pairs of colors that harmonize with each other.
- The code initializes a list 'ans' to store the rooks of each color.
- It then populates the 'ans' list with the initial position of the rook for each color.
- Next, for each pair of colors that harmonize, it adds rooks at the corresponding positions in 'ans'.
- Finally, it prints the number of rooks of each color and their positions as required.

The code follows the problem description for all cases and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
