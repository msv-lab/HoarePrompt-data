Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the `func_1` function which calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The calculation of `x` and `y` in the function is incorrect as it uses integer division which discards the fractional part. This leads to incorrect calculation of coordinates for Vanya's path and therefore incorrect counting of apple trees.

For example, if we take the input:
```
5 5 2 3
0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 1
```
The correct output should be `1 3` as per the problem description. However, the provided code may give a different output due to the incorrect calculations in the `func_1` function.

Therefore, the program is not correct and the Correctness is **False**.
