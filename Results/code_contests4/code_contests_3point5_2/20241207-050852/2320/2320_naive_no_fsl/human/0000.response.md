Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the field size, number of apple trees, and Vanya's movement vector.
2. It correctly calculates the coordinates of the cell from which Vanya should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible.
3. The program iterates through the apple tree coordinates, calculates the new coordinates based on the movement vector, and updates the count of apple trees seen from each cell.
4. Finally, it correctly identifies the cell with the maximum number of apple trees seen and prints the coordinates of that cell.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for the given inputs.
