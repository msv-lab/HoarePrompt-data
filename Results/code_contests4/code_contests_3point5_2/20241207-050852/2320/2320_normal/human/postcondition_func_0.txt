The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It performs calculations based on these inputs and recursive calls to itself. 

Case 1: If `b` is equal to 0, the function returns the tuple (a, 1, 0).

Case 2: For all other cases where `b` is not equal to 0, the function recursively calls itself with the parameters (b, a % b) and stores the result in variables g, tmp_x, and tmp_y. It then calculates and returns the values of g, x, and y based on these variables. Specifically, x is assigned the value of tmp_y, and y is calculated using the values of tmp_x, tmp_y, a, b, and the result of the recursive call to `func_1`.

Overall, the function `func_1` implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers and provides specific outputs based on the input values.
