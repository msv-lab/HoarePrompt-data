#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, dx, dy are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= m <= 10^5, 1 <= dx, dy <= n. The coordinates xi, yi of the apple trees are integers such that 0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1.**
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return a, 1, 0
        #The program returns variables a, 1, and 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n, m, dx, dy are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= m <= 10^5, 1 <= dx, dy <= n. The coordinates xi, yi of the apple trees are integers such that 0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1. The value of b is not equal to 0.
    g, tmp_x, tmp_y = func_1(b, a % b)
    x = tmp_y
    y = tmp_x - tmp_y * (a / b)
    return g, x, y
    #The program returns the values of variables g, x, and y after the calculations based on tmp_x, tmp_y, a, b, and the result of func_1. The value of x is assigned the value of tmp_y, and y is calculated based on the values of tmp_x, tmp_y, a, b, and func_1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It performs calculations based on these inputs and recursive calls to itself. 

Case 1: If `b` is equal to 0, the function returns the tuple (a, 1, 0).

Case 2: For all other cases where `b` is not equal to 0, the function recursively calls itself with the parameters (b, a % b) and stores the result in variables g, tmp_x, and tmp_y. It then calculates and returns the values of g, x, and y based on these variables. Specifically, x is assigned the value of tmp_y, and y is calculated using the values of tmp_x, tmp_y, a, b, and the result of the recursive call to `func_1`.

Overall, the function `func_1` implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers and provides specific outputs based on the input values.
