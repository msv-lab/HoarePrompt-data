Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is defined after being called in the main code block which results in a NameError. This means that the code will not be able to execute successfully. Therefore, the code is incorrect and needs to be modified to define the function `func_1` before it is called.
