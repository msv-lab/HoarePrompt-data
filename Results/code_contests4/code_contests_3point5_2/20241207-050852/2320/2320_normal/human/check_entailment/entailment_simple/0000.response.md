Correctness: **False**

The provided program is a recursive function that calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described in the problem description.

The program should determine the starting cell from which Vanya should begin his path in order to see as many apple trees as possible. This involves calculating the path that Vanya would take based on the given vector (dx, dy) and checking which cell he would revisit first.

The program provided only calculates the gcd of two numbers and does not address the problem requirements. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
