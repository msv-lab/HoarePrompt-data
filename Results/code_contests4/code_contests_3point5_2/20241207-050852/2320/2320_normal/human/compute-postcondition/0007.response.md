The function `func_1` accepts parameters `a` and `b`. `a` and `b` are integers. The function has two cases of output:

Case 1: The program returns variables `a`, 1, and 0.

Case 2: The program returns the values of variables `g`, `x`, and `y` after performing calculations based on `tmp_x`, `tmp_y`, `a`, `b`, and the result of `func_1`. The value of `x` is assigned the value of `tmp_y`, and `y` is calculated based on the values of `tmp_x`, `tmp_y`, `a`, `b`, and the result of `func_1`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and based on these inputs and additional calculations, return different sets of variables in two separate cases.
