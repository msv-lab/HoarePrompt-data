Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly by parsing the integer `n`, the permutation `p`, and the binary matrix `a`.
2. It then iterates through the permutation and matrix to determine if swaps are allowed based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
3. The program swaps elements in the permutation if the conditions are met.
4. Finally, it prints the prettiest permutation as output.

The code seems to follow the problem description accurately and handles the swapping logic correctly based on the provided conditions.
