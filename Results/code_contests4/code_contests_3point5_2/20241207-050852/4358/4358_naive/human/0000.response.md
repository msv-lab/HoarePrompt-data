Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the swapping is done based on the matrix A. The program only checks for the condition `a[i][j] == 1 and a[j][i] == 1` before swapping elements, which is not sufficient to guarantee the validity of the swap operation. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3 2 1
010
100
001
```
In this case, the program will output `3 2 1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1 2 3`. 

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it incorrect.
