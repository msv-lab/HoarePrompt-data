Example Answer:
`p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[i]`. The values of `p[i]` and `p[j]` are unknown, so the state of `tmp` changes according to the value of `p[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j]`**
