Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', i is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', i is 0**
