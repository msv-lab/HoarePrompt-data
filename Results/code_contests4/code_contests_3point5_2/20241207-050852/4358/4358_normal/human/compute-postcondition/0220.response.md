Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is 4, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string and n is greater than 4. The value at index i in list p is greater than the value at index j in list p. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the value at index i in list p is greater than the value at index j in list p, and both a[i][j] and a[j][i] are equal to 1***
