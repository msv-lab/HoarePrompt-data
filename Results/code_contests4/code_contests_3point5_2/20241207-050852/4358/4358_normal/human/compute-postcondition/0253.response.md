Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is equal to `n`, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is a string with the value of `p[1]` followed by a space, for the loop to execute again `i` is less than `n+1`, `s` is updated by adding `p[i]` followed by a space**
