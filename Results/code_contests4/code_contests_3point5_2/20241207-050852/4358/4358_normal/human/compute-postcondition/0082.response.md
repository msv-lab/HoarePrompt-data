Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 0, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`***
