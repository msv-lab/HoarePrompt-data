Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is 3, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 3. In addition, the integer at index `i` of list `p` is greater than the integer at index `j` of list `p`***
