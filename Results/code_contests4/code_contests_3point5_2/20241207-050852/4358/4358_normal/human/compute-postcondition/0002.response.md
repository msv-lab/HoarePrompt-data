Example Answer:
The variable p is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. Since the input values are distinct integers between 1 and n, the values in list p will be distinct integers between 1 and n. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1'.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1'**
