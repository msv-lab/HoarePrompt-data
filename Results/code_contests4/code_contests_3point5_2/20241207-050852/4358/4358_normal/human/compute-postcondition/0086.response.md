Example Answer:
`tmp` was initially assigned the value of `p[j]`. Then, `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which means `p[j]` now holds the original value of `tmp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j] and `p[j]` is assigned the original value of `tmp`.
Output State: **`tmp` is assigned the value of `p[j] and `p[j]` is assigned the original value of `tmp`**
