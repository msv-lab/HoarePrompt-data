Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 4, `j` is 6, `a` is a list of lists, `s` is the last entered string. `tmp` is assigned the value of the element at index `i` in list `p`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.**
