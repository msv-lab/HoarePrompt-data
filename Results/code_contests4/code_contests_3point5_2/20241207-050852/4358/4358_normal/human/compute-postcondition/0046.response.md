Example Answer:
`b` appends the value 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is updated to j+1, `b` is a list containing 0 or 1 depending on the value of `s[0]`, `s` is the input string, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than len(s) and `b` appends 1 if `s[j]` is '1' or 0 if not.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is updated to j+1, `b` is a list containing 0 or 1 depending on the value of `s[0]`, `s` is the input string, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than len(s) and `b` appends 1 if `s[j]` is '1' or 0 if not**
