Example Answer:
The list `b` is appended to the list `a`. The contents of list `b` depend on the characters in the input string `s`. The length of `b` is equal to the length of `s`. After appending `b` to `a`, `a` will contain the values of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is equal to the length of string `s`, `b` is a list containing 1 if the character at the corresponding index in string `s` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `s` is the input string. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is equal to the length of string `s`, `b` is a list containing 1 if the character at the corresponding index in string `s` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `s` is the input string**
