Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is greater or equal to 2, `b` is a list containing 1. If `s[j]` is '1', the state remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not '1', an additional element 0 is added to list `b`.***
