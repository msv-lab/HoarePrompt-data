Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with swapped values at index 2 and 6, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of lists, `j` is 7, `a` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last entered string, `s` is the last entered string, `j` is less than n, `tmp` is the value at index 2 of list `p` for the loop to execute again, `j` is less than n, `p[j]` is updated with the value stored in `tmp` if `p[i] > p[j]`.**
