Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is 1, `b` is a list containing 0 or 1 depending on the value of `s[0]`, `s` is the input string, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than len(s), and `b` appends 1 if `s[j]` is '1'. If `s[j]` is not '1', then the output state is the same as the initial state with `b` containing 0 instead of 1.***
