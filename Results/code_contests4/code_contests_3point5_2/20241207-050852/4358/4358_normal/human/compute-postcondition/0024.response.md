Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is greater or equal to 2, `b` is a list containing [1, 1] or [1, 0], `j` is 2. Depending on the condition, the state of the program will be updated accordingly.***
