Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is equal to `n`, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string. The values in list `p` have been rearranged according to the conditions in the loop for all possible comparisons of elements in `p`.
