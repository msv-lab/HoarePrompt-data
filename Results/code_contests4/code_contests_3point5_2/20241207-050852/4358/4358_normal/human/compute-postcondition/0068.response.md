Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is 2, so after execution, `j` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected as per the condition provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 3, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is 3, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the condition, `s` is the entered string with a length greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 3, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is 3, `b` is a list containing either 1 or 0 based on the condition, `s` is the entered string with a length greater than 0.**
