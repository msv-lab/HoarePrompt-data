Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with the value at index `i` updated to the value at index `j`, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, and the element at index `i` of list `p` is greater than the element at index `j` of list `p` if `a[i][j] == 1` and `a[j][i] == 1`.***
