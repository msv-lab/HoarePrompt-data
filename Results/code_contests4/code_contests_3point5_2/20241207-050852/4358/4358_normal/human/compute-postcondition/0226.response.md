Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with the value at index 4 updated, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is 5, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, and `tmp` holds the value at index 3 in list `p`. If `p[i] > p[j]`, and `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then a specific action is performed. Otherwise, no operation is executed.**
