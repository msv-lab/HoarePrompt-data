Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with updated values where `p[i]` is equal to `p[j`, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is 5, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is greater than 3, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, `tmp` holds the value at index 2 of list `p`, if `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]`, then update `p` accordingly, `tmp` is assigned the value at index 2 of list `p`. `p[j]` is updated with the value of `tmp`.
