Example Answer:
`p[i]` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, the value at index 2 of list `p` is replaced by the value at index 3 of list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with updated values, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is 3, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 3, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, `tmp` holds the value at index 2 of list `p`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with updated values, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is 3, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 3, `a[i][j]` and `a[j][i]` are both equal to 1, `tmp` holds the value at index 2 of list `p`**.
