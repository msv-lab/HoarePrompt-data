Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n`, a list of integers `p`, and a 2D list `A`. It then sorts the list `p` in non-decreasing order based on certain conditions. Finally, it concatenates the sorted `p` values into a string separated by spaces and prints the result. The function operates on global variables and does not explicitly return any value.**
