Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the input string, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than the length of `s`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is '1'***
