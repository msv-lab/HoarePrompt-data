Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in list `p` is updated to `tmp`. As `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, this update might disrupt the order. However, since `tmp` is replacing the value at index 5, the list remains sorted. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with the value at index 5 updated to the value at index `j`.
Output State: **`p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with the value at index 5 updated to the value at index `j`**
