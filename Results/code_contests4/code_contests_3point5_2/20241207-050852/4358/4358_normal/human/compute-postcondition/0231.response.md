Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with the value at index 5 updated, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of lists where each inner list corresponds to the input strings, `j` is 5, `b` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string, and `tmp` holds the value at index 5 in list `p`. If `a[i][j]` is equal to 1 and `a[j][i]` is equal to 1, then the program remains in the same state with the mentioned values.***
