Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the value at index `i` of list `p`. Since `i` is 2 and `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `tmp` will hold the value at index 2 of list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with swapped values at index `i` and `j`, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of lists, `j` is 5, `a` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last input string, `s` is the last entered string and for the loop to execute again `j` is less than n, `tmp` is the value at index 2 of list `p`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with swapped values at index `i` and `j`, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of lists, `j` is 5, `a` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last entered string, `s` is the last entered string and for the loop to execute again `j` is less than n, `tmp` is the value at index 2 of list `p**.
