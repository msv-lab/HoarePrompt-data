Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 5. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 6. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 4, `j` is 6, `a` is a list of lists, `s` is the last entered string. If `p[i]` is greater than `p[j]` and a[i][j] is equal to 1 and a[j][i] is equal to 1, then the program maintains the initial state without any changes.**
