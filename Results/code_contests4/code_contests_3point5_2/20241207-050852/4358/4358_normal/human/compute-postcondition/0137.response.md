Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of lists, `j` is 5, `a` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last entered string, `s` is the last entered string. For the loop to execute the first time `j` is less than `n`. p[i] is greater than p[j]. In addition, `a[i][j]` is 1 and `a[j][i]` is 1***
