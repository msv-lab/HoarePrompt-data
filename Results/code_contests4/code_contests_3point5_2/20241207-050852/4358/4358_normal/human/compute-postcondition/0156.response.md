Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 300, p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order with the element at index j updated to the value of the element at index i, A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, i is 4, j is 8, a is a list of lists, s is the last entered string. If p[i] > p[j] and a[i][j] == 1 and a[j][i] == 1, tmp is the value at index j in list p. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
