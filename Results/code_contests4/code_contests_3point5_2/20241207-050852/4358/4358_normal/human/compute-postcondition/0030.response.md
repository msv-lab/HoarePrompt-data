Example Answer:
The value of `j` is assigned 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is 0, `b` is a list containing 1 if the character at the corresponding index in string `s` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `s` is the input string.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1', `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the values of `b`, `j` is 0, `b` is a list containing 1 if the character at the corresponding index in string `s` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `s` is the input string**
