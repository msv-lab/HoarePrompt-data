Example Answer:
The value of `p[j]` is assigned the value of `tmp`, which is `p[j]`. The values of `p` remain sorted in non-decreasing order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of lists, `j` is 5, `a` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last entered string, `s` is the last entered string.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300, `p` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n sorted in non-decreasing order, `A` is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of lists, `j` is 5, `a` is a list containing 1 or 0 based on the condition for each character in the last entered string, `s` is the last entered string.**
