**Precondition**: 
- n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300.
- p is a permutation of size n, represented as a list of integers where each integer between 1 and n occurs exactly once.
- A is a binary matrix of size n x n, represented as a list of strings where each string consists of '0' or '1'. 
- For all integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, Ai, j = Aj, i holds.
- For all integers i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Ai, i = 0 holds.
