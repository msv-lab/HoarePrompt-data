**Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 300. The permutation p is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n. The matrix A is a 2D list of characters with dimensions n x n where each character is either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that for all integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, Ai, j = Aj, i holds and for all integers i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Ai, i = 0 holds.**
