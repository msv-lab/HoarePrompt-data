You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: User ainta has a permutation p1, p2, ..., pn. As the New Year is coming, he wants to make his permutation as pretty as possible.

Permutation a1, a2, ..., an is prettier than permutation b1, b2, ..., bn, if and only if there exists an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) where a1 = b1, a2 = b2, ..., ak - 1 = bk - 1 and ak < bk all holds.

As known, permutation p is so sensitive that it could be only modified by swapping two distinct elements. But swapping two elements is harder than you think. Given an n × n binary matrix A, user ainta can swap the values of pi and pj (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j) if and only if Ai, j = 1.

Given the permutation p and the matrix A, user ainta wants to know the prettiest permutation that he can obtain.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the size of the permutation p.

The second line contains n space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pn — the permutation p that user ainta has. Each integer between 1 and n occurs exactly once in the given permutation.

Next n lines describe the matrix A. The i-th line contains n characters '0' or '1' and describes the i-th row of A. The j-th character of the i-th line Ai, j is the element on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of A. It is guaranteed that, for all integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, Ai, j = Aj, i holds. Also, for all integers i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Ai, i = 0 holds.

Output

In the first and only line, print n space-separated integers, describing the prettiest permutation that can be obtained.

Examples

Input

7
5 2 4 3 6 7 1
0001001
0000000
0000010
1000001
0000000
0010000
1001000


Output

1 2 4 3 6 7 5


Input

5
4 2 1 5 3
00100
00011
10010
01101
01010


Output

1 2 3 4 5

Note

In the first sample, the swap needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is: (p1, p7).

In the second sample, the swaps needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is (p1, p3), (p4, p5), (p3, p4). 

<image>

A permutation p is a sequence of integers p1, p2, ..., pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. The i-th element of the permutation p is denoted as pi. The size of the permutation p is denoted as n.
