Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The problem states that a swap between elements can only occur if the corresponding value in the matrix A is 1, indicating the feasibility of the swap. However, the code does not check this condition before swapping elements. This means that the code does not adhere to the problem's requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is false.
