Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, sorts the permutation `p` in non-decreasing order based on specific conditions, and then prints the prettiest permutation that can be obtained. The swapping of elements in the permutation is done based on the values in the matrix `A` as described in the problem.

The program maintains the necessary state information throughout the execution, and the final output is the prettiest permutation that satisfies the given conditions.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
