Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is expected to output the prettiest permutation that can be obtained based on the given permutation `p` and the binary matrix `A`. However, the program simply sorts the elements of the permutation `p` in non-decreasing order without taking into account the conditions specified in the problem description.

To correct the program, it needs to be modified to follow the steps outlined in the problem description in order to obtain the prettiest permutation. The program should swap elements in the permutation `p` based on the conditions specified in the binary matrix `A`.
