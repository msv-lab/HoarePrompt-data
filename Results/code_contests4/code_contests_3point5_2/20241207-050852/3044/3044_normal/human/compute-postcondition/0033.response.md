Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list containing final elements, `i` is a non-negative integer (increased by 1), and `s` is a string split at space index 1 if not equal to 'pwd' and input value is greater than current `i`. If `s[0] == '/'`, then `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `s` is an empty list.***
