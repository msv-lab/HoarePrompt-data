Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the value of the input received from the user. The type of input is not specified, but it is expected to be a string. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input must be a non-negative integer, `s` is the input string.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input must be a non-negative integer, `s` is the input string**
