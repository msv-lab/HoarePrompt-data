According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If the string is split at '/' and there is at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the input must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute the first time, and `s` is the input string split at the space index 1. Additionally, the input string `s` must not be equal to 'pwd', and if `s[0]` is equal to '/', then `s[0]` should be equal to the character at index 2 to the end of the original string.

State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the input must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is the input string split at the space index 1, `s` is not equal to 'pwd', if `s[0]` is equal to '/', then `s[0]` is equal to the character at index 2 to the end of the original string**.
