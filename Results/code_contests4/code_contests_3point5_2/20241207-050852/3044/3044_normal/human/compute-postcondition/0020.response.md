Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list. If `x` is equal to '..', `cur` is a list with the last element removed. If `x` is not equal to '..', `cur` is a list that contains the value of `x`. In both cases, `s` is a string split at space index 1, `s` is not equal to 'pwd', and the next value of `x` in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/' is considered for the next loop iteration.***
