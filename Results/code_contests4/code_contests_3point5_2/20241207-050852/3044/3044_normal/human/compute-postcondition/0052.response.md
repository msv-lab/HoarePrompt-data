Example Answer:
The code prints a concatenated string where each element of the list `cur` is joined by a '/' separator. The elements of the list `cur` are displayed with '/' in between them. The values of `cur`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's', `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is a list split at '/' excluding 'pwd'.
Output State: **`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's', `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is a list split at '/' excluding 'pwd'**
