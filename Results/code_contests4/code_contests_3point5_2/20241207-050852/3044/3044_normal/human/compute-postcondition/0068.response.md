Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed using list slicing. The values of `x` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the third element.
Output State: **`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the third element**
