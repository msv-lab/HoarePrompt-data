Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed by slicing the list with `[:-1]`. The content of `s` is not affected as it contains the original values separated by '/'. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list with the last element removed, `s` contains at least two values separated by '/'.
Output State: **`cur` is a list with the last element removed, `s` contains at least two values separated by '/'**
