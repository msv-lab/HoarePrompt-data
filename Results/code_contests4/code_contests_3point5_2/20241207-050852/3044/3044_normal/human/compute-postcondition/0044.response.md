According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and the condition that `x` is not equal to 'pwd'. If these conditions are met, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is a list, `i` is 2, `s` is a list that is split at '/', the result is not equal to 'pwd', and the input value is greater than 2. If `x` is equal to '..', then `cur` is a list without the last element. If `x` is not equal to '..', then `cur` is a list containing the value of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `x` should be considered. If the next value of `x` is equal to '..', then `cur` should be adjusted to remove the last element. If the next value of `x` is not equal to '..', then `cur` should be adjusted to include the value of `x`.

State: **`cur` is a list, `i` is 3, `s` is a list that is split at '/', the result is not equal to 'pwd', and the input value is greater than 2. If the next value of `x` is equal to '..', then `cur` is a list without the last element. If the next value of `x` is not equal to '..', then `cur` is a list containing the value of the next `x`.**
