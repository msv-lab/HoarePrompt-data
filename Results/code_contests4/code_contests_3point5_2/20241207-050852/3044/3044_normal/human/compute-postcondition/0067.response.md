According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements to split in the string `s`. If `x` is not equal to '..', the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have more elements to split and `x` must not be equal to '..'.
State: **`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the third element.**
