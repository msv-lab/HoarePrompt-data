Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's', `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element. If `s[0]` is '/', then `cur` is an empty list, and `i` is the incremented total number of iterations. Otherwise, there is no change in `cur`, `i`, and `s` after the execution of the if else block, for the loop to execute the first time `s` contains at least one element. The value of `x` is not '..'***
