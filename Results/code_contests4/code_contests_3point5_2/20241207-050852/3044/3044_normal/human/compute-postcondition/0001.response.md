According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user. If the input is a non-negative integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `cur` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `cur` is an empty list and `i` is 0.
State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input must be a non-negative integer**
