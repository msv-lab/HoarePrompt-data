Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is 3, and `s` is a list that is split at '/'. If `x` is equal to '..', then `cur` is a list without the last element. If `x` is not equal to '..', then `cur` is a list containing the value of the next `x`. The result is not equal to 'pwd', and the input value is greater than 2.***
