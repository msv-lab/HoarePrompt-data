Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is an non-negative integer, `s` is a string split at space index 1, `s` is not equal to 'pwd'. If `s[0]` is '/', then `s[0]` is equal to the character at index 2 to the end of the original string. If `x` is equal to '..', `cur` contains the value of `x`. Otherwise, `cur` does not contain the value of `x`.***
