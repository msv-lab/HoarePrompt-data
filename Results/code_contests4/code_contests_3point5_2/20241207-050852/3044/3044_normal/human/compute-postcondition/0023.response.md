Example Answer:
`x` is added to the end of the list `cur`. The content of `s` is split by '/' to generate the next value of `x`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `cur` is a list with `x` added to the end, `s` contains at least two values separated by '/, the next value of `x` in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/' will be considered for the next loop iteration.
Output State: **`cur` is a list with `x` added to the end, `s` contains at least two values separated by '/, the next value of `x` in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/' will be considered for the next loop iteration**
