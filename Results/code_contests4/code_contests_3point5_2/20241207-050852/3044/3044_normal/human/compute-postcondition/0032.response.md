Example Answer:
The code removes the first element of list `s` using slicing. Since `s` is split at space index 1 if not equal to 'pwd', and the input value is greater than the current `i`, and initially `s` is an empty list, after executing `s = s[1:]`, `s` remains an empty list. The values of `i` and `cur` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is an empty list.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is an empty list**
