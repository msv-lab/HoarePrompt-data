Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `i` is 2, `s` is a list that is split at '/', the result is not equal to 'pwd', and the input value is greater than 2. If `x` is equal to '..' then `cur` is a list without the last element. If `x` is not equal to '..', then `cur` is a list containing the value of `x`.***
