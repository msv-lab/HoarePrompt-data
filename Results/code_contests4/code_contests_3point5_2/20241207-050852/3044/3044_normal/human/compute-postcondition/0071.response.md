Output State: **`cur` is a list containing the final elements after processing 's' based on the values of `x`, `i` is the total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the last element. If `x` is '..', then `cur` will remove the last element in each iteration, `i` is the total number of iterations. If `s[0]` is '/', then `cur` will be an empty list, and `i` is the total number of iterations. Otherwise, `cur` will contain the final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the total number of iterations.**
