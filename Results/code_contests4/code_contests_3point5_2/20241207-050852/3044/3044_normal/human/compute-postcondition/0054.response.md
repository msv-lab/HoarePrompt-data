Example Answer:
The list `cur` is reinitialized as an empty list. The values of `i` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is the second element of the split list.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is the second element of the split list**
