Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a positive integer `n` representing the number of commands. Each command parameter is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters, slashes, and dots, with a length between 1 and 200 characters inclusive. The function then iterates through the commands where if the command is 'pwd', it prints the current path. If the command is not 'pwd', it manipulates the current path based on the command. The function updates the `cur` list to reflect the current path structure after processing all commands.**
