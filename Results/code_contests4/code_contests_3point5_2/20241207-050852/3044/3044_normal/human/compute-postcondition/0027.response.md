According to the code, the loop execution depends on the range of the input value. For the loop to execute one more time, the input value needs to be greater than the current value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- If `s` is equal to 'pwd', `cur` remains empty and `i` remains the same.
- If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', `cur` contains processed elements, `i` is a non-negative integer, and `s` is split at space index 1. If `s[0]` is '/', then `s[0]` is equal to the character at index 2 to the end of the original string.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`cur` is a list containing final elements, `i` is a non-negative integer (increased by 1), and `s` is a string split at space index 1 if not equal to 'pwd' and input value is greater than current `i`**
