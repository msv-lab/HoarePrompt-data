Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the third element.
Output State: **`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the third element**
