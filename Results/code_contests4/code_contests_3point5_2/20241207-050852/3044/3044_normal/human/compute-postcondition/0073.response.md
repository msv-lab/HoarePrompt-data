Output State: **`cur` is a list containing the final elements after processing all the input values, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `s` is a string. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', `cur` remains an empty list and `i` remains 0. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', then `cur` contains the processed elements after each iteration, `i` is a non-negative integer representing the total number of iterations, and `s` is split at space index 1. If `s[0]` is '/', then `cur` will be an empty list and `s[0]` will be equal to the character at index 2 to the end of the original string.**
