According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `s`. If the next value of `x` in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/' is considered for the next loop iteration, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is a list, `x` is the last element in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/', `s` is split at space index 1 and is not equal to 'pwd'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `x` in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/' needs to be considered. This implies that `s` must contain at least two values separated by '/'. 

State: **`cur` is a list, `s` contains at least two values separated by '/', the next value of `x` in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/' will be considered for the next loop iteration**
