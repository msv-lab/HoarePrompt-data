Example Answer:
The code snippet `s = s.split()[1]` splits the list `s` at spaces and takes the second element (index 1). The variable `s` initially contained a list split at '/', excluding 'pwd'. After executing the code, `s` will now only have the second element of the split list. The variables `cur` and `i` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's', `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is the second element of the split list**
