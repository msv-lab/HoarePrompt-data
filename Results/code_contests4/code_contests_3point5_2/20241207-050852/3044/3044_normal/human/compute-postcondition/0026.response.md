Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list containing the final elements after processing all the values in `s`, `i` is a non-negative integer, and `s` is a string. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', `cur` remains an empty list and `i` remains 0. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', then `cur` contains the processed elements, `i` is a non-negative integer, and `s` is split at space index 1. If `s[0]` is '/', then `s[0]` is equal to the character at index 2 to the end of the original string.***
