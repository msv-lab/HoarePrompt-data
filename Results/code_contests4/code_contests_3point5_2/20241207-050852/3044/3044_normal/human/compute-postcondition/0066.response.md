Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element. If `x` is equal to '..', the state remains the same. Otherwise, `cur` contains final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, and `i` is the incremented total number of iterations.***
