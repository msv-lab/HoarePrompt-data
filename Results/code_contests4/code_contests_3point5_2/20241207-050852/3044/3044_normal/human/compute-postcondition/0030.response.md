Example Answer:
`s` is split at space index 1, and the resulting value is assigned back to `s`. If the split value is not equal to 'pwd' and the input value is greater than the current value of `i`, then `s` will be updated accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list containing final elements, `i` is a non-negative integer (increased by 1), and `s` is a string split at space index 1 if not equal to 'pwd' and input value is greater than current `i`.
Output State: **`cur` is a list containing final elements, `i` is a non-negative integer (increased by 1), and `s` is a string split at space index 1 if not equal to 'pwd' and input value is greater than current `i`**
