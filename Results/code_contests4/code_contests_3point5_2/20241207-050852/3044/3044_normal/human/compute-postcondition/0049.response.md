Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list containing final elements, `i` is a non-negative integer (increased by 1), and `s` is a string split at space index 1 if not equal to 'pwd' and input value is greater than current `i`. If s == 'pwd', then no changes are made to `cur`, `i`, and `s`. If s is not equal to 'pwd', then `cur` is a list containing the elements after processing all the 'x' values in 's', `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `s` is a list that is split at '/' and does not contain 'pwd'. If 'x' is equal to '..', then the last element is removed from 'cur'. If 'x' is not equal to '..', then 'x' is appended to 'cur'.***
