Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed using list slicing, so the value of `cur` changes. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a list without the last element, `i` is 2, `s` is a list that is split at '/', the result is not equal to 'pwd', and the input value is greater than 2. `x` is not equal to '..'.
Output State: **`cur` is a list without the last element, `i` is 2, `s` is a list that is split at '/', the result is not equal to 'pwd', and the input value is greater than 2. `x` is not equal to '..'**
