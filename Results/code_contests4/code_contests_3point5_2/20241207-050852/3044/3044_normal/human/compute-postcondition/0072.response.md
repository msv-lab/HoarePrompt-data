Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's', `i` is the total number of iterations, `s` is a list split at '/' excluding 'pwd'. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', then the function does nothing. Otherwise, based on the values of `x`, `cur` will contain the final elements after processing 's'. If `x` is '..', then the last element will be removed in each iteration. If `s[0]` is '/', then `cur` will be an empty list. Otherwise, `cur` will contain the final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, and `i` is the total number of iterations.***
