Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list, `s` contains at least two values separated by '/'. If x == '..', `cur` is a list with the last element removed. Otherwise, `cur` is a list with `x` added to the end. In both cases, the next value of `x` in the list generated by splitting `s` at '/' will be considered for the next loop iteration.***
