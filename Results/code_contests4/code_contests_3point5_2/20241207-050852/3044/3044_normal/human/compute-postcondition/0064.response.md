Example Answer:
The last element of the list `cur` is removed by slicing the list from the beginning up to the last element. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list or contains final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list or contains final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element**
