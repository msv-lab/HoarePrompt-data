Example Answer: 
The list `s` is modified to remove its first element, so `s` becomes all elements starting from the second element. The values of `cur` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is an empty list, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element**
