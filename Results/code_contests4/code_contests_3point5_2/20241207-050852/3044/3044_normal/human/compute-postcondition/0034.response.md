According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s` and its value after splitting at '/'. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd' and the input value is greater than the current `i`, the loop can execute. Additionally, if `s[0] == '/'`, the loop can execute with the initial state of `cur` being an empty list, `i` as 1, and `s` as an empty list.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `s` is an empty list if `s[0] == '/'`, for the loop to execute `s` is split at '/' and meets the condition where it is not equal to 'pwd' and the input value is greater than current `i`.**
