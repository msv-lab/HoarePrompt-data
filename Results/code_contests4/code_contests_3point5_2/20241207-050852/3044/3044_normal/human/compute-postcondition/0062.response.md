Postcondition: ***`cur` is a list containing final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element. If `x` is '..', then `cur` becomes an empty list by removing the last element, `i` is still the incremented total number of iterations. If `s[0]` is '/', then `cur` is an empty list, and `i` is the incremented total number of iterations. Otherwise, there is no change in `cur`, `i`, and `s` after the execution of the if else block. The loop will execute for the first time when `s` contains at least one element.***
