Example Answer:
The code prints the elements of the list `cur` joined by '/' with a '/' added at the beginning. Since `cur` is an empty list, the output will be just '/'. The variables `i` and `s` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`cur` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is the input string 'pwd'**
