Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `cur`. The list `cur` now contains the final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`. The total number of iterations `i` is incremented. The loop can execute again if `s` contains at least one element. Therefore, the output state is: `cur` contains final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element.
Output State: **`cur` contains final elements after processing 's' and the appended value of `x`, `i` is the incremented total number of iterations, `s` is all elements starting from the second element**
