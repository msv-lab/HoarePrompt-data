You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya is writing an operating system shell, and it should have commands for working with directories. To begin with, he decided to go with just two commands: cd (change the current directory) and pwd (display the current directory).

Directories in Vasya's operating system form a traditional hierarchical tree structure. There is a single root directory, denoted by the slash character "/". Every other directory has a name — a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Each directory (except for the root) has a parent directory — the one that contains the given directory. It is denoted as "..".

The command cd takes a single parameter, which is a path in the file system. The command changes the current directory to the directory specified by the path. The path consists of the names of directories separated by slashes. The name of the directory can be "..", which means a step up to the parent directory. «..» can be used in any place of the path, maybe several times. If the path begins with a slash, it is considered to be an absolute path, that is, the directory changes to the specified one, starting from the root. If the parameter begins with a directory name (or ".."), it is considered to be a relative path, that is, the directory changes to the specified directory, starting from the current one.

The command pwd should display the absolute path to the current directory. This path must not contain "..".

Initially, the current directory is the root. All directories mentioned explicitly or passed indirectly within any command cd are considered to exist. It is guaranteed that there is no attempt of transition to the parent directory of the root directory.

Input

The first line of the input data contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of commands.

Then follow n lines, each contains one command. Each of these lines contains either command pwd, or command cd, followed by a space-separated non-empty parameter.

The command parameter cd only contains lower case Latin letters, slashes and dots, two slashes cannot go consecutively, dots occur only as the name of a parent pseudo-directory. The command parameter cd does not end with a slash, except when it is the only symbol that points to the root directory. The command parameter has a length from 1 to 200 characters, inclusive.

Directories in the file system can have the same names.

Output

For each command pwd you should print the full absolute path of the given directory, ending with a slash. It should start with a slash and contain the list of slash-separated directories in the order of being nested from the root to the current folder. It should contain no dots.

Examples

Input

7
pwd
cd /home/vasya
pwd
cd ..
pwd
cd vasya/../petya
pwd


Output

/
/home/vasya/
/home/
/home/petya/


Input

4
cd /a/b
pwd
cd ../a/b
pwd


Output

/a/b/
/a/a/b/
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of commands. Each command parameter is a non-empty string containing only lowercase Latin letters, slashes, and dots. The length of each command parameter is between 1 and 200 characters inclusive.**
def func():
    cur = []
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = raw_input()
        
        if s == 'pwd':
            print('/' + '/'.join(cur))
        else:
            s = s.split()[1]
            if s[0] == '/':
                cur = []
                s = s[1:]
            for x in s.split('/'):
                if x == '..':
                    cur = cur[:-1]
                else:
                    cur.append(x)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `cur` is a list containing the final elements after processing all the input values, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `s` is a string. If `s` is equal to 'pwd', `cur` remains an empty list and `i` remains 0. If `s` is not equal to 'pwd', then `cur` contains the processed elements after each iteration, `i` is a non-negative integer representing the total number of iterations, and `s` is split at space index 1. If `s[0]` is '/', then `cur` will be an empty list and `s[0]` will be equal to the character at index 2 to the end of the original string.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
