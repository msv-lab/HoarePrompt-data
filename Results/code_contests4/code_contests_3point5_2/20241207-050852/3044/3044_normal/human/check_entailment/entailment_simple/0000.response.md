Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It maintains a list `cur` to keep track of the current directory structure. It correctly handles the `pwd` command by printing the absolute path of the current directory. It also correctly handles the `cd` command by updating the `cur` list based on the provided path. The program ensures that the path does not contain ".." when printing the absolute path.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all cases.
