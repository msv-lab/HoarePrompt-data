Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It processes the commands to change the current directory and display the absolute path to the current directory. The logic in the program handles both absolute and relative paths correctly, including the use of ".." to move up to the parent directory. The program maintains the correct state of the current directory throughout the iterations, ensuring that the output paths are accurate.
