Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It maintains a list `cur` to keep track of the current directory path. When the `pwd` command is given, it correctly prints the absolute path to the current directory. When the `cd` command is given, it correctly updates the current directory path based on the provided parameter. It handles both absolute and relative paths, as well as the ".." directory correctly. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is True.
