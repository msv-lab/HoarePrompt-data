Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues:
1. The data structures are initialized incorrectly. Instead of `list({})`, it should be `[]` for lists and `dict({})` for dictionaries.
2. The logic for processing the queries is flawed. The `query` list is being used incorrectly to store the queries.
3. The function `func_1` is not implemented correctly and does not seem to address the requirements of the problem description.
4. The output calculation for the number of distinct names among all names of the ki-sons is not correctly implemented.

These issues indicate that the program is not correct as it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
