Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[x]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then the value at index `j` in `ans[x]` is updated with the bitwise OR of the values at index `j` in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`, and the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is cleared. Otherwise, the `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]` is copied to the `j`-th element of `ans[x]`.***
