According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is not given any specific value. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `x` must be assigned a value other than -1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be assigned a value other than -1**
