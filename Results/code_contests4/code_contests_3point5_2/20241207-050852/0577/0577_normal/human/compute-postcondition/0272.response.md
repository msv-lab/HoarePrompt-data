Postcondition: ***`j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `fa[x]` are all updated based on the conditions. The length of `ans[x]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, for the loop to execute `ans[fa[x]]` is not empty. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[x][j]` is less than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`***
