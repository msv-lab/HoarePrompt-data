Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[x]` after processing in the loop body. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then the values remain unchanged. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is cleared***.
