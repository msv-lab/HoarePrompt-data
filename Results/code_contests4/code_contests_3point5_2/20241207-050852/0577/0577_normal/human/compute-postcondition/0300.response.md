Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `fa[x]`, `dep`, `Child`, `j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]]` are all variables. If x is not equal to 0, after the execution of the if-else block, `j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `fa[x]`, `ans[fa[x]]` will be updated based on the specified conditions. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]]`, `answer[j]`, and `ans[x]` will be empty. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]]` will be assigned the value of `ans[x]`, and `answer[j]` will be determined by whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x] or not, with `answer[j]` being assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]` if the condition is satisfied.***
