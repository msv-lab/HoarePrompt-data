According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `nowlistindex` and `query[x]`. If `nowlistindex` is less than the length of `query[x]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nowlistindex` needs to be less than the length of `query[x]`.
State: **`j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 3]`, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 4, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 2]` for the loop to execute again `nowlistindex` must be less than the length of `query[x]`**
