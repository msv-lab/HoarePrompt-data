Example Answer:
The `clear()` method is called on the string at position `j` in the list at index `x`. This method clears the contents of the string. The list `ans` is a list of strings with updated values based on the bitwise OR operation, and after this operation, the string at position `j` in the list at index `x` is cleared. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is a list of strings with updated values based on the bitwise OR operation where the string at position `j` in the list at index `x` is cleared.
Output State: **`ans` is a list of strings with updated values based on the bitwise OR operation where the string at position `j` in the list at index `x` is cleared**
