Example Answer:
`j` is updated to the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `nowlistindex` is still incremented by 4, and `i` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. The length of `ans[x][dep + i]` is calculated and assigned to `answer[j]`. 
Output State: **`j` is updated to a new value, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 4, `i` retains its value, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`**
