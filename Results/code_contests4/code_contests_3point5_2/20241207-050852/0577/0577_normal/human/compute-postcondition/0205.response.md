Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `fa[x]`, `dep`, `Child` are all variables. If `nowChild[x] == lenChild[x]`, then the value of `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1 and `x` is updated to `fa[x] while `dep` is decreased by 1. If `nowChild[x] != lenChild[x]`, then `x` is assigned a value from `Child[x]` based on the index `nowChild[x]`, and `dep` is increased by 1.***
