Output State: **`Output State: ans[x][dep + i] is a set containing ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the second to last element of `query[x`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0, If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i`, `len(ans[x])` is not less than `len(ans[fa[x]]) for the loop to execute. After the execution of the if else block, if `j` is not in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]]` has a length less than or equal to `ans[x]`. `ans[x][j]` is updated with the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` without the previous elements from `ans[fa[x]][j]` being included if `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, otherwise `ans[x][j]` contains the values of `ans[fa[x]][j`.**
