Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The value of `nowlistindex` is 4, so `nowlistindex + 1` is 5. Therefore, `j` is updated to `query[x][5]`. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is updated to `query[x][5]`**
