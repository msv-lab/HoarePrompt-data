Postcondition: ***Output State: `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` for the loop to execute one more time. In the if part, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by performing a bitwise OR operation with `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. In the else part, `ans[x][j]` is updated to include the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated to include the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
