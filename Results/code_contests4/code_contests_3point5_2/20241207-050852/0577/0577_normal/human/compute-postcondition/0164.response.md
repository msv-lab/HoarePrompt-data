Postcondition: ***Output State: ans[x][dep] is a set containing ss[x], query[x] has at least 1 element, nowlistindex is the index of the last element in query[x] or the last index before it goes out of bounds, i is the last element of query[x], j is the second to last element of query[x], If dep + i is not in ans[x], then answer[j] is set to 0, If dep + i is in ans[x], then answer[j] is assigned the length of ans[x][dep + i], len(ans[x]) is not less than len(ans[fa[x]]) for the loop to execute. Additionally, if j is not in ans[x], then the state of the program satisfies the condition where j is not in ans[x].***
