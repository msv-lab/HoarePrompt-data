Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j] |= ans[x][j]` performs a bitwise OR operation between the characters at index `j` of the strings at indexes `fa[x]` and `x` in the list `ans`. The string at index `fa[x]` should be longer than the string at index `x` for the loop to execute one more time. 
Output State: **No specific output state is provided as it depends on the actual values stored in the list `ans` and the indices `x` and `fa[x]`.**
