Example Answer:
The code `ans[x].clear()` clears the string at index `x` in the `ans` list. The initial state does not provide information about the contents of the `ans` list or the value of `x`, so the output state will be that the string at index `x` in the `ans` list is cleared.
Output State: **The string at index `x` in the `ans` list is cleared**
