Example Answer:
The value of `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The previous values of `ans`, `fa`, `x`, and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is a list of strings with updated values after the bitwise OR operation where the string at index `j` of the list at index `fa[x]` is cleared.
Output State: **`ans` is a list of strings with updated values after the bitwise OR operation where the string at index `j` of the list at index `fa[x]` is cleared**
