Postcondition: ***`nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `fa[x]`, `dep`, `Child` are all variables. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x] and `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1; `dep` is decreased by 1. If `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `fa[x]`, `dep` are all incremented by 1 and `x` is assigned the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`.***
