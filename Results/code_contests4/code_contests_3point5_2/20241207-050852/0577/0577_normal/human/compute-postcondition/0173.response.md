Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, where `fa[x]` is a parent node of `x`. Since `ans[x][j]` was initially an empty set, it will now contain the values that `ans[fa[x]][j]` had. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` contains the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` contains the values of `ans[fa[x]][j]**.
