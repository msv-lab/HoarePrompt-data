Example Answer:
The code clears the `j`-th element of the list at index `x` in `ans`. Since `j` is in `ans[x]`, the `j`-th element of the list at index `fa[x]` is updated. The length of `ans[x]` is still greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]` is updated.
Output State: **`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]` is updated**
