Postcondition: ***`j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]]` are all updated based on conditions. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. If `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
