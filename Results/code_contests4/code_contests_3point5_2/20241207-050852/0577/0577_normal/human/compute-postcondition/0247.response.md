Example Answer:
The `clear()` method is called on the list `ans[x][j]`, which removes all elements from the list. The list `ans[x][j]` is cleared, but the values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: variables are updated based on conditions for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **variables are updated based on conditions for the next iteration of the loop**
