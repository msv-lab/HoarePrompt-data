Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[x]`. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
