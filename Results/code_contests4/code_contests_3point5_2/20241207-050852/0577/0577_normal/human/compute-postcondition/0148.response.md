Example Answer: 
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The value of `ans[x][j]` is not specified, so it remains as `ss[x]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` for the loop to execute one more time, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the OR operation, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.
Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` for the loop to execute one more time, `ans[x][j]` is updated with the OR operation, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared**
