Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Given that the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the assignment is valid. After the assignment, `ans[x][j]` is cleared. The state of other variables remains the same.
Output State: **`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[x] after processing in the loop body, `ans[x][j]` is cleared.**
