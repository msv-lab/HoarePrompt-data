Example Answer: 
If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The value of `nowlistindex` needs to be incremented by 2 to possibly execute the loop one more time. The value of `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2 (within the range of `query[x]`), `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`.
Output State: **`j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2 (within the range of `query[x]`), `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`**
