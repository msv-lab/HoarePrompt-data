Postcondition: ***After the if-else block, `j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `fa[x]` are all updated based on the conditions. The length of `ans[x]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then the program continues with the updated values. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is compared to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the list `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, values of `j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `fa[x]` are updated based on conditions. `ans[x][j]` is cleared, and `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
