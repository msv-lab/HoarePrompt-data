According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. 
At the end of the last iteration, `x`, `nowChild[x]`, `fa[x]`, `dep`, `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `lenChild[x]` are all integer variables. 
If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `x` is updated to a new value based on `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged, and `dep` is incremented by 1. 
Otherwise, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, and `dep` is decreased by 1. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `x` should be updated to a new value based on `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, and `dep` should be incremented by 1.
- If `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, `nowChild[x]` should be increased by 1, `x` should be updated to the value of `fa[x]`, and `dep` should be decreased by 1.

State: **adjust the states based on the conditions mentioned above**
