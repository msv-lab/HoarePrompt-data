Output State: **`x` is assigned a value other than -1, `nowChild` and `lenChild` are equal at index `x`, `x` is not equal to 0, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x`, `query[x]` has a length of at least 2, `nowlistindex` is the last index in `query[x]`, `i` is assigned the value of the last element in `query[x]`, `j` is assigned the value of the second last element in `query[x]`. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.**
