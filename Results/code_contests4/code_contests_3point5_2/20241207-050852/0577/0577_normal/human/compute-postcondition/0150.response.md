Postcondition: ***Output State: `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]` for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` has been updated by taking the union of the sets `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]`, and `ans[x][j]` becomes an empty set. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is updated with the OR operation, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared.***
