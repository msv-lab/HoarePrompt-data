Example Answer:
The value of `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, which means `nowChild[x]` will be incremented by 1 based on the updated value of `x`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x] and `nowChild[x] is incremented by 1.
Output State: **The value of `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x] and `nowChild[x] is incremented by 1**
