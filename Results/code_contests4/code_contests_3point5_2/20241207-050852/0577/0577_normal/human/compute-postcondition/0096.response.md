Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `nowChild` and `lenChild` are equal at index `x`. If x is not equal to 0, the list `ans` contains strings. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the string at index `x` in `ans` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the string at index `fa[x]` is cleared and assigned the value of `ans[x]`.***
