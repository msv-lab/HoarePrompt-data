Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. The values of `x`, `dep`, `i`, `ss[x]`, and `query[x]` remain unchanged. `nowlistindex` is still the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds. The value of `j` is updated to the next element in `ans[fa[x]]` or remains as `fa[x]` if no next element exists. 
Output State: **`ans[x][dep + i]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]] or fa[x] if no next element exists**
