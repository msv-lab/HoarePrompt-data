Example Answer:
`ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. As `ans[x][j]` was initially an empty set, it will now contain the same elements as `ans[fa[x]][j]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans[x][j]` contains the elements of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[x][j]` contains the elements of `ans[fa[x]][j]`**
