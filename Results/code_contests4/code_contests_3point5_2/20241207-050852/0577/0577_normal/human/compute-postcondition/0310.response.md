Functionality: **The function `func_1` iterates through a series of calculations and assignments based on the values of the parameters `x` and `dep`. It updates various data structures and variables within nested conditions and loops. The final state of the program after the loop is that all variables have reached their final values. The loop control variable `x` is set to -1, indicating loop termination. The functionality and return value of the function are not explicitly defined, making it unclear what the purpose or outcome of the function is.**
