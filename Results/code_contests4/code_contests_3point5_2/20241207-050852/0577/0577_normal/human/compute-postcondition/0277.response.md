Postcondition: ***After not entering the if condition, `j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `fa[x]` are all updated based on the conditions. The length of `ans[x]` is not less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, for the loop to execute `ans[fa[x]]` is not empty. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then the program continues with the updated values. If `j` is in `ans[x]`, the length of `ans[x][j]` is compared to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. If `ans[x][j]` is longer, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared; otherwise, `ans[x][j]` takes the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
