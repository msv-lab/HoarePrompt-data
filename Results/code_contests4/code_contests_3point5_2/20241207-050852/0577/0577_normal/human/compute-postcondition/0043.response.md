Example Answer:
The `clear()` method is called on the list stored at `ans[x][j]`, which will remove all elements from that list. The actual values stored in the list `ans` and the indices `x` and `fa[x]` are unknown, so the output state will depend on the initial values stored in the list `ans` at index `x` and the value of `j`.
Output State: **The list stored at ans[x][j] is cleared**
