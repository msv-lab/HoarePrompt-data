Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x], query[x] has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is 0; `i` is the first element of `query[x]`, `j` is the second element of `query[x]. If dep + i is not in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is assigned the value 0. If dep + i is in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
