Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[x]`. If `j` is not in `ans[x]`, then the function updates `ans[x][j]` to the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is in `ans[x]` and the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the function updates the value at index `j` in `ans[x]` with the bitwise OR of the values at index `j` in `ans[x]` and `ans[fa[x]]`, and clears the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`. Otherwise, the function copies the `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]` to the `j`-th element of `ans[x]`.***
