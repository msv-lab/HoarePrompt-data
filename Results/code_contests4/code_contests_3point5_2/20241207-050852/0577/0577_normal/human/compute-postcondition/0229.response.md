Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `j` will be updated based on the conditions, `nowlistindex` will reach the end of `query[x]`, `i` will be assigned the last value from `query[x]`, `answer[j]` will be determined by whether `dep + i` is in `ans[x] or not, and answer[j]` will be assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i] if the condition is met.**
