Postcondition: ***`j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `answer[j]`, `ans[x]`, `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[x][j]` are updated based on conditions for the next iteration of the loop. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the list `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared and assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. Otherwise, no change occurs in the values of the mentioned variables.***
