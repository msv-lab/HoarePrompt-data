Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of strings, `x` is a valid index in `ans`, `fa[x]` is a valid index in `ans` with a longer string length than the string at index `x` in `ans` for the loop to execute. The character `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]`. The length of the string at index `x` in `ans` is greater than or equal to the length of the string at index `fa[x]` in `ans` for character `j`***
