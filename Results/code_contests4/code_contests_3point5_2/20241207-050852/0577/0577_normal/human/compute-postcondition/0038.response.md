Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of strings, `x` is a valid index in `ans`, `fa[x]` is a valid index in `ans` with a longer string length than the string at index `x` in `ans` for the loop to execute. The character `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of the string at index `x` and character `j` is less than the length of the string at index `fa[x]` and character `j`, then the element at index `x` of `ans` list and element at index `j` of that sublist are cleared. Otherwise, the character `j` in the string at index `x` in `ans` is updated with the result of the bitwise OR operation between the character `j` in the strings at index `x` and `fa[x]` in `ans`.***
