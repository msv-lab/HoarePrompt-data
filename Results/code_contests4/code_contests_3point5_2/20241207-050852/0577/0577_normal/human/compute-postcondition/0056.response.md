Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of strings, `x` is a valid index in `ans`, `fa[x]` is a valid index in `ans` with a longer string length than the string at index `x` in `ans` for the loop to execute one more time. If the length of the string at position `j` in the list at index `x` is less than the length of the string at position `j` in the list at index `fa[x]`, then the string at position `j` in the list at index `x` is cleared. Otherwise, the string at position `j` in the list at index `fa[x]` is replaced with the string at position `j` in the list at index `x`.***
