Postcondition: ***Output State: `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x], `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`. If `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`, then the state remains unchanged. If `j` is present in `ans[fa[x]]`, the state is updated as follows: if the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[fa[x]][j]` is updated by combining the values from `ans[x][j]` and `ans[x][j]` is cleared. However, if the length of `ans[x][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
