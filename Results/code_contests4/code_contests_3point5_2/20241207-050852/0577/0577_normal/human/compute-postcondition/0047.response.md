Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of strings, `x` is a valid index in `ans`, `fa[x]` is a valid index in `ans` with a longer string length than the string at index `x` in `ans`. If the length of the string at `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of the string at `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then the list stored at `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans` is updated after performing a bitwise OR operation where the string at index `j` of the list at index `fa[x]` is cleared.***
