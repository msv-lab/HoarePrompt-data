Example Answer:
The value of `dep` is decremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is updated to `fa[x] and `dep` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **The value of `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is updated to `fa[x] and `dep` is decreased by 1**
