Postcondition: ***`j` is updated according to the if-else condition, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 4, `i` retains its original value. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `j` is set to 0. Otherwise, `j` is updated to a new value. Additionally, if `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is not modified. However, if `dep + i` is present in `ans[x]`, `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
