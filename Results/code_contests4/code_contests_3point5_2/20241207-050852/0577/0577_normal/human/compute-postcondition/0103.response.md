Postcondition: ***`x`, `nowChild[x]`, `fa[x]`, `dep`, `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `lenChild[x]` are all integer variables. If `nowChild[x]` is equal to `lenChild[x]`, `x` is updated to a new value based on `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged, and `dep` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`, and `dep` is decreased by 1.***
