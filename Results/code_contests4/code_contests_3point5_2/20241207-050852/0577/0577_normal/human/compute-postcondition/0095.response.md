Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer. If the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, the string at index `x` in `ans` is cleared. If the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[fa[x]]` is cleared and assigned the value of `ans[x]`.***
