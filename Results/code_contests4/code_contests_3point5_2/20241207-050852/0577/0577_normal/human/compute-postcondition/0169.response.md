Example Answer:
The code snippet clears the content of ans[fa[x]][j]. Therefore, the union of ans[x][j] with ans[fa[x]][j] will no longer include any elements from ans[fa[x]][j]. All other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **ans[x][j] is updated with the union of ans[fa[x]][j] without the previous elements from ans[fa[x]][j] being included**
