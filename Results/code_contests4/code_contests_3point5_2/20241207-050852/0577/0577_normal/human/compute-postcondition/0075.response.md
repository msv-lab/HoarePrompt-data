Example Answer:
The value of `ans[x][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[fa[x]][j]`. Based on the initial state, it is known that the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, and `j` is in `ans[x]`. Therefore, the value of `ans[x][j]` is updated to the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the length of `ans[x]` is greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `j` is in `ans[x]`, `ans[x][j]` is updated to the value at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]**
