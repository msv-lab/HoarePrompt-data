Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of strings, `x` is a valid index in `ans`, `fa[x]` is a valid index in `ans` with a longer string length than the string at index `x` in `ans`. If `j` is not in the string at index `fa[x]` of `ans`, the string at index `j` in `ans[x]` is assigned to the string at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]`. If `j` is in the string at index `fa[x]` of `ans`, then if the length of the string at `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of the string at `ans[fa[x]][j]`, the list stored at `ans[x][j]` is cleared. Otherwise, `ans` is updated after performing a bitwise OR operation where the string at index `j` of the list at index `fa[x]` is cleared.***
