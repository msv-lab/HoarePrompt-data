Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is 4, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is updated to `query[x][5]`. If dep + i is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. If dep + i is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
