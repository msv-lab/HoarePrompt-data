Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. The value of `nowChild[x]` is not equal to `lenChild[x]`, so `x` is assigned a value from `Child[x]` based on the index `nowChild[x]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: *all variables remain the same. nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x], x is assigned a value from Child[x] based on the index nowChild[x].
Output State: ***all variables remain the same. nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x], x is assigned a value from Child[x] based on the index nowChild[x]***
