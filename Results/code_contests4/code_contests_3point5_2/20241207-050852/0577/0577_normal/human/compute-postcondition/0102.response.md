Example Answer:
`dep` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dep` is unknown, so after execution, `dep` will be increased by 1. The values of `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to a new value based on `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged, and `dep` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`x` is updated to a new value based on `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x] and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged, `dep` is incremented by 1**
