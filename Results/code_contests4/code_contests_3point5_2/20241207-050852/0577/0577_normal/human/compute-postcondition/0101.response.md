Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated to `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`. Since the condition `nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x]` is satisfied after not entering the if block, the values of `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is updated to a new value based on `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`x` is updated to a new value based on `Child[x][nowChild[x]]`, `nowChild[x]` and `lenChild[x]` remain unchanged.**
