Example Answer:
`dep` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dep` is unknown, so after execution, `dep` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `all variables remain the same. nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x], x is assigned a value from Child[x] based on the index nowChild[x]; dep is increased by 1.
Output State: **all variables remain the same. nowChild[x] is not equal to lenChild[x], x is assigned a value from Child[x] based on the index nowChild[x]; dep is increased by 1**
