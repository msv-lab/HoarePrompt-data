Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` is not equal to 0, then the following changes occur: `ans[x][dep]` becomes a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the second to last element of `query[x]`. If dep + i is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is set to 0. If dep + i is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. Additionally, if the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]]`, `ans[x][dep]` becomes an empty set, merging all elements in `ans[x]` with their corresponding elements in `ans[fa[x]] if they exist, otherwise, they remain unchanged. If the condition is false, `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned the value of `ans[x]`.***
