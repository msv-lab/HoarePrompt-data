Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The values of `fa[x]`, `j`, and `x` are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x], `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`. Additionally, `j` is not in `ans[fa[x]]`.
Output State: **`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x], `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the first element in `ans[x]`.
