Postcondition: ***`x` is assigned a value other than -1, `nowChild` and `lenChild` are equal at index `x`, `x` is not equal to 0, `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has a length of at least 2, `nowlistindex` is 2, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. If dep + i is not in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is assigned 0. Otherwise, if dep + i is in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`.***
