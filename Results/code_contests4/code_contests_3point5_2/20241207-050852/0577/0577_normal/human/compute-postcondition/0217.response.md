Output State: **All variables are maintained as described. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nowlistindex` needs to be incremented by 2 and should still be within the range of `query[x]`. `i` is assigned the value `query[x][nowlistindex]`.**
