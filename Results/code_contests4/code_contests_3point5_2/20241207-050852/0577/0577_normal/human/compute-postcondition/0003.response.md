Example Answer:
`ans[x][dep]` is assigned a set containing the value of `ss[x]`. Since `x` is not -1 and `nowChild` and `lenChild` are equal at index `x`, the value of `ss[x]` is included in the set. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned a value other than -1. The values of `nowChild` and `lenChild` are equal at index `x`. `x` is not equal to 0, and `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`.
Output State: **`x` is assigned a value other than -1. The values of `nowChild` and `lenChild` are equal at index `x`. `x` is not equal to 0, and `ans[x][dep]` is a set containing the value of `ss[x]`**
