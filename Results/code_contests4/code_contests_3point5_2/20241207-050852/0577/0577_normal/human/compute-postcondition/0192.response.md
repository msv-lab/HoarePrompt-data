Postcondition: ***Output State: `ans[x][dep + i]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is the index of the last element in `query[x]` or the last index before it goes out of bounds, `i` is the last element of `query[x]`, `j` is the next element in `ans[fa[x]] or fa[x] if no next element exists. If `len(ans[x][j]) > len(ans[fa[x]][j])`, `ans[x][j]` is updated to contain the union of `ans[fa[x]][j]` and its previous value, and `ans[fa[x]][j]` becomes an empty set. If the length condition is not met, `ans[x][j]` contains the elements of `ans[fa[x]][j]`.***
