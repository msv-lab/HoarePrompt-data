Example Answer:
`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`. The value of `ans[x][j]` is unknown, but `ans[fa[x]][j]` is cleared initially. So after execution, `ans[fa[x]][j]` will take the value of `ans[x][j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.
Output State: **`ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`**
