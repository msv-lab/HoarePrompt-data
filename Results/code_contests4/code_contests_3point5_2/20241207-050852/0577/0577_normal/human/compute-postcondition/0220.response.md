Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, and `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2. Then, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. The length of `ans[x][dep + i]` is calculated and assigned to `answer[j]`. The previous values of `j`, `nowlistindex`, `i`, `ans[x][dep + i]`, and `answer[j]` are not provided, so the output state is not determinable.
Output State: **Output state is not determinable**
