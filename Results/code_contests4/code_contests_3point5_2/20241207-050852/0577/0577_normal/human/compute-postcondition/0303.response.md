Example Answer:
The value of `dep` is decreased by 1. The values of `x`, `fa[x]`, and `nowChild[x]` are not impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x] and `nowChild[x] is incremented by 1; `dep` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **The value of `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x] and `nowChild[x] is incremented by 1; `dep` is decreased by 1**
