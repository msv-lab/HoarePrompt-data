The value of `answer[j]` is assigned 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nowChild[x]`, `lenChild[x]`, `fa[x]`, `dep`, `Child`, `ans[x][dep]`, `i`, `j`, `ans[x][dep]` is assigned the value of `{ss[x]}`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is 0, `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`.
