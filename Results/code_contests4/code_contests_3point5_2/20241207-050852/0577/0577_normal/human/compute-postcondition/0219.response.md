Example Answer:
`answer[j]` is assigned the value 0, where `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`. The value of `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2 within the range of `query[x]`, and `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `answer[j]` is assigned 0.
Output State: **`j` is the value of `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `nowlistindex` is incremented by 2, `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `answer[j]` is assigned 0**
