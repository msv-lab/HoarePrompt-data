Postcondition: ***`j` is updated based on conditions, `nowlistindex` reaches the end of `query[x]`, `i` is assigned the last value from `query[x]`, `answer[j]` is determined by a condition, `ans[x]` has at least 1 element, and the length of `ans[x]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]` for the loop to execute. Additionally, `j` is in `ans[fa[x]]`. If the length of `ans[x][j]` is less than the length of `ans[fa[x]][j]`, then `ans[x][j]` is cleared by removing all elements. Otherwise, `ans[fa[x]][j]` is assigned the value of `ans[x][j]`.***
