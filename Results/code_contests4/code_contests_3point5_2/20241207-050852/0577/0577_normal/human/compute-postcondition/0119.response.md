Postcondition: ***`ans[x][dep]` is a set containing `ss[x]`, `query[x]` has at least 1 element, `nowlistindex` is 2, updated values of `i` is assigned the value of `query[x][nowlistindex]`, `j` is updated to `query[x][nowlistindex + 1]`, `answer[j]` is updated based on `dep + i` in `ans[x] if present. If dep + i not in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is set to 0. If dep + i is in ans[x], then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`***
