Example Answer:
The `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]` is assigned to the `j`-th element of `ans[x]`. The length of `ans[x]` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the length of `ans[fa[x]]`. Therefore, the element at index `j` in `ans[fa[x]]` is copied to the element at index `j` in `ans[x]`.
Output State: **`ans` is a list, `x` is an integer, `fa` is a list, the `j`-th element of `ans[fa[x]]` is copied to the `j`-th element of `ans[x]`**
