Example Answer:
The value of `nowChild[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`. The previous values of `nowChild[x]` and `x` are unknown, so the output state is: variable `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, and `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`.
Output State: **variable `nowChild[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is updated to the value of `fa[x]`**
