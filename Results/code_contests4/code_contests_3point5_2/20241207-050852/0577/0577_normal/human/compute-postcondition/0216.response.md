According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `query[x]`. If the length of `query[x]` is greater than `nowlistindex`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nowlistindex` is at a certain value within the range of `query[x]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nowlistindex` needs to be incremented by 2 and it should still be within the range of `query[x]`.
State: **All variables are maintained as described. If `dep + i` is not in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is 0. If `dep + i` is in `ans[x]`, then `answer[j]` is assigned the length of `ans[x][dep + i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nowlistindex` needs to be incremented by 2 and should still be within the range of `query[x]`.**
