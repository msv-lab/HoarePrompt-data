    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: All variables have reached their final values based on the conditions and assignments within the loop. The loop control variable `x` is set to -1, indicating the loop termination. A series of assignments and comparisons have been made between various variables based on the loop conditions, resulting in their final values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` iterates through a series of calculations and assignments based on the values of the parameters `x` and `dep`. It updates various data structures and variables within nested conditions and loops. The final state of the program after the loop is that all variables have reached their final values. The loop control variable `x` is set to -1, indicating loop termination. The functionality and return value of the function are not explicitly defined, making it unclear what the purpose or outcome of the function is.
