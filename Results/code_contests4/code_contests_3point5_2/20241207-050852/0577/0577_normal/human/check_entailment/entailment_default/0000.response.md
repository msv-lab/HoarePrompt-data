Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` seems to be overly complex and difficult to understand. The output hints do not provide a clear explanation of the purpose or outcome of the function. The code lacks clarity and does not seem to handle all cases as described in the problem description. Without a clear understanding of the function's logic and purpose, it is difficult to determine if the code is correct. Further analysis and simplification of the function are needed to ensure correctness.
