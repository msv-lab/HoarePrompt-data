Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not seem to be related to the problem description given. The function `func_1` is performing some operations on data structures without any clear connection to the family tree problem described in the problem statement. Additionally, the purpose or expected output of the function is not defined, making it impossible to assess its correctness in relation to the given problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
