Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not cover all possible combinations of A, B, and C syllables to determine if a Haiku can be constructed. It only checks for specific combinations of A, B, and C, but there are other valid combinations that would also result in a Haiku. 

For example, if the input is 5 7 5, the program will output 'NO', even though it is possible to construct a Haiku with those syllable counts. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
