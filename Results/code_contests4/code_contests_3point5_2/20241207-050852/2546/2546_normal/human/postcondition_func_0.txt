The function `func` reads three integers A, B, and C from the user input. It then checks the values of A, B, and C to determine if they match specific conditions. If A = 5, B = 5, and C = 7, or A = 5, B = 7, and C = 5, or A = 7, B = 5, and C = 5, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value. Edge cases and missing functionality include situations where the input values do not match any of the specified conditions.
