Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description. It checks if the input values match the specific conditions required to construct a Haiku by using each phrase once in some order. The code covers all possible cases where A = 5, B = 5, C = 7 or A = 5, B = 7, C = 5 or A = 7, B = 5, C = 5 and prints 'YES' in those cases. Since the code covers all the scenarios provided in the problem description, it can be considered correct.
