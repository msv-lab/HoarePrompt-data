Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by checking if the input values A, B, and C match specific conditions to determine if a Haiku can be constructed. It handles all possible cases where A = 5, B = 5, and C = 7, or A = 5, B = 7, and C = 5, or A = 7, B = 5, and C = 5, and prints 'YES' accordingly. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The program covers all scenarios as described in the problem description, making it correct.
