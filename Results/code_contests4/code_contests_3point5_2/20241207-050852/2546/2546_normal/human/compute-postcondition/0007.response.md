Postcondition: ***A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10. a, b, and c are not all equal to 5, or c is not equal to 7 in case a and b are 5, and (a is not equal to 5 or b is not equal to 7 or c is not equal to 5). Additionally, after entering the if condition, a is equal to 7, b is equal to 5, and c is equal to 5.***
