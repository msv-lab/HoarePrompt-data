Postcondition: ***A, B, C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10. a, b, and c are not all equal to 5, or c is not equal to 7 in case a and b are 5, and (a is not equal to 5 or b is not equal to 7 or c is not equal to 5). If a == 7 and b == 5 and c == 5, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.***
