Postcondition: ***A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10. a, b, and c are not all equal to 5, or c is not equal to 7 if a and b are 5. If a == 5 and b == 7 and c == 5, 'YES' is printed. If a == 7 and b == 5 and c == 5, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.***
