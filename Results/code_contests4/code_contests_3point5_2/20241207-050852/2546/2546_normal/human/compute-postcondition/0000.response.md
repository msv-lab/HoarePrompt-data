Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 1 and 10. Therefore, the Output State is: A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10.
Output State: **A, B, and C are integers such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 10**
