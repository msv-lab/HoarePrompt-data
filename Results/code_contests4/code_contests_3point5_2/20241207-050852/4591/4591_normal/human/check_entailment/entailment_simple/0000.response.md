Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly calculates the cube root of the input positive integer q using the provided recurrence formula and stops the calculation when the absolute difference between the cube of x and q is less than 0.00001*q. The program handles multiple datasets as specified and outputs the approximate cube root of q for each dataset. The program uses the correct formula and termination condition as described in the problem statement.
