Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It takes a positive integer q as input, initializes x as q/2.0, calculates the cube root of q using the Newton-Raphson method within a while loop, and stops the calculation when the absolute difference between the cube of x and q is less than 0.00001*q. It then prints the result with 6 decimal places. The program handles the case where q is -1 to break out of the loop, as specified in the problem description. The algorithm implemented in the code aligns with the recurrence formula provided in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases.
