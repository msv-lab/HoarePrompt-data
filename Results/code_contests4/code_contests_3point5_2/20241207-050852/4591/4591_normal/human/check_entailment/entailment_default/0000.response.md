Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code follows the problem description by reading the input from the standard input, calculating the cube root of the input using the Newton-Raphson method, and printing the result with 6 decimal places.
- The code correctly handles the case where the input `q` is -1 to break out of the loop.
- It iterates until the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`, which is consistent with the problem description.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code accurately computes the cube root using the provided algorithm.
