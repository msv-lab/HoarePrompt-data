Example Answer:
After running the code snippet, `x` is updated using the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the solution to the equation x^3 = q. The loop will continue running until the absolute difference between x^3 and q is greater than or equal to `diff`. The variables `q` and `diff` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`q` equals -1, `q` is assigned the integer value from the input line, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the updated solution to the equation x^3 = q, the formatted value of `x` is printed, for the loop to execute again, the absolute difference between x^3 and q must be greater than or equal to `diff`.**
