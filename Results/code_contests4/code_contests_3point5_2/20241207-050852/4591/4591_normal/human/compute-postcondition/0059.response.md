Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated based on the formula provided. The value of `q` remains the same as it was obtained from `line`. The value of `diff` also remains the same. The absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` being less than `diff` is a condition that is maintained after updating `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`, `x` is updated based on the formula provided, `diff` remains the same, the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`.
Output State: **`line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`, `x` is updated based on the formula provided, `diff` remains the same, the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`**
