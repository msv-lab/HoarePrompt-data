Example Answer:
`diff` is assigned the value of `q` multiplied by 1e-05. The value of `q` may be -1, in which case it will be replaced by the integer value from the input line. The equation x^3 = q will be solved to find the value of `x`, which will be q^(1/3) after the loop execution. Finally, `x` is assigned the value of q / 2.0.
Output State: **`q` is an integer. If `q` equals -1, `q` is assigned the integer value from the input line, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, or x = q^(1/3) after the loop execution, with the formatted value of `x` printed, `x` is q / 2.0**
