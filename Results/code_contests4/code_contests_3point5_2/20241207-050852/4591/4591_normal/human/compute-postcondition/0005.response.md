Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is calculated by dividing `q` by 2.0. If `q` is a positive integer, the value of `x` will be half of `q`. However, if `q` is equal to -1, the value of `q` changes to -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer or -1, `x` is calculated based on the value of `q`.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer or -1, `x` is calculated based on the value of `q`**
