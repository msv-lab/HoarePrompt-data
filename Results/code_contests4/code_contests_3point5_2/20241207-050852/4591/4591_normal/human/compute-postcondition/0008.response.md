Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated based on the given formula. The value of `q` determines the value of `diff` as either a small positive value or -0.00001. The calculation involves `x`, `x ** 3`, `q`, and `3 * x * x`. After running the code, `x` will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1, and `x` is updated based on the formula provided**
