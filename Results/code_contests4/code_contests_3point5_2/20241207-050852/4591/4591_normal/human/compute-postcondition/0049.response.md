According to the code, the loop will execute indefinitely due to `while True`. The loop continues until there's a `break` statement encountered within the loop body. Since the loop will execute at least one time, the initial state right before the loop remains the same.
State: **`line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`, if `q` is equal to -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x` is assigned the value of `q / 2.0`, `diff` is assigned the value of `q * 1e-05`**
