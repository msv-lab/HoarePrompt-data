According to the code, the `while True` loop will execute indefinitely until a break statement is encountered within the loop body. The condition for breaking out of the loop is when the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows: `q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1, `x` is updated based on the formula provided.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` must be updated based on the formula provided. Additionally, if `q` is a positive integer, `diff` should remain a small positive value. If `q` is -1, `diff` should remain -0.00001.

State: **`q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1, `x` is updated based on the formula provided for the loop to execute again**
