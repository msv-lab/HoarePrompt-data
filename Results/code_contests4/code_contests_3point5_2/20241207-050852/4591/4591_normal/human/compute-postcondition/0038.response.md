Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated using the given formula to approximate the solution to the equation x^3 = q. The value of `q` is assigned an integer from the input line, and `diff` is calculated as q * 1e-05. The loop continues until the absolute difference between x^3 and q is greater than or equal to `diff`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is assigned the integer value from the input line, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the updated solution to the equation x^3 = q, the formatted value of `x` is printed, and the loop continues based on the condition mentioned.
Output State: **`q` is assigned the integer value from the input line, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the updated solution to the equation x^3 = q, the formatted value of `x` is printed, the loop continues based on the condition mentioned**
