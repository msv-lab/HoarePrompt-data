Output State: **After completing all iterations of the loop, `q` remains an integer, `diff` stays the same, `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, and the formatted value of `x` is printed. The loop continues to execute until the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`, at which point the loop terminates.**
