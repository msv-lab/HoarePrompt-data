Example Answer:
`diff` is assigned the value `q * 1e-05`. Since `q` is a positive integer or -1, the value of `diff` will be `q * 1e-05` where `1e-05` is scientific notation for 0.00001. If `q` is a positive integer, `diff` will be a small positive value, and if `q` is -1, `diff` will be -0.00001. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1**
