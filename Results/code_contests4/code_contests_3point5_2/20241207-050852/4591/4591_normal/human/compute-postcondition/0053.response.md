Postcondition: ***`line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`, if `q` is equal to -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `x` is updated based on the formula provided. `diff` remains the same. If the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`, then the program continues execution.***
