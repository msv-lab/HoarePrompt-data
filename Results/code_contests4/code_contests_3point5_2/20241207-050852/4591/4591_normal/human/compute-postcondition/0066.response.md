Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from standard input, calculates the cube root of the input using the Newton-Raphson method, and prints the result with 6 decimal places. The function does not accept any explicit parameters. The code handles the case where the input `q` is -1 to break out of the loop. It iterates until the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`. It accurately computes the cube root using the algorithm provided in the code.**
