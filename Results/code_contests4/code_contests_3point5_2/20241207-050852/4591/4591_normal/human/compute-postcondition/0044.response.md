Example Answer:
`q` is assigned the value `int(line)`. The value of `line` is obtained from the standard input, and it must be available for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`.
Output State: **`line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`**
