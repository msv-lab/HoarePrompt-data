Example Answer:
`x` is updated by the formula provided. The initial value of `x` is `q / 2.0`, so after the execution, `x` will be updated accordingly. The `diff` variable remains unaffected as it is not used in the formula. If `q` is equal to -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`, if `q` is equal to -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x` is updated based on the formula provided, `diff` remains the same.
Output State: **`line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`, if `q` is equal to -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x` is updated based on the formula provided, `diff` remains the same**
