Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the updated solution to the equation x^3 = q, and the formatted value of `x` is printed. The loop continues based on the condition mentioned. When the absolute difference between x^3 and q is less than diff, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
