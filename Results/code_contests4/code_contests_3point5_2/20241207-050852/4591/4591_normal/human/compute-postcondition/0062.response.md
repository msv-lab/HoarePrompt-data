Output State: `line` must be available for input, `q` is an integer obtained from `line`, if `q` is equal to -1, the program breaks out. `x` is updated based on the formula provided in the loop. `diff` remains the same. The loop continues executing until the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`, at which point the loop terminates.
