According to the code, the loop will keep executing as long as there are lines to read from the standard input (stdin). At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1, and `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, or x = q^(1/3) after the loop execution.

For the loop to execute one more time, the standard input (stdin) should have another line to read.
State: **`q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1, `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, or x = q^(1/3) after the loop execution and the formatted value of `x` is printed, there is at least one more line to read from the standard input (stdin)**
