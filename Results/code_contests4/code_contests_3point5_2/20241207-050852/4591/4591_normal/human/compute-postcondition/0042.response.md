Example Answer:
The value of `x` is formatted with 6 decimal places and printed using the `print` function. The value of `x` is `q / 2.0`, and `q` is an integer, so the value of `x` is half of `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is an integer, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, the formatted value of `x` is printed, `x` is q / 2.0.
Output State: **`q` is an integer, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, the formatted value of `x` is printed, `x` is q / 2.0**
