Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer or -1, `diff` is a small positive value if `q` is positive and -0.00001 if `q` is -1, `x` is updated based on the formula provided. If the absolute difference between the cube of `x` and `q` is less than `diff`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
