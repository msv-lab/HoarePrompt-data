Example Answer:
`x` is recalculated based on the given equation. The value of `x` is updated iteratively until it converges to the solution. The values of `q` and `diff` remain constant. After the loop execution, `x` will hold the solution to the equation x^3 = q. The formatted value of `x` is printed, and then `x` is updated to q / 2.0. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` equals -1, `q` is assigned the integer value from the input line, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, the formatted value of `x` is printed, `x` is q / 2.0.
Output State: **`q` equals -1, `q` is assigned the integer value from the input line, `diff` is q * 1e-05, `x` is the solution to the equation x^3 = q, the formatted value of `x` is printed, `x` is q / 2.0**
