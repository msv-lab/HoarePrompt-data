Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by iterating through the recurrence formula until the absolute difference between $x^3$ and $q$ is less than $0.00001 * q$. It handles multiple datasets, stops the calculation when the condition is met, and prints the approximate cube root of $q$ with an error margin of 0.00001 or less. The program seems to work correctly for all potential cases and inputs provided in the problem description.
