Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program follows the given problem description accurately. It calculates the cube root approximation of a given positive integer q using the provided recurrence formula and stopping condition. The program iterates until the condition $ | x ^ 3 - q | < 0.00001 q $ is met, and then prints the approximation with an error margin of 0.00001. The program also handles multiple datasets until -1 is encountered as input.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
