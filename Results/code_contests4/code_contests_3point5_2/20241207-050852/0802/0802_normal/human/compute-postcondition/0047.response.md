According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement inside the loop body. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next element in `K` and `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i+1, sum, next k in K`**
