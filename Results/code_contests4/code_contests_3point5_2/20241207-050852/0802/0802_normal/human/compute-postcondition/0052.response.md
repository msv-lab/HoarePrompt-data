Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `d, n, m, f, S, K, i+1, sum, next k in K` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i+1, sum, next k in K` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
