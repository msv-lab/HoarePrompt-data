Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely. Therefore, all variables can remain the same except for `i`, which is increased by 1 after each iteration to ensure progress in the loop.
State: **All variables remain the same except `i` which is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time due to `while True`**
