Since the `while` loop is an infinite loop due to `while True`, the loop will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, the states remain the same as they were right before the loop:
State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same, loop control variable `k` is updated to the next element in `K` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is assigned the value 1**
