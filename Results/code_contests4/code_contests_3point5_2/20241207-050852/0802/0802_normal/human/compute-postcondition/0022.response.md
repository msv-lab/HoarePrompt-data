Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the variable `sum`. The initial value of `sum` is unknown, and `i` is the loop control variable that will be increased until the condition is met. Therefore, the Output State is: `d, n, m, f, S, K, i` remain the same, loop control variable `i` will be increased until the condition is met, loop will terminate once condition is met, `sum` is incremented by the value of `i`.
Output State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i` remain the same, loop control variable `i` will be increased until the condition is met, loop will terminate once condition is met, `sum` is incremented by the value of `i`**
