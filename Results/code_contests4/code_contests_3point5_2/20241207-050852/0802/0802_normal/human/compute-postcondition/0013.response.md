Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue indefinitely until there is a break statement within the loop body. Therefore, the loop will always execute one more time. No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables remain the same except `i` which is increased by 1, the loop will execute one more time due to `while True`**
