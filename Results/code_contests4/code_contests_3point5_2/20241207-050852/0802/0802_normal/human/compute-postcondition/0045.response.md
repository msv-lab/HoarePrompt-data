Postcondition: ***`d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same. The loop control variable `k` is updated to the next element in `K` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is assigned the value 1. If the condition ((k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S) is satisfied, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
