Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop body. Therefore, all states remain the same and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i+1, sum, k` remain the same for the loop to execute again**
