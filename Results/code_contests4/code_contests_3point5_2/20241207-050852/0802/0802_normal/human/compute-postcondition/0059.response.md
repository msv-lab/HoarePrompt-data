Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is written to the file `output.txt` as a string. The file object `f` is pointing to `output.txt` in write mode. The previous values of `d, n, m, f, S, K, i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same, the sum value is written to the file `output.txt`.
Output State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same, the sum value is written to the file `output.txt`**
