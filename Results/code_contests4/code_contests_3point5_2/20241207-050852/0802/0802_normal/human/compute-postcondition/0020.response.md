Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The loop continues to execute as long as `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in set S. The values of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except `i` which is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time due to `while True`. If `(k + i) % 8` or `(k - i) % 8` is in set S, the program continues to execute. Otherwise, the program exits the loop.**
