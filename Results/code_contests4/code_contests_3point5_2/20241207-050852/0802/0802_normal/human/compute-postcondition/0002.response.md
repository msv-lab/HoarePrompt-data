Example Answer:
The file object `f` is closed. The values of `d`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d, n, m` are positive integers such that 2 <= d <= 1000000000, 2 <= n <= 100000, 1 <= m <= 10000 and the file object `f` is closed.
Output State: **`d, n, m` are positive integers such that 2 <= d <= 1000000000, 2 <= n <= 100000, 1 <= m <= 10000 and the file object `f` is closed**
