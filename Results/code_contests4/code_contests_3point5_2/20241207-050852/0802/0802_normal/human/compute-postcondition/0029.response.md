Output State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same. Loop control variable `k` is updated to the next element in `K` for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is incremented by 1. If the sum of `k` and `i` modulo 8 is in `S` or the difference between `k` and `i` modulo 8 is in `S`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
