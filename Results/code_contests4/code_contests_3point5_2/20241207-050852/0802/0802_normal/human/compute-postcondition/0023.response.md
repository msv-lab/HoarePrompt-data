According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the loop control variable `k` and `K`. If there are more elements in `K` to iterate over, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `d, n, m, f, S, K, i` remain the same, `sum` is incremented by the value of `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the loop control variable `k` needs to be updated to the next element in `K`.
State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same, loop control variable `k` will be updated to the next element in `K` for the loop to execute one more time**
