Output State: **d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum remain the same. k is updated to the next element in K for the loop to execute one more time, i is assigned the value 1. The sum of k and i modulo 8 is in S or the difference between k and i modulo 8 is in S. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
