Example Answer:
The file `output.txt` is opened in write mode and assigned to the variable `f`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same, loop will terminate when the condition `(k + i) % 8 in S or (k - i) % 8 in S` is met for all elements in `K`, sum will be the sum of all `i` values accumulated during the iterations of the loop. `f` is the file object pointing to `output.txt` in write mode.
