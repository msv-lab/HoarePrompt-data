According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it can certainly execute one time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`d, n, m, f, S, K, i, sum` remain the same, loop control variable `k` will be updated to the next element in `K` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is assigned the value 1**
