Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous values of `sum` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `i_final`, `final k in K` remain unchanged, `sum` is incremented by the value of `i`.
Output State: **`d`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `S`, `K`, `i_final`, `final k in K` remain unchanged, `sum` is incremented by the value of `i`**
