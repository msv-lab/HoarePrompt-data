#State of the program right berfore the function call: d, n, m are positive integers such that 2 <= d <= 1000000000, 2 <= n <= 100000, 1 <= m <= 10000. The following n-1 lines contain integers d2, d3, ..., dn representing store locations, where 1 <= di <= d-1. The following m lines contain integers k1, k2, ..., km representing delivery destination locations, where 0 <= ki <= d.**

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from a file, processes store locations and delivery destinations based on certain conditions, calculates the sum of distances to the nearest store for each delivery destination, and writes the total sum to an output file. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads input from a file and writes output to another file.
