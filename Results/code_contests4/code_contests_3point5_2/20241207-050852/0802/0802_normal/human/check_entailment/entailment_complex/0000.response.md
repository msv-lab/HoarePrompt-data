Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

1. The program assumes that the distance `d` is always 8, which is incorrect. The distance `d` can be any positive integer up to 1000000000.
2. The program uses the modulo operator with 8 (`% 8`) which is not applicable to the problem description.
3. The program reads input from a file named `input.txt` and writes output to a file named `output.txt`, which is not mentioned in the problem description. The program should read input from standard input and write output to standard output.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
