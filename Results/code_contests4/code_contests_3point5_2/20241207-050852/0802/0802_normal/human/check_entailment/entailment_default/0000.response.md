Correctness: **False**

The code provided reads input from a file, processes store locations, and delivery destinations based on certain conditions to calculate the sum of distances to the nearest store for each delivery destination. However, there are some issues with the code:
1. The code calculates the distance using modulo operation with 8 instead of the total length of the loop line `d`.
2. The code only considers the nearest store in the clockwise direction and not in both directions.
3. The code does not handle the case where the nearest store is the main store.

Therefore, the code does not fully follow the problem description and hence is incorrect.
