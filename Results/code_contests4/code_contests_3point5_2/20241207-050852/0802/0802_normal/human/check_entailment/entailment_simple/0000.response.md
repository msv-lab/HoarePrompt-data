Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the problem description. 
1. The program uses a hardcoded value of 8 in the while loop condition instead of using the input value of d. 
2. The program does not handle the case when the loop line moves clockwise or counterclockwise, it only considers a single direction.
3. The logic inside the while loop is incorrect as it only checks the nearest store in one direction. The correct implementation should consider both directions and choose the store that requires the minimum distance to travel.

Overall, the program does not accurately calculate the total distance traveled during delivery as required by the problem description.
