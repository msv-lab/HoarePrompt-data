Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program reads input from a file named 'input.txt', processes it, and writes the output to a file named 'output.txt'. However, the provided problem description does not mention anything about reading from or writing to files. The program should take input from standard input (stdin) and output to standard output (stdout). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
