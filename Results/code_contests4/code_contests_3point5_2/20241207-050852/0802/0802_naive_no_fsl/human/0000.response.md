Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not calculate the total distance traveled during delivery correctly. The program uses hardcoded modulo operation with 8 (`% 8`) which does not align with the problem description where the total length of the loop line `d` can be any integer up to 1000000000.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the distance calculation according to the problem description for all potential cases.
