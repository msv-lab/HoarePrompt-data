According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is not equal to `n`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.
State: **`i` is 9, `sq` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
