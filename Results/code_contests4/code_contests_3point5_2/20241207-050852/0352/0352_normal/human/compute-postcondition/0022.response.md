The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function should generate and return a list of integers representing a shuffled deck of cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in the deck. The deck size n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to generate and return a shuffled deck of cards based on the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function generates and returns a shuffled deck of cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in the deck.**
