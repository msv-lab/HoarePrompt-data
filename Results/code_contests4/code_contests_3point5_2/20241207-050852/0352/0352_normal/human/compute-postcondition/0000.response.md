Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` represents the number of cards in the deck. Since the initial state does not provide any specific value for `n`, the output state will be: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52. c_1, c_2, ..., c_n are integers representing the cards in the deck and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in the deck.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 52. c_1, c_2, ..., c_n are integers representing the cards in the deck and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in the deck.**
