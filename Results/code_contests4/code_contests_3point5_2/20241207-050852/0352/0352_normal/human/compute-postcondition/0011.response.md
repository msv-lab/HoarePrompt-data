Example Answer: 
`i` is multiplied by 3, so if the initial value of `i` is 3, after execution, `i` becomes 9. The values of `sq` and `n` are not affected. Since `i` is not equal to `n`, the loop will execute again.
Output State: **`i` is 9, `sq` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will execute again as `i` is not equal to `n`.**
