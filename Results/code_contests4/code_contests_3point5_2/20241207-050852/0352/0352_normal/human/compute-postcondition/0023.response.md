Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from the user, then iterates through a while loop where i is multiplied by 3 until i is greater than n. If i equals n at any point, the variable sq is set to True. After the loop, if sq is True, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function essentially checks if n is a power of 3 and outputs 'YES' if it is, 'NO' otherwise. The annotations mention generating and shuffling a deck of cards, which is not reflected in the code.**
