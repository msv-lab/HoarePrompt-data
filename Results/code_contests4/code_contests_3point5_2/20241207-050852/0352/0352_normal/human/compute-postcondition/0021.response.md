Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than `n`, `sq` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to `n`, `sq` is True. Otherwise, `i` is greater than `n`, `sq` is True. If the condition is true, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed and the initial state of the variables remains unchanged.***
