According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is not equal to `n`, we need to adjust the values of the variables for the loop to execute one more time. 
State: **`i` is 3, `sq` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be less than `n`**
