Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not implement the required functionality described in the problem description. The program reads an integer `n` and then checks if `n` is a power of 3, printing 'YES' if it is and 'NO' if it is not. This does not align with the problem description, which requires sorting a deck of cards using a specific operation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
