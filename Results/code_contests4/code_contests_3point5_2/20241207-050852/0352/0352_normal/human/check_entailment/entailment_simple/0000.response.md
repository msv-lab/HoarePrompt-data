Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description at all. It seems to be a simple loop that checks if `i` becomes equal to `n` after multiplying `i` by 3 in each iteration. It then prints 'YES' if that condition is met, otherwise 'NO'. This has no relation to the problem description of sorting a deck of cards using a specific operation.

Therefore, the program does not do what the problem description asks for and is incorrect.
