Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided. It checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 26, which is the number of unique lowercase English letters. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct. If the length is greater than 26, it outputs -1 as it is impossible to make all substrings distinct. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
