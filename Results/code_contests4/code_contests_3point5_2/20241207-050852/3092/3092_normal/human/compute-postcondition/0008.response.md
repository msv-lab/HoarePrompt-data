Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, then `result` is calculated as the difference between the total number of characters in the string `s` and the number of unique characters in the string `s`. If `n` is greater than 26, then `result` is -1. The final output is the printed value of `result`.
Output State: **The value of `result` is printed.**
