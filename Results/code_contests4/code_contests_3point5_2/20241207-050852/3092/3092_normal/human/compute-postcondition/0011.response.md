Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `s`, where `n` is between 1 and 100,000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters of length `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between the total number of characters in the string `s` and the number of unique characters in `s` and prints the result. If `n` is greater than 26, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return a value but performs the calculations and prints the result.**
