Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters. If n <= 26, `result` is the difference between the total number of characters in the string `s` and the number of unique characters in the string `s`. If n > 26, `result` is -1.***
