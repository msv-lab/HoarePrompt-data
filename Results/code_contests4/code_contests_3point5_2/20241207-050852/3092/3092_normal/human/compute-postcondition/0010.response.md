The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. Instead, it expects the variables `n` and `s` to be defined globally. The parameter constraints specify that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters. The function `func` operates on these global variables `n` and `s` to perform a specific task or computation. The return value of the function will depend on the specific functionality implemented within the function body, which is not specified in the given information.
