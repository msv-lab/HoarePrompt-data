Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string. Since the input is accepted as raw_input(), the value of `s` will be the string entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters**
