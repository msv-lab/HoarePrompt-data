Example Answer: 
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - len(set(s))`, where `n` is the input integer and `s` is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters. The `set(s)` function removes duplicates from the string `s`, so `len(set(s))` gives the number of unique characters in the string. Therefore, after execution, `result` will be equal to the difference between the total number of characters in the string `s` and the number of unique characters in the string `s`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters, `result` is the difference between the total number of characters in the string `s` and the number of unique characters in the string `s`**
