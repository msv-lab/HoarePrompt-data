Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer n and a string s, where n is between 1 and 100,000, and s is a string of lowercase English letters of length n. If n is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between the total number of characters in the string s and the number of unique characters in s and prints the result. If n is greater than 26, it prints -1. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct, or determine that it is impossible. The program handles both cases and provides the correct output.
