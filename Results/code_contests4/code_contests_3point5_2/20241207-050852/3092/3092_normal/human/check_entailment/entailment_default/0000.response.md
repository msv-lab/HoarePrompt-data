Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer `n` and a string `s`, where `n` is between 1 and 100,000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters of length `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it calculates the difference between the total number of characters in the string `s` and the number of unique characters in `s` and prints the result. If `n` is greater than 26, it prints -1. The code covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The logic correctly determines the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct or determines if it's impossible.
