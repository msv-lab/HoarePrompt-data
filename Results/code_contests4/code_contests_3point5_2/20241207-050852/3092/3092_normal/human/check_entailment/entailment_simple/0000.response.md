Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if the total number of characters in the string `s` is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all substrings distinct by finding the difference between the total number of characters and the number of unique characters in the string. If the total number of characters is greater than 26, it outputs -1, indicating that it is impossible to make all substrings distinct.

The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Thus, the program is correct.
