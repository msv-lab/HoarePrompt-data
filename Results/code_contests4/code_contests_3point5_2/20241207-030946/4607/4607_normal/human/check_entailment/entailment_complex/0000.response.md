Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After carefully analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description. The code correctly determines the additional number that can be written on the card for Alexander to form an arithmetic progression with all his cards. The code considers scenarios where there is only one card, two cards with equal values, two cards with different values, and multiple cards with varying differences between them. The code also handles cases where there may be multiple valid solutions or no valid solution at all. Since the code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the annotations align with the code's functionality, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
