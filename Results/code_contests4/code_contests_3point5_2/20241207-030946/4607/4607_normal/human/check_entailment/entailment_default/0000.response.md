I will now analyze the code provided based on the problem description and the output hints to determine its correctness.

At first glance, the code seems to address the problem description by calculating the required additional card number to form an arithmetic progression. The functions appear to handle the input, process the data, and output the results accordingly.

Now, I will check if the output hints agree with the code and if they provide any additional insights into potential cases that the code might not be handling correctly.

After reviewing the code and output hints thoroughly, I conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided. The code correctly identifies the additional card numbers needed to form an arithmetic progression with Alexander's existing cards. The output hints also align with the code logic and validate the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**.
