The function `func_15` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It follows a series of conditions and loops to check if `n` is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself. If `n` passes all checks, the function returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. Otherwise, it returns False.
