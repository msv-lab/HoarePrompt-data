Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `g` contains the differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, and the length of the list of unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1. If 0 is in `l` and the length of the list of unique elements in `g` is greater than or equal to 2, then no variables are affected and the program exits immediately.***
