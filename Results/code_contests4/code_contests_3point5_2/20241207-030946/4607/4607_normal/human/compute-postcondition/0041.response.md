Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `g` contains the differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, and `i` is `n-1`. If the length of the list of unique elements in `g` is greater than 2, then the program does something specific based on that condition.***
