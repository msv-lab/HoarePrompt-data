Postcondition: ***`gc` needs to be recalculated, new elements may be appended to list `a` based on calculations for `x`. If the absolute difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `gc`, new elements may be appended to list `a` based on the calculations for `x`.***
