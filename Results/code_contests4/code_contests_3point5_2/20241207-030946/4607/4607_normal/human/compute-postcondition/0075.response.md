Postcondition: ***`gc` is the result of applying `func_14` to all elements in list `l` starting from the third element. If the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc`, then `x` is calculated as `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`, a new element is appended to list `a` based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
