Example Answer:
The value of `g` is appended with the result of `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` are the first and second elements of list `a`. The value of `n` being at least 2 ensures that there are at least 2 elements in list `a`. Therefore, the difference between the first and second elements of list `a` is calculated and appended to list `g`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` is an empty list, `g` contains the difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 0**
