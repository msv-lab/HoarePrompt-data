According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. In this case, at the end of the previous iteration, the output state is uncertain, meaning we don't have specific values for `i` and `n`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **Output state is uncertain, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i**.
