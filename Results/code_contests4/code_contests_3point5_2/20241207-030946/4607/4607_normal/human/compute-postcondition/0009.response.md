According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty with `x` being the first element in `args`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args` after `x`.
State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty with `x` being the second element in `args`**
