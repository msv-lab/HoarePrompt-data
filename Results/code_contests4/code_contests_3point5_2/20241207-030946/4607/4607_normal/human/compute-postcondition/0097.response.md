Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `l` contains unique elements sorted in ascending order, `g` contains the differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `l` are the same and the length of the list of unique elements in `g` is equal to 1, the function `func_18` is called with the argument 1. Otherwise, the elements of `l` are not all equal and the length of the list of unique elements in `g` is not equal to 1.***
