According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `gc` is the result of applying `func_14` to all elements in list `l` starting from the second element does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`gc` is the result of applying `func_14` to all elements in list `l` starting from the second element, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
