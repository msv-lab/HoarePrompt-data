Output State: **`gc` is the result of applying `func_14` to all elements in list `l` starting from the third element; `x` is calculated as `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2; list `a` has a new element appended to it where the value is calculated based on the formula `a[i] + (a[i + 1] - a[i]) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
