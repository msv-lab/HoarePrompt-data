Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned by popping 'sep' and 'file' keys from the `kwargs` dictionary with default values. If 'sep' key is not present in `kwargs`, `sep` takes the value ' ' (space). If 'file' key is not present in `kwargs`, `file` takes the value `sys.stdout`. The initial state does not provide information about the `kwargs` dictionary, so the output state will be as follows:
Output State: **`sep` is ' ' (space), `file` is sys.stdout**
