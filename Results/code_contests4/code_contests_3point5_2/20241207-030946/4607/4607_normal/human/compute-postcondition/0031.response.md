According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `g` contains the difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and become 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `g` contains the difference between the first and second elements of list `a`, `i` is 1**.
