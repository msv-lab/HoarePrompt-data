According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, `l` and `g` are empty lists. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is at least 2, `l` is an empty list, `g` is an empty list, and the `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` is an empty list, `g` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
