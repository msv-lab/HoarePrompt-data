Example Answer:
The list `l` is sorted in ascending order. The uniqueness of elements in `l` is preserved, and no duplicates are present. The other variables `n`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` contains unique elements sorted in ascending order, `g` contains the differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `i` is `n-1`**
