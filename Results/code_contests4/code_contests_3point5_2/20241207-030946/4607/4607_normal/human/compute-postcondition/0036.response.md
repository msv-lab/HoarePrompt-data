Example Answer:
The absolute difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in list `a` is calculated and appended to list `l`. Since `i` is 2, the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is calculated and appended to `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `g` contains the difference between the second and third elements of list `a`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `g` contains the difference between the second and third elements of list `a`, `i` is 2**
