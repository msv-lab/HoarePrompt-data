Postcondition: ***`l` contains the consecutive differences between elements of `a` in ascending order, `n` is the total number of elements in `l`, `i` is equal to `n - 1` at the end of the loop. If all elements in `l` are the same, the function `func_18` is called with the argument 1. Otherwise, the elements of `l` are not all equal.***
