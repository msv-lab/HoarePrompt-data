According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `gc` is reassigned a new value after calling `func_14` with parameters `gc` and `l[i]`, and `i` is at the last index of the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next index.
State: **`gc` is reassigned the value after calling `func_14` with parameters `gc` and `l[i+1]`**
