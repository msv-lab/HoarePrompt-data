Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. If n equals 1, the program returns n = 1. If n == 2 and a[0] == a[1], then n is equal to 1. List `l` contains a[0] plus half of the absolute difference between a[0] and a[1], a[0] - (a[1] - a[0]), a[1] + (a[1] - a[0]). The absolute value of the difference between a[0] and a[1] is divisible by 2 and stored in `g`. List `l` is sorted and the length of `l` is returned by the function `func_18`. `g` is an empty list.**
