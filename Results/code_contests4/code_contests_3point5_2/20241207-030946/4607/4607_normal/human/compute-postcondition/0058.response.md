According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of list `l` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `gc` is assigned the value of the first element in list `l`. In order for the loop to execute, `l` must have a length greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1.
State: **`gc` is assigned the value of the first element in list `l`, for the loop to execute `l` has a length greater than 1, `i` is 1**
