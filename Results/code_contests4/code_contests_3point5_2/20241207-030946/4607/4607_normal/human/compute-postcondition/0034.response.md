According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `g` contains the difference between the second and third elements of list `a`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `g` contains the difference between the second and third elements of list `a`, `i` is 2**
