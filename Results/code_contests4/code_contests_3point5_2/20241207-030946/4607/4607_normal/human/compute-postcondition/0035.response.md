Example Answer:
The value of `g` is appended with the absolute difference between the (i + 1)th and ith elements of list `a`. Since `i` is 2, the difference is between the 3rd and 2nd elements of list `a`. Therefore, the value of `g` is updated with this difference. The other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` contains the absolute differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `g` contains the difference between the second and third elements of list `a`, `i` is 2**
