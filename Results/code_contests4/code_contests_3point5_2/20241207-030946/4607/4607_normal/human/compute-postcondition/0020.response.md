Example Answer:
The `end` key is popped from `kwargs` with a default value of '\n'. The value of `end` can be any string or character. The `file` object writes the value of `end` to the output. Since `end` is popped and written to the `file`, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty with all elements in `args` being written to the `file` separated by the `sep`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty with all elements in `args` being written to the `file` separated by the `sep`**
