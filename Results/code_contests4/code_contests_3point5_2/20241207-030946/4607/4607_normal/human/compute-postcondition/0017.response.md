Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty with `x` being the third element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then the program continues with the same initial state as described in the precondition. The value of `x` is written as a string to the `file`.**
