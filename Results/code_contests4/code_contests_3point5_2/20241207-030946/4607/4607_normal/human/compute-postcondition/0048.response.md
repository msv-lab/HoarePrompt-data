Example Answer:
The function `func_18` is called with the length of list `l` as the argument. The length of `l` is `n`, so `func_18` is called with `n`. The function executes without modifying any of the given variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `l` contains unique elements sorted in ascending order, `g` contains the differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `i` is `n-1`.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` contains unique elements sorted in ascending order, `g` contains the differences between adjacent elements of list `a`, `i` is `n-1`**
