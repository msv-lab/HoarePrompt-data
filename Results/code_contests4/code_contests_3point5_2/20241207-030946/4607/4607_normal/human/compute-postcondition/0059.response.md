Example Answer:
`gc` is reassigned the value returned by `func_14` with parameters `gc` and `l[i]`. The previous value of `gc` is the first element in list `l`. The loop is executing with `i` as 1. Therefore, the output state is: `gc` is reassigned the value after calling `func_14` with parameters `gc` and `l[i]`.
Output State: **`gc` is reassigned the value after calling `func_14` with parameters `gc` and `l[i]`**
