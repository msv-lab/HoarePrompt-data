Example Answer: 
The `file.write(str(x))` statement writes the string representation of the second element in `args` (which is `x`) to the output file `file`. The separator `sep` is not used in this case. The variable `at_start` remains False. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty with `x` being the second element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty with `x` being the second element in `args`**
