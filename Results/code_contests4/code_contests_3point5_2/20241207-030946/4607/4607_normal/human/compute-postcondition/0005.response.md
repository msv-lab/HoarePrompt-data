Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file` which is `sys.stdout`. Given that `sep` is ' ', this means a space will be written to the standard output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty and `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty and `x` is the first element in `args`**
