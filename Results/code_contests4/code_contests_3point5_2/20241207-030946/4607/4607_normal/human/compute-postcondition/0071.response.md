According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `gc`. If the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is equal to `gc`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `gc` is the result of applying `func_14` to all elements in list `l` starting from the second element. The loop or if statement will break if the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` is not equal to `gc`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `gc` needs to be calculated for the next elements in the list, and the absolute difference between `a[i + 2]` and `a[i + 1]` must be equal to `gc`.
State: **`gc` is the result of applying `func_14` to all elements in list `l` starting from the third element, for the loop to execute one more time the absolute difference between `a[i + 2]` and `a[i + 1]` must be equal to `gc`**
