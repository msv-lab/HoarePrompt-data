According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of list `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `gc` is updated based on the return value of `func_14`. Since the loop starts at 1 and `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and become 2, and `len(l)` should be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`gc` is updated based on the return value of `func_14`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is 2, `len(l)` is greater than or equal to 2**
