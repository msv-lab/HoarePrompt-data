Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It checks for different scenarios like when there is only one card, two cards with the same number, two cards with a common difference, and multiple cards with a common difference. The program correctly calculates the number of integers that can be written on the card and the specific integers in each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
