Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct. The issue lies in the `func_2` function where the calculation for the sum of all elements at the end of the process is incorrect. The calculation should be based on the values after the robot processes the elements, but the current calculation does not handle the addition of x copies of the integer q/x to the end of the array.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input
```
1
3 2
2 4 6
```

Expected Output
```
28
```

Explanation:
- The initial array is [2, 4, 6] and x = 2.
- After processing the first element 2, the array becomes [2, 1, 1, 4, 6].
- After processing the second element 1, the array becomes [2, 1, 1, 4, 6, 2, 2].
- After processing the third element 1, the array becomes [2, 1, 1, 4, 6, 2, 2, 1, 1].
- The sum of the elements in the resulting array is 28, but the program would not produce this output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
