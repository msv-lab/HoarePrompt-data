The input consists of t test cases, where each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the value used by the robot. Each test case also contains a list of n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial values in the array.**
