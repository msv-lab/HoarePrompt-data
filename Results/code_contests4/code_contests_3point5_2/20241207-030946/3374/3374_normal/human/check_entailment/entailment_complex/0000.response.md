Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the number of test cases, the length of the array, the value used by the robot, and the initial values in the array as input.
- It calculates the count of divisions of each element in the array by the value used by the robot.
- It finds the minimum count of divisions and calculates a specific value based on the sum of the initial values, the minimum count, and a subset of the initial values.
- The calculated value is then passed to a function `func_2` for each test case, which prints the values as required.
- The program follows the problem description for every potential case, and the annotations align with the code logic.
