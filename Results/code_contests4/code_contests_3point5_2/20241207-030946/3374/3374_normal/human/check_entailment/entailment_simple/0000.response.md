Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fully implement the functionality described in the problem description. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function where it tries to call `func_2` with arguments that are not specified. Additionally, the `func_2` function definition is incomplete and lacks the necessary input parameters.

Furthermore, the logic within the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the robot's behavior as described in the problem. The calculation of `min_pow` and `min_idx` is not in line with the problem requirements, leading to incorrect results.

Overall, the program does not adhere to the problem description and is incomplete in its implementation.
