The function `func_1` reads an input integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a list of positive integers `a` with length `n`. It calculates the count of divisions of each element in `a` by `x`, finds the minimum count, and then calculates a specific value based on the sum of `a`, the minimum count, and a subset of `a`. This calculated value is passed to a function `func_2` for each test case. The function does not directly return any value.
