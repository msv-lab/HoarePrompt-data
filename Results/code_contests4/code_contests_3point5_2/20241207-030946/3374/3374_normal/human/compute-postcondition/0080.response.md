According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. Right before the loop, `ai+1` is not divisible by `x`, which means `ai+1 % x != 0`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `ai` must have been divisible by `x`, which implies `ai % x == 0`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, the next element `ai+1` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is set to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ai` is divisible by `x`**
