According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `args` and the current `x` being processed. If there are more elements in `args` to be processed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False, and the next `x` in `args` needs to be processed. So for the loop to execute one more time, `at_start` needs to remain False, and the next `x` to be processed should be the subsequent element in `args`.
State: **`at_start` is False, next `x` in `args` needs to be processed for the loop to execute another time**
