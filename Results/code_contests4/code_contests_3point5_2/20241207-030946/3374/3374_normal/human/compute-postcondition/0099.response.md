According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 0 and `ai` will be the first element in the list `a`. Additionally, `pow_x` should be updated to reflect the new values after each iteration of the loop.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `ai` is the first element in the list `a`**
