Example Answer:
`pow_x` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros. Since `n` is provided as an input integer, the length of `pow_x` is determined by the user input. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged**
