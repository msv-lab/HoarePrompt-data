According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is such that `ai % x == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `ai` needs to be updated by integer division by `x` again.
2. `ai % x` should still be equal to 0 after the update.
3. `cnt` needs to be incremented by 1 again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed, `ai` is such that `ai % x == 0`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ai` has been divided by `x` for the loop to execute again `ai % x == 0, and `ai` has been updated by integer division by `x`.**
