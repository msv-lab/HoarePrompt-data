According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is the first element in `a` divided by `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` needs to be divisible by `x` again. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is as follows:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `func_2` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the next time `ai` is divisible by `x` and `cnt` is increased by 1.**
