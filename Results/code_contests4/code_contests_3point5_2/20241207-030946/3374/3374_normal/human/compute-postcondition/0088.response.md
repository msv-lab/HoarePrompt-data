Example Answer:
`ai` is updated to `ai // x`, where `ai` is divisible by `x`. Therefore, the value of `ai` is now the integer division result of `ai` by `x`. The value of `cnt` is incremented by 4. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with the updated value at index `i` being `ai // x`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 4**
