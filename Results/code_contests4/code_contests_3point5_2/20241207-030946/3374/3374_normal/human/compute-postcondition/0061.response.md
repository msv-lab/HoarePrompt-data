Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is increased by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, so after execution, `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divided by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again `ai` is divisible by `x`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divided by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again `ai` is divisible by `x`**
