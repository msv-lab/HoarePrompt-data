Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated values based on the division by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, `i` is the number of times the loop executed successfully, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` for all elements in `a`, all elements of `a` have been updated after dividing by `x` as many times as possible.**
