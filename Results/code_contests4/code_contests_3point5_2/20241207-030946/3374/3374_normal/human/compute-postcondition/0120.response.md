According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai`. If `ai` is divisible by `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element divisible by `x`, so `ai` is one of those elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `ai` at the end of the previous iteration needs to still be divisible by `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element divisible by `x`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated values based on the division by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, `i` is the number of times the loop executed successfully plus 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `ai` is the updated list of integers after dividing each element by `x` and `ai` at the end of the previous iteration is still divisible by `x`.**
