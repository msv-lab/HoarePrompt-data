Example Answer:
`ai` is updated by performing integer division with `x`, which means `ai` is divided by `x`. Since `ai` is divisible by `x`, the new value of `ai` will be the result of the division. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divisible by `x` and has been updated, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divisible by `x` and has been updated, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
