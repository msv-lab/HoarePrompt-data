According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ai` being divisible by `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` is divided by `x`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` needs to be divisible by `x` again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divided by `x`, and `cnt` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `ai` is divisible by `x`**
