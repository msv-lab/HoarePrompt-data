Example Answer: 
`ai` is assigned the value of `ai` divided by `x`. Since `ai` is an element in list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers, the value of `ai` changes accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with the updated value at index `i`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, the next element `ai+1` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with the updated value at index `i`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, the next element `ai+1` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
