Example Answer:
`cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the next value of `ai` satisfies `ai % x == 0`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the next value of `ai` satisfies `ai % x == 0`**
