According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned**

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Update the loop iteration variable `_` to the next value.
- Modify any necessary variables within the loop body that are used for loop termination conditions or calculations.
- Update any other relevant states based on the modified variables within the loop body.
