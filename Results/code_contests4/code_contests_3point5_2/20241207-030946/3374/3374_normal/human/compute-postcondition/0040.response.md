Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `cnt` is 4, after execution, `cnt` becomes 5. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `i+2` elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed so far, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 5, and `pow_x[i]` is updated with the new value of `cnt`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `i+2` elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed so far, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 5, and `pow_x[i]` is updated with the new value of `cnt`**
