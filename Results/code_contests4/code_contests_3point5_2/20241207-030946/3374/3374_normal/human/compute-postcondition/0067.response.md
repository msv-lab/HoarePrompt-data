According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ai`. If `ai` is divisible by `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ai` is the last element in `a` divided by `x` until it's no longer divisible. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the last element in `a` must be divisible by `x`, so `ai` should be divisible by `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time the last element in `a` must be divisible by `x`, and `cnt` is 0**
