According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` has been updated and is divisible by `x`, and `cnt` has been incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `ai` needs to be divisible by `x` after the update, and `cnt` must be further incremented. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divisible by `x` and has been updated, `cnt` is incremented by 2**
