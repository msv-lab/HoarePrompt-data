Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned.
