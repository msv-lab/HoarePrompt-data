Example Answer:
`min_pow` is assigned the minimum value from the list `pow_x`. The previous values of `pow_x` and other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers where the i-th element represents the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` was divisible by `x` until it's no longer divisible, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged.
