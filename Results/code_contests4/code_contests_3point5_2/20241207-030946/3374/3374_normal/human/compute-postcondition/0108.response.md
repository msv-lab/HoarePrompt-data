Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. As the initial state does not provide the previous value of `cnt`, the new value of `cnt` is 1 more than the previous value. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, the loop executes with `i` as 2, and the next value of `ai` satisfies `ai % x == 0, 'ai' is divided by 'x', `cnt` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, and the next value of `ai` satisfies `ai % x == 0, 'ai' is divided by 'x'**
