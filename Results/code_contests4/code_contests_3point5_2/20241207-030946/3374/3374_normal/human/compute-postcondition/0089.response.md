Output State: **t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with the updated value at index `i` being the final value of `ai`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, all elements of `a` are not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` during each iteration of the loop, i is the length of list `a`**
