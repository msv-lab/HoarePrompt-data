According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` being a positive integer does not guarantee the loop execution, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` having at least one element. Additionally, since the loop uses `enumerate(a)`, the loop will start with `i` as the index of the first element in `a` and `ai` as the first element itself.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the index of the first element in `a` and `ai` is the first element in `a`**
