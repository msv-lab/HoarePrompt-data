Example Answer:
`min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`. The value of `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, which determines the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers representing the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers representing the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`**
