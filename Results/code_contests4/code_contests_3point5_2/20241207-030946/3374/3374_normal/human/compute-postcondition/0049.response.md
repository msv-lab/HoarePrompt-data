Example Answer:
The variables `n` and `x` are assigned input integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is split, converted to integer values, and assigned to `n` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers representing the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` is executed with the calculated value, for the loop to execute one more time `t` must be greater than the current iteration count.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of `n` integers representing the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value in `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` is executed with the calculated value, for the loop to execute one more time `t` must be greater than the current iteration count**
