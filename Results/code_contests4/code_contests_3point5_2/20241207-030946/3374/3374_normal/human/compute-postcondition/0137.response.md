Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` still has elements remaining to iterate through, `pow_x` is updated with the value of `cnt` at index `i`, `min_pow` and `min_idx` remain updated, `func_2` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `cnt` is equal to the total number of times the loop executed, and `ai` is updated to its final value after all the divisions by `x`**
