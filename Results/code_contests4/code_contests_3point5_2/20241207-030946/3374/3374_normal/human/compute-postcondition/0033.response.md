According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ai % x == 0`. Right before the loop, `ai` is not divisible by `x`, so it needs to be adjusted to a value where `ai % x == 0`. Additionally, `cnt` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to a value where `cnt` is incremented after the loop body executes. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `i+2` elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed so far, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 1, and `pow_x[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt`**
