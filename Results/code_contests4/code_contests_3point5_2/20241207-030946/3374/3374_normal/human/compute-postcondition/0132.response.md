Example Answer:
`ai` is updated by performing floor division by `x`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` still has elements remaining to iterate through, `pow_x` is updated, `min_pow` and `min_idx` are updated, `func_2` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1, `pow_x[i]` is assigned a new value, and the new value of `ai` after floor division by `x` satisfies the condition `ai % x == 0` for the loop to execute again, `cnt` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` still has elements remaining to iterate through, `pow_x` is updated, `min_pow` and `min_idx` are updated, `func_2` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1, `pow_x[i]` is assigned a new value, and the new value of `ai` after floor division by `x` satisfies the condition `ai % x == 0` for the loop to execute again, `cnt` is increased by 1**
