Example Answer:
`ai` is updated to the value of `ai` divided by `x`. Since `ai` is the first element in list `a` and `x` is an input integer, the value of `ai` changes based on the input values. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1, `ai % x == 0`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1, `ai % x == 0**
