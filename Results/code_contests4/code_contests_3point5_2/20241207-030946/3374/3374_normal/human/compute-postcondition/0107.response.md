According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed once with `ai` satisfying the condition. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- Increment `i` by 1.
- Increment `cnt` by 1.
- Ensure the next value of `ai` satisfies the condition `ai % x == 0`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute `i` is 2, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the next value of `ai` satisfies `ai % x == 0, 'ai' is divided by 'x`**.
