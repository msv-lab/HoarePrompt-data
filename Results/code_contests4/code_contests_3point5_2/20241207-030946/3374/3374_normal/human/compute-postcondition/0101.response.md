According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ai` and `x`. If `ai` is divisible by `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, `x` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `ai % x == 0` must evaluate to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input with at least 1 element, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ai % x == 0`**
