Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time the last element in `a` must be divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
