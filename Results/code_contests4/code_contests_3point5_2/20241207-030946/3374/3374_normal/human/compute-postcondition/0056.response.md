Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the index of the first element in `a`, `ai` is the first element in `a` divided by `x`, `cnt` is increased by 1**
