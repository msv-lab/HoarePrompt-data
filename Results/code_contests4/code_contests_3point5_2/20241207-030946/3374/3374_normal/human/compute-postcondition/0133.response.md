According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `ai % x == 0` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, the condition is already satisfied, so no adjustments are needed for `ai`. Other states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `cnt` needs to be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` still has elements remaining to iterate through, `pow_x` is updated, `min_pow` and `min_idx` are updated, `func_2` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is increased by 2**
