Example Answer:
The code assigns `min_idx` the index of the minimum value in the list `pow_x`. The values of `min_pow` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers where the i-th element represents the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` was divisible by `x` until it's no longer divisible, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers where the i-th element represents the count of how many times the corresponding element in `a` was divisible by `x` until it's no longer divisible, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged**
