The function `func_2` accepts no parameters. The function is responsible for processing t test cases, each consisting of an integer n representing the length of an array, an integer x representing a value used by a robot, and an array a containing n integers. The function should handle the input constraints stated in the precondition. The function does not return any value explicitly, as it is expected to process the test cases internally without returning any output. 
Functionality: **The function processes t test cases, each consisting of n, x, and an array a, adhering to the input constraints.**
