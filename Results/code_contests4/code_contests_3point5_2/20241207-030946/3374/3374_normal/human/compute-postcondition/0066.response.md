Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers where the i-th element is the count of how many times the last element in `a` was divisible by `x` until it's no longer divisible, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is the last element in `a` divided by `x` until it's no longer divisible, `cnt` is 0**
