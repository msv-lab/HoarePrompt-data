Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned the values from the input after splitting it. The values of `n` and `x` are now updated based on the input. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned**
