According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ai`. If `ai` is divisible by `x`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ai+1` is not divisible by `x`, and `cnt` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ai+1` needs to be divisible by `x`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with the updated value at index `i`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai+1` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 2**
