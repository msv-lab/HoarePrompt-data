Example Answer:
`ai` is updated by integer division by `x`, so its value is modified. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed, `ai` is such that `ai % x == 0`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ai` has been divided by `x` for the loop to execute again `ai % x == 0, and `ai` has been updated by integer division by `x`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed, `ai` is such that `ai % x == 0`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ai` has been divided by `x` for the loop to execute again `ai % x == 0, and `ai` has been updated by integer division by `x`**
