According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. `ai` should remain divisible by `x`.
2. `cnt` should be incremented by 1.
3. `pow_x[i]` should be updated with the new value of `cnt`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `i+2` elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed so far, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is 3, and `pow_x[i]` is updated with the new value of `cnt`, `ai` is divided by `x`.**
