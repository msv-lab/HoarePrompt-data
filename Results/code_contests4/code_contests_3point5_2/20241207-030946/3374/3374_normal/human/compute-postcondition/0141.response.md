Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all elements fully divided by `x`, `pow_x` is a list of integers representing the total number of times each element in `a` was divisible by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, and the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, `min_idx` is assigned the index of the minimum value from `pow_x`.**
