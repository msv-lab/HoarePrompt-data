Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `i+2` elements, `pow_x` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is the total number of times the loop executed so far, `ai` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is the total number of times `ai` was divisible by `x` in the loop, and `pow_x[i]` is assigned the final value of `cnt`.**
