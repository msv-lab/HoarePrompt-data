The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. For each test case, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^9, and `a_i` (1 <= i <= n) are positive integers in the list. The function does not return any value directly, but it performs certain operations based on the input parameters provided for each test case.
