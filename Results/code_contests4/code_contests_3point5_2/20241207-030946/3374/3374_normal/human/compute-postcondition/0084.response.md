Example Answer:
`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with the updated value at index `i`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai+1` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with the updated value at index `i`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i+1`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai+1` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 3**
