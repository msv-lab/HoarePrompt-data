Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element divisible by `x`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated values based on the division by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, `i` is the number of times the loop executed successfully plus 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1.`ai` is the updated list of integers after dividing each element by `x`.
