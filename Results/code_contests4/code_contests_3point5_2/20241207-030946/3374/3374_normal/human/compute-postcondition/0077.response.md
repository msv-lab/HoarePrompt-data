Example Answer:
`pow_x[i]` is assigned the value `cnt`. The value of `cnt` represents the count of how many times the last element in list `a` was divisible by `x` until it's no longer divisible. Therefore, after execution, the value of `pow_x[i]` will be equal to `cnt`. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated value at index `i`, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is not divisible by `x`, `cnt` is the count of how many times the last element in `a` was divisible by `x` until it's no longer divisible**
