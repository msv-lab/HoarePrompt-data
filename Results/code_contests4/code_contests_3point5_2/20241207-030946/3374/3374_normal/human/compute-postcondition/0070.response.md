According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. This means that `ai` must be divisible by `x` for the loop to continue. At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` has been divided by `x`, so to execute the loop one more time, `ai` must still be divisible by `x`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ai` should still be divisible by `x`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element, `pow_x` is a list of integers, `min_pow`, `min_idx`, and `func_2` remain unchanged, `ai` is divisible by `x`, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
