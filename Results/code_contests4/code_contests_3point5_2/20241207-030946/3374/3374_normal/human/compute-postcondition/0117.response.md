According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`, where `ai` is an element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after dividing by `x`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated values based on the division by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, `i` is the number of times the loop executed successfully plus 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one element in the updated list `a` that is divisible by `x`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The list `a` should be updated to include at least one element that is divisible by `x`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element divisible by `x`, `pow_x` is a list of integers with updated values based on the division by `x`, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, `i` is the number of times the loop executed successfully plus 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1**.
