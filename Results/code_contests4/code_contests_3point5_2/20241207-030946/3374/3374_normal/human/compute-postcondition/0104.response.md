According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `ai % x == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop executed once, `i` was increased by 1, and `cnt` was increased by 1. This means `i` is now 1 and `cnt` is now 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `ai` needs to satisfy the condition `ai % x == 0`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input, `pow_x` is a list of integers with all values as 0, `min_pow` is the minimum value from `pow_x`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value in `pow_x`, `func_2` remains unchanged, the result of `func_2(sum(a) * (min_pow + 1) + sum(a[:min_idx]))` is returned, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1, and the next value of `ai` satisfies `ai % x == 0`**
