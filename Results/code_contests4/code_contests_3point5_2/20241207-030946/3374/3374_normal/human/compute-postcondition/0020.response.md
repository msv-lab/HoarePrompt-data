Example Answer: 
The `end` keyword argument is popped from `kwargs` and written to the file. If `end` is not provided, then a newline character '\n' is written. The value of `at_start` remains False as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`at_start` is False**
