**Precondition**: The input consists of t test cases, where each test case has an integer n representing the length of the array and an integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the value used by the robot. The array a contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
