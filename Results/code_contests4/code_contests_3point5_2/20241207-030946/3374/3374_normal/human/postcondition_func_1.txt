The function func_2() processes t test cases, where each case contains an integer n representing the length of an array, an integer x representing a value used by a robot, and an array a. The function prints the values to a stream, separating them by a space, and ending each case with a newline character. If the 'flush' parameter is provided and set to True, the function will flush the output stream. The function accounts for the input constraints specified.
