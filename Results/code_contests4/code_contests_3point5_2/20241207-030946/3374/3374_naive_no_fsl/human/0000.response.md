Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the elements of the array, checks if the current element is divisible by x, and adds x copies of the integer q/x to the end of the array if it is divisible. The sum of all values of the array at the end of the process is calculated as expected. Additionally, the program handles multiple test cases as described in the input format. The implementation seems correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
