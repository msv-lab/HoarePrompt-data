It calculates the maximum number of books that can be read within the time limit K. The function considers the time it takes to read each book on Desk A and Desk B. The function iterates through the books on both desks, adding the reading time until the time limit is reached or all books are read. If the time limit is exceeded, it stops and prints the count of books read up to that point. The functionality includes checking for edge cases such as when one desk runs out of books before the other.
