The function `func_18` accepts three parameters: `a`, `sep`, and `end`. It prints the elements of the list `a` separated by the value of `sep` and with the ending character specified by `end`. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs the printing operation based on the input parameters. However, the code lacks validation checks for the input parameters and does not handle any errors that may occur during the printing process.
