The function func_21 accepts a parameter `s` and attempts to write the string `s` to the standard output. However, the code is incorrect as the `sys` module is not imported, leading to a NameError. Additionally, the `return` statement will not allow the string `s` to be written to the standard output. Therefore, the actual functionality is that the function tries to write the string `s` to the standard output, but due to the missing `sys` import and the inappropriate usage of `return`, it does not achieve this.
