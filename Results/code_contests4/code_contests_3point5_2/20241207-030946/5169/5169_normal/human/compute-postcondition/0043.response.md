Example Answer: 
`totaltime` is incremented by the value of `a[ptr1]`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, and `totaltime` is increased by the value of `a[ptr1]`.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is increased by the value of `a[ptr1]`**
