Example Answer:
`totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`. The previous values of `totaltime`, `ptr1`, and `ptr2` are unknown, so the output state is: `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`, `ptr1` and `ptr2` may have changed.
Output State: **`totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`, `ptr1` and `ptr2` may have changed**
