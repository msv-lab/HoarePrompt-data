Postcondition: ***`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is either 0 or 1, `ptr2` is either 0 or 1, `totaltime` is updated based on the condition, `check` can be either True or False, `count` can be any integer value, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `a` is a list, `a[ptr1]` is not less than `b[ptr2]`. The overall postcondition depends on whether the condition totaltime + b[ptr2] is less than or equal to k or not. If it is, then totaltime is updated accordingly along with the other variables. If not, then check is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
