Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is either incremented by 1 or remains greater than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` can be True or False depending on the conditions met, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime`, loop finished executing and `ptr1` has reached the value of `n`, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` should be less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated by adding the element at index `ptr2` of `b`.
Output State: **`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is either incremented by 1 or remains greater than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` can be True or False depending on the conditions met, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime`, loop finished executing and `ptr1` has reached the value of `n`, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` should be less than `m`, `totaltime` is updated by adding the element at index `ptr2` of `b`, `count` is incremented by 1.**
