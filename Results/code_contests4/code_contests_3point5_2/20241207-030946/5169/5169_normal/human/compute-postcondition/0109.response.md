Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` and `ptr2` are either less than `n` and `m` respectively or equal to `n` and `m` respectively, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` is True if the conditions were met for all iterations or False if not, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime` and it is updated as needed, the loop has finished executing and `ptr1` has reached the value of `n`.***
