Postcondition: ***`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is either incremented by 1 or remains greater than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` can be True or False depending on the conditions met, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime` and it is updated, the loop has finished executing and `ptr1` has reached the value of `n`. If the sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr2` of `b` is less than or equal to `k`, `count` is incremented by 1 and `ptr2` is increased by 1. If the sum of `totaltime` and the element at index `ptr2` of `b` is greater than `k`, `check` is False and `count` is updated.***
