Example Answer:
`ptr2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ptr2` is either greater than or equal to `m`, so after execution, `ptr2` will be greater than or equal to `m`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is greater than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` satisfies the condition, `check` is either True or False, `count` is incremented, loop finished executing, and `ptr1` has reached `n`, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` should be less than `m`.
Output State: **`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is greater than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` satisfies the condition, `check` is either True or False, `count` is incremented, loop finished executing, and `ptr1` has reached `n`, for the loop to execute again `ptr2` should be less than `m`**
