According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`**
