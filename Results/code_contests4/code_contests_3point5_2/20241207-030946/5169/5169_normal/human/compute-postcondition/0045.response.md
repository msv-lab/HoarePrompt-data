Example Answer:
`ptr1` is increased by 1. The previous value of `ptr1` was less than `n`, so after execution, `ptr1` is still less than `n`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is increased by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n`, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is increased by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `count` is incremented by 1**
