Output State: **`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is increased by 1, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` is False, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime` and it is updated, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
