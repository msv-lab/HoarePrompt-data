Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]` and `totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k`, `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr1` of array `a`, `count` is increased by 1, `ptr1` is increased by 1. If `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]` but `totaltime + a[ptr1] > k`, `check` is False and the program breaks. If `a[ptr1] >= b[ptr2]` and `totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k`, `count` is increased by 1 and `ptr2` is increased by an unknown value. If `a[ptr1] >= b[ptr2]` but `totaltime + b[ptr2] > k`, `check` is False and the loop breaks.***
