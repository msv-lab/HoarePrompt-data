Example Answer:
`totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr1` of array `a`. The previous value of `totaltime` is unknown, but the loop will continue as long as `ptr1` is less than `n`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr1` of array `a`, loop continues as long as `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr1` of array `a`, loop continues as long as `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`**
