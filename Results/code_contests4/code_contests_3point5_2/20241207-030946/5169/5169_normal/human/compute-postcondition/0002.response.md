Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value returned by calling the function `func_15()`. The initial state of the program is unknown, so the specific value of `b` depends on the implementation of `func_15()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`.
Output State: **`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`**
