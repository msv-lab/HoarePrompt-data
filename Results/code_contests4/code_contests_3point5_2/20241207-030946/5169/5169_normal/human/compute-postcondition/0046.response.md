Example Answer:
The variable `check` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `ptr1` and `ptr2`, which are less than `n` and `m` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`, `check` is False.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`, `check` is False**
