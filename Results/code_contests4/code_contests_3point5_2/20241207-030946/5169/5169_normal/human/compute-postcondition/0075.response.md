Postcondition: ***`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is either increased by 2 or 1 based on the condition met, `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` can be True or False depending on the conditions met, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime` and it is updated. If the condition is met, `totaltime` is increased by the value of `a` at index `ptr1` and `count` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `check` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
