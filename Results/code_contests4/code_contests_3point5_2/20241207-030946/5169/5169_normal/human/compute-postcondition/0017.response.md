Postcondition: ***`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` and `ptr2` are indices of `a` and `b` respectively. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, `ptr1` is 1, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is increased by the value at index `ptr1` of `a`, `check` is True, `count` is increased by 1. If totaltime + a[ptr1] is greater than k, `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is False, `count` is 0. `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `a` is a list. The value at index `ptr1` of `a` is less than the value at index `ptr2` of `b`.***
