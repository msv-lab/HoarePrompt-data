Example Answer: 
The value of `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`. The states of `ptr1` and `ptr2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`.
Output State: **`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`, `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`**
