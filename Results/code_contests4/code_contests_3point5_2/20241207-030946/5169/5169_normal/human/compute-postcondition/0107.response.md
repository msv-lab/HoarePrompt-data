Output State: **`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is equal to `m`, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` is True if the conditions were met for all iterations, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime` and it is updated, the loop has finished executing and `ptr1` has reached the value of `n`.**
