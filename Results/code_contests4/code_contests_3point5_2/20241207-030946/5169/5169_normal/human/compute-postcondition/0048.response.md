Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, then totaltime is increased by the value of a[ptr1] and count is incremented by 1. If totaltime + a[ptr1] > k, then check is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
