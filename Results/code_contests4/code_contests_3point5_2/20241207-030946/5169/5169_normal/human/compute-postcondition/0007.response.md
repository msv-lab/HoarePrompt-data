Example Answer:
`count` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the affected variables are: `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is True. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is True, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is True, `count` is 0**
