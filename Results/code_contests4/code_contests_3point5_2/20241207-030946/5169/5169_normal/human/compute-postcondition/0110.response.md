The function `func_22` accepts integers N, M, K, A_i, and B_i as parameters. N represents the number of books on Desk A, M represents the number of books on Desk B, K represents the total time limit in minutes, A_i represents the time in minutes to read the i-th book on Desk A, and B_i represents the time in minutes to read the i-th book on Desk B. After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum number of books that can be read within the time limit K while considering the time it takes to read each book on both desks. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_22 is to accept the number of books on each desk, the time limit, and the time to read each book, and return the maximum number of books that can be read within the time limit.
