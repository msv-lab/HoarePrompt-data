Postcondition: ***`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is equal to `n`, `ptr2` is incremented to be greater than or equal to `m`, `totaltime` is such that the sum of elements in `a` and `b` within the limits of `ptr1` and `ptr2` respectively is less than or equal to `k`, `check` can be True or False depending on the conditions met, `count` is the total number of elements added to `totaltime` and it is updated. The loop has finished executing and `ptr1` has reached the value of `n`. Additionally, the sum of totaltime and the element at ptr2 in b is greater than k.***
