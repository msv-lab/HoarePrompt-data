Postcondition: ***`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` and `ptr2` are indices of `a` and `b` respectively. If totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k, `ptr1` is 1, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is increased by the value at index `ptr1` of `a`, `check` is True, `count` is increased by 1. If totaltime + a[ptr1] is greater than k, `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is False, `count` is 0. If a[ptr1] < b[ptr2], then the above conditions are executed. If a[ptr1] is not less than b[ptr2], `ptr1` is either 0 or 1, `ptr2` is either 0 or 1, totaltime is updated based on the condition, check can be either True or False, count can be any integer value. Depending on whether totaltime + b[ptr2] is less than or equal to k, the postcondition varies. If true, totaltime is updated along with the other variables. If false, check is set to False, and the loop or if statement breaks.***
