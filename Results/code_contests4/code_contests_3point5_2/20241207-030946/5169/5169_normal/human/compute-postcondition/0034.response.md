Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `totaltime + a[ptr1]` is less than or equal to `k`, `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr1` of array `a`, loop continues, `count` is increased by 1, `ptr1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `check` is False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
