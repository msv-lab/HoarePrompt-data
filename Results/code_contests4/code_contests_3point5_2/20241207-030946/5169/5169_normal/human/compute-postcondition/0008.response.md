According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ptr1`, `n`, `ptr2`, and `m`. If `ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0. This means `n` and `m` determine the execution of the loop. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`b` is assigned the value returned by `func_15()`, `ptr1` is 0, `ptr2` is 0, `totaltime` is 0, `check` is True, `count` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` and `m` must be greater than 0**
