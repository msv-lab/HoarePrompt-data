Postcondition: ***`ptr1` is less than `n` and `ptr2` is less than `m`. If `a[ptr1] < b[ptr2]` and `totaltime + a[ptr1] <= k`, then `totaltime` is increased by the value of `a[ptr1]`, `count` is incremented by 1. If `totaltime + a[ptr1] > k`, then `check` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[ptr1] >= b[ptr2]` and `totaltime + b[ptr2] <= k`, then `totaltime` is incremented by the value at index `ptr2` of list `b`, `count` is increased by 1, and `ptr2` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `check` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
