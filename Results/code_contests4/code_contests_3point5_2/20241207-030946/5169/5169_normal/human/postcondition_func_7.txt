The function `func_8` accepts three parameters `d`, `x`, and `default`. It iterates through the list `d` to find the first and last occurrences of the element `x`. If `x` is not found in the list, it returns the default value twice. If `x` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` as the first value in the tuple and the index of the last occurrence of `x` as the second value in the tuple.
