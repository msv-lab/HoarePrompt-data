The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `start`, both of which are positive integers. It then calculates and returns a list containing all the divisors of the positive integer `n`. The function iterates through the range from `start` to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checks for divisors, and appends them to the `divisors` list. If a divisor is found, both the divisor and its pair are added to the list. The function correctly computes the divisors of `n` up to the square root.
