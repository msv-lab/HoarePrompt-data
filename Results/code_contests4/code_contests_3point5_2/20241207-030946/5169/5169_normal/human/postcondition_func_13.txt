The function `func_14` does not accept any parameters. It returns a map object containing integers converted from the result of calling `func_12()` and splitting the output. The functionality of the function is to perform the conversion and return the integers in a map object. However, the annotations mention specific constraints on N, M, K, A_i, and B_i without utilizing them in the function. Therefore, the function may not fully adhere to the annotated constraints.
