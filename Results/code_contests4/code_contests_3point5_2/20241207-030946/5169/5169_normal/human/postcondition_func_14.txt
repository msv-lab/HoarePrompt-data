The function func_15 does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the output of the function func_12() and converting each element to an integer. The function relies on the precondition that N and M are integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B, K is an integer representing the total minutes allowed to read the books, and A_i and B_i are integers representing the time in minutes to read the i-th book on Desk A and Desk B.
