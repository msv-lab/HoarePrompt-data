The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `primes`. It iterates over the elements in `primes`, updating `divs_number` based on the divisors of `n`. 

Potential Cases:
- Case 1: If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- Case 2: For each element `i` in `primes`, it calculates the power of `i` in the prime factorization of `n` and updates `divs_number`.
- Case 3: The function returns the final value of `divs_number` after all iterations.

The actual code might differ from the annotations provided due to missing details in the annotations, so it is essential to focus on the code itself to understand the function's behavior.
