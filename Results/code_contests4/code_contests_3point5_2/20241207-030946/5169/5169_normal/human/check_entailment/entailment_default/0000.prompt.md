You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B similarly has M books on it.

It takes us A_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk A (1 \leq i \leq N), and B_i minutes to read the i-th book from the top on Desk B (1 \leq i \leq M).

Consider the following action:

* Choose a desk with a book remaining, read the topmost book on that desk, and remove it from the desk.



How many books can we read at most by repeating this action so that it takes us at most K minutes in total? We ignore the time it takes to do anything other than reading.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 200000
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M K

 Output decription for function1:  The function `func_1` takes a positive integer parameter `mod` and calculates factorials modulo `mod` for a list of positive integers `A_i` and `B_i`, where 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= i <= M respectively. It then returns two lists: `fact` containing factorials modulo `mod` for `A_i` and `B_i`, and `ifact` with updated values based on a specific formula. The code initializes and populates the `fact` list with factorials modulo `mod`, and then updates the `ifact` list based on the provided formula.

''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` calculates and returns a list of prime numbers up to the input parameter `n`, where `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 200000. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it generates a list containing all prime numbers from 2 up to `n`, where `n` is the largest odd integer less than or equal to `n`.

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `start`, both of which are positive integers. It then calculates and returns a list containing all the divisors of the positive integer `n`. The function iterates through the range from `start` to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checks for divisors, and appends them to the `divisors` list. If a divisor is found, both the divisor and its pair are added to the list. The function correctly computes the divisors of `n` up to the square root.
Function number 7 :

 Output decription for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `primes`. It iterates over the elements in `primes`, updating `divs_number` based on the divisors of `n`. 

Potential Cases:
- Case 1: If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- Case 2: For each element `i` in `primes`, it calculates the power of `i` in the prime factorization of `n` and updates `divs_number`.
- Case 3: The function returns the final value of `divs_number` after all iterations.

The actual code might differ from the annotations provided due to missing details in the annotations, so it is essential to focus on the code itself to understand the function's behavior.
Function number 8 :
 Code:

It updates the values of `x` and `y` iteratively until `y` becomes False, indicating the loop completion. The final result returned is the updated value of `x`. The function accepts two integer parameters representing the number of books on desk A and desk B, respectively.
Function number 10 :
 Code:

 Output decription for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a list `a` containing positive integers representing the time in minutes to read each book on Desk A and Desk B. The function iterates through the list and returns False if any element is greater than the element next to it; otherwise, it returns True. The function accurately handles the postconditions mentioned in the annotations.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n, k=1):
    return n // k + (n % k != 0)
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. It then calculates the integer division of n by k, and if there is a remainder, it adds 1 to the result. The function returns this calculated value.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input and returns the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The input is expected to consist of positive integers N, M, K, A_i, and B_i.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    return int(func_12())
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function `func_12()`, the program returns the integer value obtained from `func_12()`. The function solely acts as a wrapper to call `func_12()` and return its result as an integer.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    return map(int, func_12().split())
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function `func_14` does not accept any parameters. It returns a map object containing integers converted from the result of calling `func_12()` and splitting the output. The functionality of the function is to perform the conversion and return the integers in a map object. However, the annotations mention specific constraints on N, M, K, A_i, and B_i without utilizing them in the function. Therefore, the function may not fully adhere to the annotated constraints.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    return list(map(int, func_12().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function func_15 does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the output of the function func_12() and converting each element to an integer. The function relies on the precondition that N and M are integers representing the number of books on Desk A and Desk B, K is an integer representing the total minutes allowed to read the books, and A_i and B_i are integers representing the time in minutes to read the i-th book on Desk A and Desk B.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    return func_12().split()
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function func_16 does not accept any parameters. It internally calls func_12 and returns the output split into a list. The function's purpose is to split the output of func_12 into a list. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the output of func_12 is not a string.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // func_9(a, b)
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  The function `func_17` accepts two variables 'a' and 'b', calculates the absolute value of their multiplication result, and then divides it by the result of the function `func_9(a, b)`.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18(a, sep=' ', end='\n'):
    print(sep.join(map(str, a)), end=end)
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function `func_18` accepts three parameters: `a`, `sep`, and `end`. It prints the elements of the list `a` separated by the value of `sep` and with the ending character specified by `end`. The function does not explicitly return any value but performs the printing operation based on the input parameters. However, the code lacks validation checks for the input parameters and does not handle any errors that may occur during the printing process.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    return defaultdict(int)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function func_19 does not accept any parameters and returns a defaultdict with a default value set to 0. It initializes and returns an empty defaultdict with the default value of 0. The annotations state that N, M, and K have specific ranges and A_i, B_i have specific ranges, but these parameters are not utilized within the function.
Function number 20 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_20():
    return defaultdict(list)
''' 

 Output decription for function20:  The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses positive integers N, M, and K, as well as positive integers A_i and B_i for 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= i <= M. The function returns a defaultdict with empty lists as values.
Function number 21 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_21(s):
    return sys.stdout.write(s)
''' 

 Output decription for function21:  The function func_21 accepts a parameter `s` and attempts to write the string `s` to the standard output. However, the code is incorrect as the `sys` module is not imported, leading to a NameError. Additionally, the `return` statement will not allow the string `s` to be written to the standard output. Therefore, the actual functionality is that the function tries to write the string `s` to the standard output, but due to the missing `sys` import and the inappropriate usage of `return`, it does not achieve this.
Function number 22 :
 Code:
 '''

The function considers the time it takes to read each book on Desk A and Desk B. The function iterates through the books on both desks, adding the reading time until the time limit is reached or all books are read. If the time limit is exceeded, it stops and prints the count of books read up to that point. The functionality includes checking for edge cases such as when one desk runs out of books before the other.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
