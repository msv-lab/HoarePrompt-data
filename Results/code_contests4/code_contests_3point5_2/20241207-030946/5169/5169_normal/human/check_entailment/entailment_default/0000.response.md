Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of books that can be read within the given time limit by iterating through the books on Desk A and Desk B.
- The code handles cases where one desk runs out of books before the other and checks if the time limit is exceeded.
- The functions provided seem to be supporting the main calculation in func_22 by providing factorial and inverse factorial calculations, finding the maximum value for a given sum, calculating divisors, finding prime numbers, calculating the greatest common divisor, and handling input/output operations.
- The output hints also align with the code logic, providing additional information about the functions used in the main program.
- Considering all the information provided, there are no apparent edge cases or discrepancies between the code, the problem description, and the output hints. Hence, the correctness of the program is evaluated as True.
