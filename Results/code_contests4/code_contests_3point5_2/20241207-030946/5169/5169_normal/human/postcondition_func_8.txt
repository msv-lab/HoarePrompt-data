The function `func_9` calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `x` and `y`. It updates the values of `x` and `y` iteratively until `y` becomes False, indicating the loop completion. The final result returned is the updated value of `x`. The function accepts two integer parameters representing the number of books on desk A and desk B, respectively.
