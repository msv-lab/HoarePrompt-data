Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for N, M, K, A, and B. It then iterates through the books on both desks A and B, choosing the book with the minimum time to read until the total time spent reading exceeds K. The program keeps track of the total time spent reading and the count of books read. Finally, it prints the maximum number of books that can be read within the given time limit K.

The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately. There don't seem to be any scenarios where the program would not work as expected.
