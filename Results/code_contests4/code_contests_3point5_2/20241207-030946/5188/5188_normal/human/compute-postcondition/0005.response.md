Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b. If a is greater than b, it returns the result of subtracting b from a. If b is greater than or equal to a, it returns the result of subtracting a from b. **

The code accurately follows the annotations provided. However, it does not cover the scenario where a is equal to b. In that case, the function would return 0, which is missing from the annotations.
