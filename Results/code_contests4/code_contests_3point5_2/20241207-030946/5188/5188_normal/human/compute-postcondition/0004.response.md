The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are integers.

Case 1: If `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns the result of subtracting `b` from `a`.

Case 2: If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, the function returns the difference between `b` and `a`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return the result of the subtraction operation based on the relationship between the two parameters. If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns the result of `a - b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `a`, it returns the result of `b - a`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters a and b. If a is greater than b, it returns a - b. If b is greater than or equal to a, it returns b - a.**
