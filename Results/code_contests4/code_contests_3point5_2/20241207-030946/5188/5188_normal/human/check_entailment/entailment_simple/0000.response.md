Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not relate to the problem description at all. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and simply returns the absolute difference between the two parameters. This has no connection to the Sirtet game or the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
