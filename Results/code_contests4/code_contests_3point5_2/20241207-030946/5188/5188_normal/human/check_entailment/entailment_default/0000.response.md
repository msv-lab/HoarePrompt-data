Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the number of initial grids that satisfy the requirements and can reach the goal using the given operations. The code uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and returns the desired answer modulo 998,244,353. The code also seems to be handling all edge cases and follows the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness.
