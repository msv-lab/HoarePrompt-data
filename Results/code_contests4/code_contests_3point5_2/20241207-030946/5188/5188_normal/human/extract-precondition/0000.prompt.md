You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Alice has got addicted to a game called Sirtet recently.

In Sirtet, player is given an n × m grid. Initially a_{i,j} cubes are stacked up in the cell (i,j). Two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Player can perform the following operations: 

  * stack up one cube in two adjacent cells; 
  * stack up two cubes in one cell. 



Cubes mentioned above are identical in height.

Here is an illustration of the game. States on the right are obtained by performing one of the above operations on the state on the left, and grey cubes are added due to the operation.

<image>

Player's goal is to make the height of all cells the same (i.e. so that each cell has the same number of cubes in it) using above operations. 

Alice, however, has found out that on some starting grids she may never reach the goal no matter what strategy she uses. Thus, she is wondering the number of initial grids such that 

  * L ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ R for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m; 
  * player can reach the goal using above operations. 



Please help Alice with it. Notice that the answer might be large, please output the desired value modulo 998,244,353.

Input

The only line contains four integers n, m, L and R (1≤ n,m,L,R ≤ 10^9, L ≤ R, n ⋅ m ≥ 2).

Output

Output one integer, representing the desired answer modulo 998,244,353.

Examples

Input


2 2 1 1


Output


1


Input


1 2 1 2


Output


2

Note

In the first sample, the only initial grid that satisfies the requirements is a_{1,1}=a_{2,1}=a_{1,2}=a_{2,2}=1. Thus the answer should be 1.

In the second sample, initial grids that satisfy the requirements are a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=1 and a_{1,1}=a_{1,2}=2. Thus the answer should be 2.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(a, b):
```
