Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the desired answer modulo 998,244,353 for all potential cases. The issue lies in the calculation of `o` and `e` based on the values of `l` and `r`. The logic used to determine whether `o` and `e` values should be adjusted is incorrect and may lead to incorrect results. 

To illustrate this, consider the input `(1, 2, 1, 2)`. According to the problem description, the correct output should be `2`. However, the program may not produce the correct result for this input due to the flawed logic in calculating `o` and `e`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential cases.
