Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the calculation of the variables `o` and `e` based on the conditions for odd and even values of `l` and `r`. The calculations for `o` and `e` are incorrect and do not align with the problem requirements.

To demonstrate the incorrect behavior, consider the input:
```
2 2 1 1
```
For this input, the correct output should be `1` as there is only one initial grid that satisfies the requirements. However, the program provided outputs a different result due to the incorrect calculations for `o` and `e`.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness of the program false.
