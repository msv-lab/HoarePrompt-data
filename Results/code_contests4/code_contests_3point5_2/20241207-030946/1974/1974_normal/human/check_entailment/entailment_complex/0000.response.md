Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the rearrangement of statues can be done in the existing network. It reads the input values, rotates the second list of statues based on a specific condition, and then checks if the rotated list matches the original list. If they match, it prints "YES", indicating that the rearrangement can be done. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program follows the problem description as it handles the rotation of statues and checks if the rearrangement is possible. It considers all the constraints mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
