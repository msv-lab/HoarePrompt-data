Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input, removes the 0 values from the lists of current statues and desired statues, rotates the list of desired statues to match the starting point of the current statues list, and then checks if the rotated list matches the original list. If they match, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

This approach works correctly for all cases as it follows the rules described in the problem description. The rotation of the list ensures that the islanders can move the statues in the desired order by starting from the island with the empty pedestal and moving the statues accordingly.
