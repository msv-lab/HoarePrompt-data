Example Answer:
The code snippet replaces any occurrence of ' 0 ' with a single space in the string `f`. The variables `n`, `ai`, and `bi` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island**
