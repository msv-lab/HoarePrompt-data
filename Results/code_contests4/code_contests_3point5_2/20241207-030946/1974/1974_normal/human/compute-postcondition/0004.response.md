Example Answer:
The code replaces any occurrence of ' 0 ' in the string `s` with a single space ' '. This operation modifies the `s` variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island, `s` is a string with spaces at the beginning and end but with ' 0 ' replaced by a single space.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island, `s` is a string with spaces at the beginning and end but with ' 0 ' replaced by a single space**
