Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints 'NO' and does not affect any of the variables or data structures in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island, `s` is a rotated version of the original string, `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in the rotated `s` or -1 if `ff` is not found. The string `s` is not equal to `f`**
