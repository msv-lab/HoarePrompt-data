Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by two lists of integers `f` and `s`. It then modifies `s` by rotating it based on certain conditions. After that, it compares the modified `s` with `f` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and works with predefined constraints. The output of the function is not provided.**
