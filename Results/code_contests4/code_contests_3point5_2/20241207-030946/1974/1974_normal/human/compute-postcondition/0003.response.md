Example Answer:
The input string is read using `raw_input()` and then concatenated with spaces at the beginning and end. The resulting string is assigned to variable `s`. The initial state is `n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island, `s` is a string with spaces at the beginning and end.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island, `s` is a string with spaces at the beginning and end**
