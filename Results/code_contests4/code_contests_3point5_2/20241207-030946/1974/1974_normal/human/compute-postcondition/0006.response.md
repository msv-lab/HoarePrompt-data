Example Answer:
`ss` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in the string `s`. If `ff` is not found in `s`, then `ss` will be -1. The variables `n`, `ai`, `bi` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island, `s` is a string with spaces at the beginning and end but with ' 0 ' replaced by a single space, `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s` or -1 if `ff` is not found.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island, `s` is a string with spaces at the beginning and end but with ' 0 ' replaced by a single space, `ss` is the index of the first occurrence of `ff` in `s` or -1 if `ff` is not found**
