Example Answer:
`f` is assigned the value of a string that contains a space, the input value, and another space. The input is read as a string. The other variables `n`, `ai`, and `bi` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers representing the statues currently placed and desired statues on each island**
