Correctness: False

The given program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. One such case is when there are statues on all islands except one, and the desired order requires moving a statue from the island with an empty pedestal to another island. In this case, the program will not output the correct result. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 0
0 3 2 1
```
The correct output should be "NO" because it is not possible to rearrange the statues in the desired order. However, the program will output "YES" because it does not consider this specific case. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness should be False.
