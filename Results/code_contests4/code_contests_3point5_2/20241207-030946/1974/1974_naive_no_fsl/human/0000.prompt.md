You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A remote island chain contains n islands, labeled 1 through n. Bidirectional bridges connect the islands to form a simple cycle — a bridge connects islands 1 and 2, islands 2 and 3, and so on, and additionally a bridge connects islands n and 1. The center of each island contains an identical pedestal, and all but one of the islands has a fragile, uniquely colored statue currently held on the pedestal. The remaining island holds only an empty pedestal.

The islanders want to rearrange the statues in a new order. To do this, they repeat the following process: First, they choose an island directly adjacent to the island containing an empty pedestal. Then, they painstakingly carry the statue on this island across the adjoining bridge and place it on the empty pedestal.

Determine if it is possible for the islanders to arrange the statues in the desired order.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the total number of islands.

The second line contains n space-separated integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1) — the statue currently placed on the i-th island. If ai = 0, then the island has no statue. It is guaranteed that the ai are distinct.

The third line contains n space-separated integers bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ n - 1) — the desired statues of the ith island. Once again, bi = 0 indicates the island desires no statue. It is guaranteed that the bi are distinct.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if the rearrangement can be done in the existing network, and "NO" otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
1 0 2
2 0 1


Output

YES


Input

2
1 0
0 1


Output

YES


Input

4
1 2 3 0
0 3 2 1


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the islanders can first move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2, then move statue 2 from island 3 to island 1, and finally move statue 1 from island 2 to island 3.

In the second sample, the islanders can simply move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2.

In the third sample, no sequence of movements results in the desired position.
Program:
```
n = input()
f = ' ' + raw_input() + ' '
f = f.replace(' 0 ', ' ')
s = ' ' + raw_input() + ' '
s = s.replace(' 0 ', ' ')
ff = f[1]
ss = s.find(ff)
s = ' ' + s[ss:-1] + s[:ss]
if s == f:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
