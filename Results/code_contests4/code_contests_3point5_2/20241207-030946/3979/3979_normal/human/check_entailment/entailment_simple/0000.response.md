Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not address the problem description given. The program is supposed to find the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit on the way from (x1; y1) to (x2; y2) based on certain conditions. However, the annotated program is a simple division function that does not consider the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not do what the problem description asks for in any potential case.
