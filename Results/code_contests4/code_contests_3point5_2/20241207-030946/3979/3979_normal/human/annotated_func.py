#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(c, d):
    if (c >= 0) :
        return c / d
        #The program returns the result of dividing the integer c by the variable d
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: c is an integer. c is less than 0.
    return c / d
    #The program returns the result of dividing integer c by variable d
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `c` and `d`. `c` is an integer and `d` is a variable. The function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d` in both cases where `c` is greater than or equal to 0. However, the code does not handle the case where `d` is 0, which could potentially lead to a division by zero error. This missing functionality should be considered in the summary.
