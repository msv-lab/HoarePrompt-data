Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `c` and `d`. `c` is an integer and `d` is a variable. The function returns the result of dividing `c` by `d` in both cases where `c` is greater than or equal to 0. However, the code does not handle the case where `d` is 0, which could potentially lead to a division by zero error. This missing functionality should be considered in the summary. **
