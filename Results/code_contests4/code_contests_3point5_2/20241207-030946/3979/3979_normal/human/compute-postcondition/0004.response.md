The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `c` and `d`. `c` is an integer and `d` is a variable. The program has two cases:
1. Case 1: The program returns the result of dividing the integer `c` by the variable `d`.
2. Case 2: The program returns the result of dividing integer `c` by variable `d`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `c` and a variable `d`, and return the result of dividing `c` by `d` in both cases.
