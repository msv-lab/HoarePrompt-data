Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit in order to travel from square (x1; y1) to square (x2; y2) based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The function `func_1` handles the calculation of the required values, and the final result is obtained by taking the maximum of the two calculated values. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
