You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an infinite checkered field. You should get from a square (x1; y1) to a square (x2; y2). Using the shortest path is not necessary. You can move on the field squares in four directions. That is, when you are positioned in any square, you can move to any other side-neighboring one. 

A square (x; y) is considered bad, if at least one of the two conditions is fulfilled:

  * |x + y| ≡ 0 (mod 2a),
  * |x - y| ≡ 0 (mod 2b).



Your task is to find the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit on the way from (x1; y1) to (x2; y2).

Input

The only line contains integers a, b, x1, y1, x2 and y2 — the parameters of the bad squares, the coordinates of the initial and the final squares correspondingly (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 109 and |x1|,|y1|,|x2|,|y2| ≤ 109). It is guaranteed that the initial and the final square aren't bad.

Output

Print a single number — the minimum number of bad cells that one will have to visit in order to travel from square (x1; y1) to square (x2; y2).

Examples

Note

In the third sample one of the possible paths in (3;-1)->(3;0)->(3;1)->(3;2)->(4;2)->(4;3)->(4;4)->(4;5)->(4;6)->(4;7)->(3;7). Squares (3;1) and (4;4) are bad.
Program:
```
(a, b, x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, raw_input().split())

def func_1(c, d):
    if c >= 0:
        return c / d
    return c / d
aa = func_1(x1 + y1, 2 * a)
aaa = func_1(x2 + y2, 2 * a)
ans1 = abs(aaa - aa)
bb = func_1(x1 - y1, 2 * b)
bbb = func_1(x2 - y2, 2 * b)
ans2 = abs(bbb - bb)
print(max(ans1, ans2))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
