Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of bad cells one will have to visit in order to travel from square (x1; y1) to square (x2; y2). 

For example, if we take the input:
2 2 5 1 7 4

The expected output should be 2, as one of the possible paths is (5;1) -> (5;2) -> (5;3) -> (6;3) -> (7;4). The bad squares are (5;3) and (6;4), so the minimum number of bad cells visited is 2. However, the given program will output 1, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
