Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy to one of the corner cells of the chessboard based on the given conditions. It iterates through all four corner cells and checks if it is possible to reach that corner cell using the given rules. If it is possible, it calculates the minimum number of moves required and updates the minimum value. Finally, it outputs the minimum number of moves needed or "Poor Inna and pony!" if it is not possible to reach any corner cell. The program handles all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
