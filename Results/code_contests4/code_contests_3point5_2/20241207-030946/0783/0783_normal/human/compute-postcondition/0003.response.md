Example Answer:
`dx` is assigned the absolute difference between the value of `x` and the first element of list `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, `y`, `a`, `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`**
