According to the code, the loop can execute for each tuple in the list. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged if 0 == dx + dy or if dx % a == 0 and dy % b == 0 and (dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2). 

For the loop to execute one more time, the values that need to be adjusted are:
- If 0 != dx + dy and dx % a != 0 or dy % b != 0 or (dx / a % 2 != dy / b % 2), then the loop will execute again.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged if 0 == dx + dy. Otherwise, if dx % a == 0 and dy % b == 0 and (dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2), `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged.**
