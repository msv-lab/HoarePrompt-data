Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, and `v` remain unchanged. If `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the quotient of `dx` divided by `a` has the same parity as the quotient of `dy` divided by `b`, then no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `v` is assigned the value 0.***
