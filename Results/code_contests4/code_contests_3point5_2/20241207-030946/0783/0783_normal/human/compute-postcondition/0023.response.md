Example Answer:
`v` is assigned the minimum value between `v` and the maximum value of `dx / a` and `dy / b`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `a`, and `b` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact calculation cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, and `v` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, and `v` remain unchanged**
