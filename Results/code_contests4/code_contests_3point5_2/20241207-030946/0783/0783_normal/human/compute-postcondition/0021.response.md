Example Answer:
The variable `dy` is assigned the absolute difference between the current value of `y` and the second element of list `c`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, and `v` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, and `v` remain unchanged**
