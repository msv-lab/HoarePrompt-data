Example Answer:
The absolute difference between the value of `y` and the second element of list `c` is calculated and assigned to `dy`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged**
