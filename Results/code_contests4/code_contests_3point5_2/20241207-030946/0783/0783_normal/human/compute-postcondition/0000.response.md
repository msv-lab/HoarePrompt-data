Example Answer:
n, m, x, y, a, b are assigned values based on the input received from raw_input(). Since the values are integers between 1 and 10^6, the variables will hold integer values within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, x, y, a, b are integers between 1 and 10^6.
Output State: **n, m, x, y, a, b are integers between 1 and 10^6.**
