Example Answer:
`dx` is assigned the absolute difference between the value of `x` and the first element of the list `c`. The values of `x` and `c[0]` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx`, `dy`, and `v` remain unchanged**
