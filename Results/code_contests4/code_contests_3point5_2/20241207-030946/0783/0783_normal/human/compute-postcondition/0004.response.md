Example Answer:
`dy` is assigned the absolute difference between the value of `y` and `c[1]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `dx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`, `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and `c[1]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6, `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`, `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and `c[1]`**
