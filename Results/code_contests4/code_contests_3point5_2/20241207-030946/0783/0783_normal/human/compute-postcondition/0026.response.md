Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `v` remain unchanged. If `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the quotient of `dx` divided by `a` has the same parity as the quotient of `dy` divided by `b`, then no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `v` remains the same as the minimum value of the current `v` and the maximum value of the quotients `dx / a` and `dy / b`.**
