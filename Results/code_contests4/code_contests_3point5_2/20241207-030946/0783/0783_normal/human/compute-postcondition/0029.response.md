Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged. If `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the quotient of `dx` divided by `a` has the same parity as the quotient of `dy` divided by `b`, then no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `v` remains the same as the minimum value of the current `v` and the maximum value of the quotients `dx / a` and `dy / b`. If `v` and the maximum of the absolute differences between `n` and `x`, `m` and `y` with `a` and `b` respectively is less than `a` and `b` respectively, then `v` retains the minimum value of the current `v` and the maximum of the quotients `dx / a` and `dy / b`.***
