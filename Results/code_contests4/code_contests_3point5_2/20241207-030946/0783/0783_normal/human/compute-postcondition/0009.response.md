Example Answer:
`v` is assigned the minimum value between `v` and the maximum value of `dx / a` and `dy / b`. Since `dx` and `dy` are the absolute differences between `x` and `c[0]` and `y` and `c[1]` respectively, and `a` and `b` are also integers, the output `v` will be the minimum value between the integer division results of `dx / a` and `dy / b`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6. `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`, `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and `c[1]`. The sum of `dx` and `dy` is not equal to 0. The condition (dx % a == 0 and dy % b == 0 and (dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2)) is satisfied, and `v` is updated accordingly.
