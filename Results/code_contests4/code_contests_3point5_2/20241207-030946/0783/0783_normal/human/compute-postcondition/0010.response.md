Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6. `dx` is the absolute difference between `x` and `c[0]`, `dy` is the absolute difference between `y` and `c[1]`. The sum of `dx` and `dy` is not equal to 0. If dx % a == 0, dy % b == 0, and (dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2) are satisfied, `v` is updated accordingly.***
