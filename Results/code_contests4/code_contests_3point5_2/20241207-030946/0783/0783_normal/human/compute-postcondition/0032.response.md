Functionality: **The function `func` reads input integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` and calculates a value `v` based on certain conditions involving these input values. It iterates through different coordinate pairs, calculates distances, and updates the value of `v` accordingly. At the end, it checks `v` against certain conditions and prints a message based on the value of `v`. The function does not have a return value.**
