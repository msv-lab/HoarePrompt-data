Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy to one of the corners of the chessboard based on the given conditions. The code iterates through different coordinate pairs, calculates distances, and updates the value of `v` accordingly. It also correctly checks the conditions for the candy to reach one of the corners and prints the output accordingly. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for all valid inputs.
