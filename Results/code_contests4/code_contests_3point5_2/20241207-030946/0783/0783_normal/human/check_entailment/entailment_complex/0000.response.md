Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads input integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` and calculates a value `v` based on the conditions specified in the problem. It iterates through different coordinate pairs, calculates distances, and updates the value of `v` accordingly. At the end, it checks `v` against certain conditions and prints the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy to one of the corners of the chessboard.

The program handles all the conditions mentioned in the problem description, such as moving the candy within the chessboard borders and calculating the minimum number of moves needed. It also correctly outputs "Poor Inna and pony!" when the candy cannot reach any of the corners of the chessboard.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
