You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Dima and Inna are doing so great! At the moment, Inna is sitting on the magic lawn playing with a pink pony. Dima wanted to play too. He brought an n × m chessboard, a very tasty candy and two numbers a and b.

Dima put the chessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (i, j) on the board. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner cells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of the following types:

  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y - b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y - b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x - a, y + b); 
  * move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to position (x + a, y + b). 



Naturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy beyond the chessboard borders.

Inna and the pony started shifting the candy around the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions that they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (i, j) to one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task! 

Input

The first line of the input contains six integers n, m, i, j, a, b (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 106; 1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ j ≤ m; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

You can assume that the chessboard rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Position (i, j) in the statement is a chessboard cell on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. You can consider that the corners are: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1).

Output

In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to get the candy.

If Inna and the pony cannot get the candy playing by Dima's rules, print on a single line "Poor Inna and pony!" without the quotes.

Examples

Input

5 7 1 3 2 2


Output

2


Input

5 5 2 3 1 1


Output

Poor Inna and pony!

Note

Note to sample 1:

Inna and the pony can move the candy to position (1 + 2, 3 + 2) = (3, 5), from there they can move it to positions (3 - 2, 5 + 2) = (1, 7) and (3 + 2, 5 + 2) = (5, 7). These positions correspond to the corner squares of the chess board. Thus, the answer to the test sample equals two.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, i, j, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m, i, j, a, b <= 10^6.**
def func():
    n, m, x, y, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    v = 1 << 60
    for c in [(1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1)]:
        dx = abs(x - c[0])
        
        dy = abs(y - c[1])
        
        if 0 == dx + dy:
            v = 0
        elif dx % a == 0 and dy % b == 0 and dx / a % 2 == dy / b % 2:
            v = min(v, max(dx / a, dy / b))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `v` remain unchanged. If `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the quotient of `dx` divided by `a` has the same parity as the quotient of `dy` divided by `b`, then no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `v` remains the same as the minimum value of the current `v` and the maximum value of the quotients `dx / a` and `dy / b`.
    if (v and (max(n - x, x - 1) < a or max(m - y, y - 1) < b)) :
        v = 1 << 60
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged. If `dx` is divisible by `a` and `dy` is divisible by `b`, and the quotient of `dx` divided by `a` has the same parity as the quotient of `dy` divided by `b`, then no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `v` remains the same as the minimum value of the current `v` and the maximum value of the quotients `dx / a` and `dy / b`. If `v` and the maximum of the absolute differences between `n` and `x`, `m` and `y` with `a` and `b` respectively is less than `a` and `b` respectively, then `v` retains the minimum value of the current `v` and the maximum of the quotients `dx / a` and `dy / b`.
    print('Poor Inna and pony!', v)[v < 1 << 55]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b` and calculates a value `v` based on certain conditions involving these input values. It iterates through different coordinate pairs, calculates distances, and updates the value of `v` accordingly. At the end, it checks `v` against certain conditions and prints a message based on the value of `v`. The function does not have a return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
