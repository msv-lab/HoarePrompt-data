Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of `k / (m - 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not affected. Since `k` is an even integer less than `n*m`, and `m` is even, `m - 1` is odd. Therefore, `t` will be a fraction. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an even integer less than n*m, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `t` is a fraction**
