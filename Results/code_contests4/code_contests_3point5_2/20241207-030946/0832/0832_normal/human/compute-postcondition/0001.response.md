Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value 1. Since the value of `x` is directly given as 1, no calculations or changes are needed for other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, k is a non-negative integer less than n*m, x is 1.
Output State: **n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, k is a non-negative integer less than n*m, x is 1**
