Example Answer:
`k` is decremented by `n`, and since `n` is even, the resulting value of `k` after the operation is also even. The value of `k` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, k is an even integer less than n*m, x is 1, y is 1.
Output State: **n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, k is an even integer less than n*m, x is 1, y is 1**
