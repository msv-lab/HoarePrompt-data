Example Answer:
The value of `p` is calculated as the modulo of `k` and `m - 1`. Since `m` is an even integer, `m - 1` is odd. Given that `k` is an even integer less than `n*m`, the result of `k % (m - 1)` will be an even integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an even integer less than n*m, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `t` is a fraction, `p` is an even integer.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an even integer less than n*m, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `t` is a fraction, `p` is an even integer**
