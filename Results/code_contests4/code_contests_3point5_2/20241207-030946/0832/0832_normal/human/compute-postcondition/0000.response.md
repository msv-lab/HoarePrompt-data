Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on the input given by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, we know that they are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer less than n*m. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer less than n*m.
Output State: **n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer less than n*m.**
