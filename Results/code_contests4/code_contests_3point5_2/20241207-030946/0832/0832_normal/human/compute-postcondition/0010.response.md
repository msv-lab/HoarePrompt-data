Example Answer:
`t` is subtracted from `n` and assigned to `y`. Since the initial state mentions `t` as a fraction without specifying a value, the exact value of `y` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an even integer less than n*m, `x` is 1, `y` is the result of n - t, `t` is a fraction, `p` is an even integer.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an even integer less than n*m, `x` is 1, `y` is the result of n - t, `t` is a fraction, `p` is an even integer**
