Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for n, m, and k, where n and m are even integers between 2 and 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer less than n*m. It then calculates x and y based on the input values, and prints the result. If k - n is less than or equal to -1, it prints y and k + 1. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
