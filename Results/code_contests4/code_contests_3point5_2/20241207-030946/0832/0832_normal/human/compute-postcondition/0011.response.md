Example Answer:
The value of `x` is determined based on the condition `t % 2 == 0`. If `t` is an even number, `x` is assigned the value `2 + p`, otherwise, `m - p`. Since `t` is a fraction and not specified, the exact value of `x` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an even integer less than n*m, `x` is either 2 + p or m - p, `y` is the result of n - t, `t` is a fraction, `p` is an even integer.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an even integer less than n*m, `x` is either 2 + p or m - p, `y` is the result of n - t, `t` is a fraction, `p` is an even integer**
