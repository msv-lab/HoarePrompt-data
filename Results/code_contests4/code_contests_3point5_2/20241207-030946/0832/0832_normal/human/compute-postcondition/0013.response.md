Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(y, x)` will print the values of `y` and `x`. `y` is the result of `n - t`, and `t` is a fraction, so the value of `y` is dependent on the value of `n` and the fraction `t`. `x` is either `2 + p` or `m - p`, depending on the value of `p`. The ceiling value of `y` will be calculated and printed as an integer. 
Output State: **The ceiling value of `y` is printed as an integer, and `x` is printed as an integer.**
