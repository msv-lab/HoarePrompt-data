Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, k is a non-negative integer less than n*m, x is 1, y is 1.
Output State: **n and m are even integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, k is a non-negative integer less than n*m, x is 1, y is 1**
