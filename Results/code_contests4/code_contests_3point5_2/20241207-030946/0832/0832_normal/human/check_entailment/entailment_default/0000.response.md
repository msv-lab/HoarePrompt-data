Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description. There are cases where the code does not produce the correct output. For example, when the input is `4 3 7`, the expected output is `3 2`, but the code produces `3 3`. This discrepancy indicates that the code is not handling all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the code is false.
