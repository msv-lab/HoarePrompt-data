Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes input values for n, m, and k, then calculates the final position of Lara after moving k times according to the specified pattern. The program handles the cases where Lara moves down and then in a snake-like pattern to the right and left until reaching the final position.

The program calculates the final row and column position correctly based on the values of n, m, and k. It ensures that Lara always ends up in the correct cell after moving k times.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
