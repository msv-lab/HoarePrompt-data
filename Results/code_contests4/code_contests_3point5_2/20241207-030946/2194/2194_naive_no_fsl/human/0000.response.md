Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It only considers certain combinations of digits to swap, which may not be sufficient to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number divisible by 25. Additionally, the logic for counting the number of moves and swapping digits is complex and may not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
