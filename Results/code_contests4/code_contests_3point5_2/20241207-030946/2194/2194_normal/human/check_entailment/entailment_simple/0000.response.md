Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the given number divisible by 25 by swapping adjacent digits. The program considers different scenarios based on the counts of '0', '2', '5', and '7' in the input number and applies the swapping logic accordingly. It also handles cases where it may not be possible to make the number divisible by 25 by returning -1.

Overall, the program covers all the requirements stated in the problem description and outputs the correct result for each input scenario.
