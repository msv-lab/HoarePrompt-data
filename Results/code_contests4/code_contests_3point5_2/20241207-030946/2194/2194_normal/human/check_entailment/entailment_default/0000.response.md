Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also provide examples of such cases that the code might not handle correctly. The code seems to be overly complex and might not cover all possible scenarios to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25. The code may need to be revised to ensure it accurately and efficiently solves the given problem.
