Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes an integer input as a string, checks if it is divisible by 25, and then performs a series of calculations to determine the minimum number of moves required to make the number divisible by 25. It considers different cases based on the counts of specific digits in the input string and updates the final answer accordingly. The program also handles cases where it is impossible to make the number divisible by 25 by returning -1. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
