Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 10, `ans` is the total number of elements in list t + 1, `t` is the original list t reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list t if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1, the first element of t is '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and if t[i] is not equal to '0', then the program state remains unchanged.***
