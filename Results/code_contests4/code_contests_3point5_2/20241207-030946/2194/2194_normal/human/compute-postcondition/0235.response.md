Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned the value at index j + 1 in list `t`. The value of `j` is not given, but it is assumed to be a valid index. Therefore, `temp` now holds the value at index j + 1 in list `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`ans` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index j + 1 in list `t`**
