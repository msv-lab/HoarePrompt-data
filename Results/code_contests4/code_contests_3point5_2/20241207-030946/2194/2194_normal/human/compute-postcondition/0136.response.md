According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and the elements in list `t`. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is not '5', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a non-empty list. Since the loop is iterating from `n - 1` to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, the element at index `i-1` in list `t` should not be '5'.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a non-empty list, the element at index `i-1` in list `t` is not '5' for the loop to execute one more time**
