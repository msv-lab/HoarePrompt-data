Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18, `s` is a string input, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `ans += n - 1 - i`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18, `s` is a string input, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `ans += n - 1 - i`, `cnt` is incremented by 1**
