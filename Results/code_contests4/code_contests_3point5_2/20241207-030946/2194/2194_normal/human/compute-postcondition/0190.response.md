According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3. Additionally, since the loop starts from `n - 3`, the loop will execute `n - 3` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3, `ans` is the total number of elements in list `t`, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list `t` if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1, the first element of `t` is '0', and `n` is not equal to 3.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `ans` is the total number of elements in list `t`, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list `t` if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1, the first element of `t` is '0', and `n` is not equal to 3**
