Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated based on the calculation `ans += n - 1 - i`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are known, so the new value of `ans` can be calculated based on that. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18, `s` is a string input, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `ans += n - 1 - i`**
