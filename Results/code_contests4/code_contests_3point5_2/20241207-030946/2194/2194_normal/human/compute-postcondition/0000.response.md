Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of the input as a string. The value of `n` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeroes; s is a string input.
Output State: **n is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeroes; s is a string input**
