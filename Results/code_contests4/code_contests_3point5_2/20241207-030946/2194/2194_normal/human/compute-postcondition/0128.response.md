Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeroes; `s` is a string input; `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`; `five`, `two`, `seven` are the counts of '5', '2', '7' respectively in `s; `ans` is updated based on the calculations within the loop; `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions met within the loop; `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans` + 2. If there are at least one '2' and one '5' in the string `s`, the function enters the if block. Inside the if block, `t` is a list created from `s` where elements are shifted to the right, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2' in the reversed list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of the element at index `i + 1` in list `t`. The first element of list `t` is set to '0' if `n` is 3 or not '0' otherwise. The loop does not execute after the if block. Additionally, there is at least one '7' and one '5' in the string `s`***
