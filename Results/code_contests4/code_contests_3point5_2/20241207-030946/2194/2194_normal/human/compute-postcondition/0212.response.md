According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse order from `n - 1` to 0, it means `n` should be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1` and it is the first iteration.

State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
