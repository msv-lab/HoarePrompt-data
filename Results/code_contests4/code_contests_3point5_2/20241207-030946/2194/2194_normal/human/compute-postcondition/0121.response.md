Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string input, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `five` is the count of '5' in `s`, `two` is the count of '2' in `s`, `seven` is the count of '7' in `s`, `ans` is equal to the number of elements in `t` plus 2, `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans` + 2, `t` is a list created from the string `s` with elements shifted to the right, `i` is 1, and `t[i]` is not '0' for the loop to execute a second time. After the if else block executes, the program is in the same state as before with no changes in any variables.***
