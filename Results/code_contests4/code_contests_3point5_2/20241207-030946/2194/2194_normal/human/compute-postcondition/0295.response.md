Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string input `s` and performs a series of calculations based on the counts of specific digits in the string. It then updates the value of `fin` based on these calculations and prints either -1 if `fin` exceeds 10^10 or the final value of `fin`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value. **
