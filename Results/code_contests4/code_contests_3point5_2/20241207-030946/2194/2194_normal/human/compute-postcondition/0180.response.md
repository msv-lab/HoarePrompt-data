According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is updated to `j + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 1` should be less than `n - 2`. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n - 1`.
State: **`n` is adjusted to `n - 1`, `ans` is the total number of elements in list `t` plus 1, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list `t` if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `temp` is assigned the new value based on the updated `j`, the value at index `j + 1` in list `t` is updated to the value at index `j`**.
