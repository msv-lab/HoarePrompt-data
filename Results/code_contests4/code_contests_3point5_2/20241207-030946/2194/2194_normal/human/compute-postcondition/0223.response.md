According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and if there is at least one element '0' in the list `t`. The loop will run until `i` becomes -1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `t` is a list with at least one element '0'.**
