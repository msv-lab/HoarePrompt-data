Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`. The value of `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, so `temp` now holds the value at the next index of `j` in list `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2` if `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, and if `t` contains '5', then we break out of the loop.
Output State: **`ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2` if `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, and if `t` contains '5', then we break out of the loop**
