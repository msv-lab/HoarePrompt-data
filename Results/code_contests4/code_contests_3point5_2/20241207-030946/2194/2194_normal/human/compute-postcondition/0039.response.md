Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated based on the calculation `ans += n - 2 - i`. The previous values of `ans`, `n`, and `i` are unknown, so it is not possible to determine the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer from 1 to 10^18, s is a string input.
Output State: **n is an integer from 1 to 10^18, s is a string input**
