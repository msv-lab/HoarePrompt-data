Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `j + 1`, `j` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 2]` is assigned the value of `t[j].
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `j + 1`, `j` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 2]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`.**
