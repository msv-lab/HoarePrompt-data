Example Answer:
`ans` is initialized to 0. The length of list `t` is assigned to `n`, but the specific value of `n` is not given. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to the length of list `t`, `ans` is initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is updated to the length of list `t`, `ans` is initialized to 0**
