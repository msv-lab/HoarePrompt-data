According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, which means `i` should be `n - 3`. 
State: **`ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index `j` in list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, and the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
