According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 2, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new '5' index, `j` is updated based on the new '5' index, `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` and `j` need to be adjusted to the next iteration values.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 2, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new '5' index, `j` is updated based on the new '5' index, `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented and `j` is incremented**
