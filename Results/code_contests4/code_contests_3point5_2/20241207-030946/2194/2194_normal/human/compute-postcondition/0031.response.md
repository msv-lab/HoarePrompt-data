Output State: **n is an integer from 1 to 10^18, s is a string input, zero is the count of '0' in s which is greater than or equal to 2, five, two, seven are the counts of '5', '2', '7' respectively in s, ans is updated based on the calculation ans += n - 2 - i, cnt is 3, and we break out of the innermost loop or if statement. The character at index i in s is '0'. The count cnt is not equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time i must be adjusted accordingly to progress in reverse order.**
