Output State: **`ans` is assigned the value 10^15, `n` is equal to 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at the last index of list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, if `t` contains '5' we break out of the loop, and `t` is reversed in the end. Additionally, the first element of `t` is '0'**
