According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `t[i] == '7'` is not satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `ans`, `t`, `i`, `j` have specific values defined in the precondition. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be decremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `ans`, `t`, `i-1`, `j` have specific values defined in the precondition, for the loop to execute one more time the condition t[i-1] == '7' should not be satisfied**
