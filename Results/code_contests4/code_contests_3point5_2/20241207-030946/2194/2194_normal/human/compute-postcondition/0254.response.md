Output State: `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2` if `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, and if `t` contains '5', then we break out of the loop, and `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j] at index `j`. After executing the code `t[j] = temp`, the value at index `j` in list `t` is updated to the value of `temp`.
