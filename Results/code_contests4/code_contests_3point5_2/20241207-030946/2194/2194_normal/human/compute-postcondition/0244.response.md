Output State: **`ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index `j` in list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, and the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
